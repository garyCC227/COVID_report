            "main_text": "A faulty reagent in a test kit distributed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has hampered efforts to find and confirm COVID-19 cases.By Jon CohenFeb. 28, 2020 , 5:45 PMSpeed is critical in the response to COVID-19. So why has the United States been so slow in its attempt to develop reliable diagnostic tests and use them widely?The World Health Organization (WHO) has shipped testing kits to 57 countries. China had five commercial tests on the market 1 month ago and can now do up to 1.6 million tests a week; South Korea has tested 65,000 people so far. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in contrast, has done only 459 tests since the epidemic began. The rollout of a CDC-designed test kit to state and local labs has become a fiasco because it contained a faulty reagent. Labs around the country eager to test more suspected cases\u2014and test them faster\u2014have been unable to do so. No commercial or state labs have the approval to use their own tests.In what is already an infamous snafu, CDC initially refused a request to test a patient in Northern California who turned out to be the first probable COVID19 case without known links to an infected person.The situation may soon improve. State labs and commercial diagnostic developers hope to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for their own tests, and FDA and CDC on Wednesday agreed on a workaround for the faulty CDC kit\u2014which has a problem that is not essential to its proper functioning\u2014so that it can now be used by at least some of the state labs that have it.But there\u2019s widespread discontent with the way the system has worked. \u201cThe U.S. government has not appropriately prioritized diagnostic tests and supported the laboratory response network to the degree they should have been supported over the years,\u201d says Luciana Borio, who in previous jobs had lead roles in responding to emerging threats at the National Security Council and FDA.If a new disease emerges, CDC normally \u201cgets the ball rolling\u201d with diagnostics because it has the expertise and the biosafety laboratories to handle dangerous novel pathogens, says Borio, who now works for In-Q-Tel, a not-for-profit venture capital firm. Typically, there are few confirmed viral samples from patients at the outset, which researchers need to validate their tests, and CDC has the capability to grow the virus for this critical quality assurance step. Once the agency has a working test, that goes out to state labs. Then, in a third phase, commercial labs take over and either produce their own tests or scale-up the CDC one. \u201cI would have hoped to see that third phase by now,\u201d Borio says.In the case of SARS-CoV-2, as the virus causing COVID-19 is officially known, CDC\u2019s sluggishness was apparent 1\u00a0month ago. On 26 January, the agency held an unusual Sunday teleconference for the media to provide an update about the rapidly growing outbreak. There were then five cases in the United States, but the CDC lab in Atlanta was still the only one in the country able to test for the virus, and it repeatedly had backlogs. Asked why more labs weren\u2019t able to do the tests, Nancy Messonnier, who then was leading CDC\u2019s response, said it was a quality issue. \u201cWe hold ourselves to an incredibly high standard of precision in terms of laboratory testing,\u201d Messonnier said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want to inadvertently make a mistake in patient care.\u201dCDC finally started to send\u00a0kits to state and local health labs on 5 February. But on 12 February, it revealed that several labs had difficulty validating the test because of a problem with one of the reagents.The key problem with the kits is what\u2019s known as a negative control, says Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious diseases at the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL). CDC\u2019s test uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to find tiny amounts of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in, say, a nose swab. To make sure a test is working properly, kits also include DNA unrelated to SARS-CoV-2. The assay should not react to this negative control, but the CDC reagents did at many, but not all, state labs. The labs where the negative control failed were not allowed to use the test; they have to continue to send their samples to Atlanta.The declaration of a public health emergency \u2026 limited the diagnostic capacity of this country. It\u2019s insane.But at the moment, they\u2019re not allowed to do that without FDA approval. When the United States\u00a0declared the outbreak\u00a0a public health emergency\u00a0on 31 January, a bureaucratic process kicked in that requires FDA\u2019s \u201cemergency use approval\u201d for any tests. \u201cThe declaration of a public health emergency did exactly what it shouldn\u2019t have. It limited the diagnostic capacity of this country,\u201d Mina says. \u201cIt\u2019s insane.\u201dOn 24 February, APHL asked FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn for \u201cenforcement discretion\u201d to sidestep the emergency process and allow APHL members labs to use their own tests. On 26 February, Hahn replied that the CDC test could be modified to use just the primers that specifically detect SARS-CoV-2, essentially ignoring the faulty portion of the kits. FDA, in other words, would look the other way to make more widespread testing possible.CDC has notified labs of FDA\u2019s decision in a letter, but the agency must still file an emergency use authorization with FDA for the protocol change. Once it does, it won\u2019t take long, Hahn promised in his letter to APHL: \u201cFDA has been able to authorize tests for public health emergencies within as little as 1 day upon receipt of the complete validation.\u201dIn New York, the State Department of Health has\u00a0designed its own test\u00a0based on the CDC protocol and plans to seek emergency use authorization.CDC provided an update about the situation in an email but did not respond to\u00a0Science\u2019s\u00a0request for an interview with a scientist to discuss the details of the problem. Mina stresses he has great respect for CDC\u2019s competence overall, but says, \u201cThere\u2019s no good explanation for what\u2019s going on here.\u201ddoi:10.1126/science.abb5152Jon is a staff writer for Science.By Jon CohenMar. 9, 2020By Rodrigo P\u00e9rez Ortega Feb. 27, 2020By Rodrigo P\u00e9rez Ortega Feb. 26, 2020By Rodrigo P\u00e9rez Ortega Feb. 21, 2020By Rodrigo P\u00e9rez Ortega Jan. 21, 2020More SifterVol 367,\n\n      Issue 6483\u00a9 2020\u00a0American Association for the Advancement of Science.

            "main_text": "Public health agencies around the world are preparing for COVID-19, the novel coronavirus that has spread from China to multiple regions of the world. We now see more cases outside of China than inside, and we\u2019re also hearing of cases inside the U.S. among people without known travel contact. One critical lesson from our experience with H1N1 a decade ago is worth highlighting: We must integrate our nation\u2019s 5,000 jails, prisons and immigration detention centers with our pandemic response efforts.In the spring of 2009, we also faced a novel viral threat to health in the form of H1N1, which the CDC now estimates took between approximately 150,000 and 500,000 lives worldwide in the first 12 months of activity. Much of this illness occurred among young people, who lacked antibodies for this strain of flu. Working inside the health service of the New York City jail system, we confronted a wide array of issues in responding to H1N1, from decisions about how to set up surveillance for influenza-like illness, to diagnosis and treatment of suspected cases and isolation of housing areas of the jails where people were ill.One large advantage we had was that our health service was a division of the nation\u2019s pre-eminent public health department, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). In the decade since, I\u2019ve responded to seasonal influenza, pertussis, legionella and many other outbreaks within correctional settings. Here are a few lessons that are critical for sheriffs, commissioners of correction and public health officials to consider.COVID-19 will remind us of a central hypocrisy in our approach to health behind bars. We\u2019ve built the world\u2019s largest collection of jails and prisons, and kept the health services in these places remarkably separate from the rest of our national health systems. The CDC, state departments of health, the Joint Commission and other bodies that promote evidence-based care in our hospitals, ambulatory care clinics and nursing homes are largely absent in these settings. As a result, management of this pandemic will be harder and less effective for incarcerated people, their families and staff in these institutions.As we struggle to make headway in this specific response, it should remind us that the goals of promoting health and addressing mass incarceration both require that we finally connect these institutions to our community-based systems of health.Dr. Homer Venters is the former chief medical officer of the New York City Jail System and president of Community Oriented Correctional Health Services (COCHS).View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92020 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc.",

            "main_text": "The port of Baltimore\u2019s booming container terminal will reduce its operating hours next week because of declines in incoming cargo due to the international coronavirus outbreak, officials said Friday.Seagirt Marine Terminal will open at 7 a.m., and the inbound gate will close at 4:45 p.m. beginning Sunday, according to Ports America Chesapeake, the company that operates the state-owned terminal under a 50-year agreement.
