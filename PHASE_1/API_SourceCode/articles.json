The affected batch numbers are:At this time, no batches of any of the drugs listed below are subject to a recall.

It may take several days for a blood culture to become positive and may be difficult for a laboratory to identify. Possible initial identifications include Stenotrophomonas, Burkholderia and Pseudomonas species of bacteria.The TGA investigation is ongoing.Your email address will not be published.

            "main_text": "PRESS RELEASEQueensland\u2019s Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young has recently received an e-petition from almost 500 concerned citizens asking her to publicly denounce the Australian Vaccination Sceptics Network (AVSN) and their participation in a healthy lifestyle expo on the Sunshine Coast.Dr Young said she has always shown unwavering support for vaccinations and is very supportive of any positive messages encouraging parents to vaccinate.\u201cIt is my understanding that the Sunshine Coast Public Health Unit told the organisers months ago that Queensland Health would not be participating in any vaccination debates.\u201cLike every state of Australia we are very pro-vaccination and will continue to disseminate positive messages about the benefits of vaccination,\u201d Dr Young said.\u201cThe bottom line is that most people accept vaccination as a vital component of protecting their child from preventable disease.\u201cAs a society we have an obligation to protect our children. If you are not vaccinating your child you are potentially not only harming them, but also children who can\u2019t be vaccinated \u2013 like kids with cancer and babies less than six months old.\u201cThere are some very small, but vocal groups like the AVSN who insist on spreading misinformation and debunked theories.\u201cWhile I wholeheartedly disagree with them, legally I am in no position to restrict their movements in this state.\u201cThis is not a debate about \u2018free speech\u2019; it\u2019s about the fact that there\u2019s a small percentage of people who are under the misconception that there are two sides to this story, because there simply isn\u2019t.\u201cI am on the record saying most parents do the right thing and vaccinate their children. The majority of Queensland regions have 90% or more of their children vaccinated across all age groups.\u201cWe will continue our work on some of the areas that could be higher.\u201cWe do not believe that attending an expo and being some sort of drawcard with \u2018debate\u2019 between the AVSN and Queensland Health is going to help our cause.\u201cIf event organisers of health expos practiced due diligence, they would not invite groups such as AVSN to participate because that organisation is not \u2018healthy\u2019 at all.\u201cAnyone with concerns about the presence of the AVSN should direct them to the event organisers,\u201d she said.Your email address will not be published.

It can affect anyone, although it is more common in people who live in tropical areas with poor sanitary conditions.\u00a0For more infectious disease news and information, visit and \u201clike\u201d the Infectious Disease News Facebook page.People mostly get infected with the parasite from ingestion of fecally contaminated food and water containing the amebic cysts. Transmission can also occur through oral-anal contact with a chronically ill or asymptomatic carrier.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only about 10% to 20% of people who are infected with\u00a0E. histolytica\u00a0become sick from the infection. Of those who do become sick,\u00a0symptoms may include\u00a0stomach pain, bloody stools (poop), and fever. Rarely,\u00a0E. histolytica\u00a0invades the liver and forms an abscess (a collection of pus). In a small number of instances, it has been shown to spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs or brain, but this is very uncommon.Your email address will not be published.

            "headline": "Australia: Bandicoot droppings linked to Salmonella Java outbreak in Northern Beaches",
            "main_text": "The Northern Sydney Public Health Unit is reporting an increase in the number of cases of Salmonella\u00a0among toddlers and young children on the Northern Beaches and warn parents that bandicoot droppings may be the source of the infection.Northern Sydney Local Health District\u2019s Director Public Health, Dr Michael Staff said the outbreak strain,\u00a0 Salmonella Java,\u00a0can be caused by accidentally ingesting material containing the bacterium. In the past few years young children on the Northern Beaches have been diagnosed with the condition after ingesting sand from public parks and child care centres.He said testing and removal of the effected sand from play areas had controlled, but not eliminated, cases of the illness in recent years. \u00a0Dr Staff said cases of Salmonella Java began appearing again in February, following several months when no cases had been reported.\u201cSo far this year we\u2019ve had 19 cases confirmed and while some have been traced to play area sand, it appears that many children may have been infected by contact with bandicoot droppings,\u201d he said.\u00a0For more infectious disease news and information, visit and \u201clike\u201d the Infectious Disease News Facebook page.The vast majority of parents with sick children this year had reported increased bandicoot activity in their backyards: \u201cThey\u2019ve reported conical holes in their lawns, which is a sure sign of bandicoot activity,\u201d Dr Staff said.The Northern Sydney Public Health Unit had inspected the backyards of several cases and bandicoot droppings collected at one property had tested positive for the Salmonella Java, Dr Staff added.He believes children may be coming into indirect contact with bandicoot droppings while playing in their backyards. \u201cYoung children tend to put their fingers in their mouths a lot and this could transfer the bacterium to\nthem if they have touched a contaminated surface.\u201dOften confused with rodents, bandicoots are small, omnivorous marsupials. They\u00a0are about the size of a rabbit, and have a pointy snout\u00a0, humped back, thin tail and large hind feet.\u00a0There are around 20 species of bandicoots, three of which are found in NSW.Early signs of Salmonella Java poisoning include fever, nausea, vomiting, stomach pains and diarrhea.To prevent further spread of the illness, the Public Health Unit recommended parents of young children cleared animal droppings from areas where their children played, discouraged children from putting their hands or toys in their mouth when playing outside, and make sure their children washed their hands after playing outside.Chicken wire mesh at least 50cm high and 15cm would stop bandicoots entering backyards.Your email address will not be published.
