Andersen\nDepartment of Immunology and Microbiology,\nThe Scripps Research Institute,\nLa Jolla, CA 92037,\nUSA.Since the first reports of a novel pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China there has been considerable discussion and uncertainty over the origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 are now widespread in China, with cases in every province. As of 14 February 2020, 64,473 such cases have been confirmed, with 1,384 deaths attributed to the virus. These official case numbers are likely an underestimate because of limited reporting of mild and asymptomatic cases, and the virus is clearly capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. Based on the possibility of spread to countries with weaker healthcare systems, the World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). There are currently neither vaccines nor specific treatments for this disease.SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the  Coronaviridae  known to infect humans. Three of these viruses, SARS CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, can cause severe disease; four, HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E, are associated with mild respiratory symptoms. Herein, we review what can be deduced about the origin and early evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from the comparative analysis of available genome sequence data. In particular, we offer a perspective on the notable features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and discuss scenarios by which these features could have arisen. Importantly, this analysis provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct nor a purposefully manipulated virus.The genomic comparison of both alpha- and betacoronaviruses (family  Coronaviridae ) described below identifies two notable features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (i) based on structural modelling and early biochemical experiments, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be optimized for binding to the human ACE2 receptor; (ii) the highly variable spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1 and S2 boundary via the insertion of twelve nucleotides. Additionally, this event led to the acquisition of three predicted O-linked glycans around the polybasic cleavage site.The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses is the most variable part of the virus genome. Six residues in the RBD appear to be critical for binding to the human ACE2 receptor and determining host range1. Using coordinates based on the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV, they are Y442, L472, N479, D480, T487, and Y4911. The corresponding residues in SARS-CoV-2 are L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501, and Y505. Five of these six residues are mutated in SARS-CoV-2 compared to its most closely related virus, RaTG13 sampled from a  Rhinolophus affinis  bat, to which it is ~96% identical2 (Figure 1a). Based on modeling1 and biochemical experiments3,4, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have an RBD that may bind with high affinity to ACE2 from human, non-human primate, ferret, pig, and cat, as well as other species with high receptor homology1. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 may bind less efficiently to ACE2 in other species associated with SARS-like viruses, including rodents and civets1.The phenylalanine (F) at residue 486 in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein corresponds to L472 in the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. Notably, in SARS-CoV cell culture experiments the L472 mutates to phenylalanine (L472F)5, which is predicted to be optimal for binding of the SARS-CoV RBD to the human ACE2 receptor6. However, a phenylalanine in this position is also present in several SARS-like CoVs from bats (Figure 1a). While these analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of binding the human ACE2 receptor with high affinity, the interaction is not predicted to be optimal1. Additionally, several of the key residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 are different to those previously described as optimal for human ACE2 receptor binding6. In contrast to these computational predictions, recent binding studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 binds with high affinity to human ACE27. Thus the SARS-CoV-2 spike appears to be the result of selection on human or human-like ACE2 permitting another optimal binding solution to arise. This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is  not  the product of genetic engineering.The second notable feature of SARS-CoV-2 is a predicted polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2, the two subunits of the spike protein (Figure 1b)8,9. In addition to two basic arginines and an alanine at the cleavage site, a leading proline is also inserted; thus, the fully inserted sequence is PRRA (Figure 1b). The strong turn created by the proline insertion is predicted to result in the addition of O-linked glycans to S673, T678, and S686 that flank the polybasic cleavage site. A polybasic cleavage site has not previously been observed in related lineage B betacoronaviruses and is a unique feature of SARS-CoV-2. Some human betacoronaviruses, including HCoV-HKU1 (lineage A), have polybasic cleavage sites, as well as predicted O-linked glycans near the S1/S2 cleavage site.While the functional consequence of the polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, experiments with SARS-CoV have shown that engineering such a site at the S1/S2 junction enhances cell\u2013cell fusion but does not affect virus entry10. Polybasic cleavage sites allow effective cleavage by furin and other proteases, and can be acquired at the junction of the two subunits of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of avian influenza viruses in conditions that select for rapid virus replication and transmission (e.g. highly dense chicken populations). HA serves a similar function in cell-cell fusion and viral entry as the coronavirus S protein. Acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site in HA, by either insertion or recombination, converts low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses into highly pathogenic forms11-13. The acquisition of polybasic cleavage sites by the influenza virus HA has also been observed after repeated forced passage in cell culture or through animals14,15. Similarly, an avirulent isolate of Newcastle Disease virus became highly pathogenic during serial passage in chickens by incremental acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site at the junction of its fusion protein subunits16. The potential function of the three predicted O-linked glycans is less clear, but they could create a \u201cmucin-like domain\u201d that would shield potential epitopes or key residues on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Biochemical analyses or structural studies are required to determine whether or not the predicted O-linked glycan sites are utilized.figure2718\u00d71487 394 KBFigure 1. (a) Mutations in contact residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (top) was aligned against the most closely related SARS-like CoVs and SARS-CoV-1. Key residues in the spike protein that make contact to the ACE2 receptor are marked with blue boxes in both SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. ( b) Acquisition of polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans.  The polybasic cleavage site is marked in grey with the three adjacent predicted O-linked glycans in blue. Both the polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and not previously seen in lineage B betacoronaviruses. Sequences shown are from NCBI GenBank, accession numbers MN908947, MN996532, AY278741, KY417146, MK211376. The pangolin coronavirus sequences are a consensus generated from SRR10168377 and SRR10168378 (NCBI BioProject PRJNA573298)18,19.It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of an existing SARS-related coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for human ACE2 receptor binding with an efficient binding solution different to that which would have been predicted. Further, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one would expect that one of the several reverse genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would have been used. However, this is not the case as the genetic data shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone17. Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in a non-human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage in culture could have given rise to the same observed features.Selection in an animal host. As many of the early cases of COVID-19 were linked to the Huanan seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, it is possible that an animal source was present at this location. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, particularly RaTG13, it is plausible that bats serve as reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2. It is important, however, to note that previous outbreaks of betacoronaviruses in humans involved direct exposure to animals other than bats, including civets (SARS) and camels (MERS), that carry viruses that are genetically very similar to SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, respectively. By analogy, viruses closely related to SARS-Cov-2 may be circulating in one or more animal species. Initial analyses indicate that Malayan pangolins ( Manis javanica ) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain a CoV that is similar to SARS-CoV-218,19. Although the bat virus RaTG13 remains the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 across the whole genome, the Malayan pangolin CoV is identical to SARS-CoV-2 at all six key RBD residues (Figure 1). However, no pangolin CoV has yet been identified that is sufficiently similar to SARS-CoV-2 across its entire genome to support direct human infection. In addition, the pangolin CoV does not carry a polybasic cleavage site insertion. For a precursor virus to acquire the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the spike protein suitable for human ACE2 receptor binding, an animal host would likely have to have a high population density \u2013 to allow natural selection to proceed efficiently \u2013 and an ACE2 gene that is similar to the human orthologue. Further characterization of CoVs in pangolins and other animals that may harbour SARS-CoV-like viruses should be a public health priority.Cryptic adaptation to humans. It is also possible that a progenitor to SARS-CoV-2 jumped from a non-human animal to humans, with the genomic features described above acquired through adaptation during subsequent human-to-human transmission. We surmise that once these adaptations were acquired (either together or in series) it would enable the outbreak to take-off, producing a sufficiently large and unusual cluster of pneumonia cases to trigger the surveillance system that ultimately detected it.All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced so far have the well adapted RBD and the polybasic cleavage site, and are thus derived from a common ancestor that had these features. The presence of an RBD in pangolins that is very similar to the one in SARS-CoV-2 means that this was likely already present in the virus that jumped to humans, even if we don\u2019t yet have the exact non-human progenitor virus. This leaves the polybasic cleavage site insertion to occur during human-to-human transmission. Following the example of the influenza A virus HA gene, a specific insertion or recombination event is required to enable the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as an epidemic pathogen.Estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 using currently available genome sequence data point to virus emergence in late November to early December 201920,21, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases22. Hence, this scenario presumes a period of unrecognised transmission in humans between the initial zoonotic transfer event and the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site. Sufficient opportunity could occur if there had been many prior zoonotic events producing short chains of human-to-human transmission (so-called \u2018stuttering chains\u2019) over an extended period. This is essentially the situation for MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula where all the human cases are the result of repeated jumps of the virus from dromedary camels, producing single infections or short chains of transmission that eventually resolve. To date, after 2,499 cases over 8 years, no human adaptation has emerged that has allowed MERS-CoV to take hold in the human population.How could we test whether cryptic spread of SARS-CoV-2 enabled human adaptation?  Metagenomic studies of banked serum samples could provide important information, but given the relatively short period of viremia it may be impossible to detect low level SARS-CoV-2 circulation in historical samples. Retrospective serological studies potentially could be informative and a few such studies have already been conducted. One found that animal importation traders had a 13% seropositivity to coronaviruses23, while another noted that 3% residents of a village in Southern China were seropositive to these viruses24. Interestingly, 200 residents of Wuhan did not show coronavirus seroreactivity. Critically, however, these studies could not have distinguished whether positive serological responses were due to a prior infection with SARS-CoV-1 or -2. Further retrospective serological studies should be conducted to determine the extent of prior human exposure to betacoronaviruses in different geographic areas, particularly using assays that can distinguish among multiple betacoronaviruses.Selection during passage. Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models have been ongoing in BSL-2 for many years in multiple laboratories across the world25-28. There are also documented instances of the laboratory acquisition of SARS-CoV-1 by laboratory personnel working under BSL-2 containment29,30. We must therefore consider the possibility of a deliberate or inadvertent release of SARS-CoV-2. In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired the observed RBD mutations site during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in studies with SARS-CoV5 as well as MERS-CoV31. However, the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site or O-linked glycans - if functional - argues against this scenario. New polybasic cleavage sites have only been observed after prolonged passaging of low pathogenicity avian influenza virus in cell culture or animals. Furthermore, the generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with a very high genetic similarity. Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required an intense program of passage in cell culture or animals with ACE-2 receptor similar to humans (e.g. ferrets). It is also questionable whether generation of the O-linked glycans would have occurred on cell culture passage, as such mutations typically suggest the involvement of an immune system, that is not present  in vitro .In the midst of the global COVID-19 public health emergency it is reasonable to wonder why the origins of the epidemic matter. A detailed understanding of how an animal virus jumped species boundaries to infect humans so productively will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events. For example, if SARS-CoV-2 pre-adapted in another animal species then we are at risk of future re-emergence events even if the current epidemic is controlled. In contrast, if the adaptive process we describe occurred in humans, then even if we have repeated zoonotic transfers they are unlikely to take-off unless the same series of mutations occurs. In addition, identifying the closest animal relatives of SARS-CoV-2 will greatly assist studies of virus function. Indeed, the availability of the RaTG13 bat sequence facilitated the comparative genomic analysis performed here, helping to reveal the key mutations in the RBD as well as the polybasic cleavage site insertion.The genomic features described here may in part explain the infectiousness and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Although genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here, and it is unclear whether future data will help resolve this issue. Identifying the immediate non-human animal source and obtaining virus sequences from it would be the most definitive way of revealing virus origins. In addition, it would be helpful to obtain more genetic and functional data about the virus, including experimental studies of receptor binding and the role of the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans. The identification of a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the sequencing of very early cases including those not connected to the Wuhan market, would similarly be highly informative. Irrespective of how SARS-CoV-2 originated, the ongoing surveillance of pneumonia in humans and other animals is clearly of utmost importance.We thank all those who have contributed SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and contributed analyses and ideas to Virological.org (http://virological.org/).

I would add, however, that even if two virus isolates have an IDENTICAL amino acid sequence, that would not automatically make one the origin of the other. In my post 10 days ago, Tackling Rumors of a Suspicious Origin of nCoV2019 , I showed that mutations in the 3rd wobble base in an otherwise conserved region accumulate as to make seemingly identical viruses very much separated in time \u2013 indeed over decades.It is time to leave playing \u201cwho\u2019s ur daddy\u201d to daytime television. No known viral RNA sequence is the daddy of SARS-CoV-2. No match. If it doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit. It is all bat guano. Whatever analogy you like.

Andersen\nDepartment of Immunology and Microbiology,\nThe Scripps Research Institute,\nLa Jolla, CA 92037,\nUSA.Since the first reports of a novel pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China there has been considerable discussion and uncertainty over the origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 are now widespread in China, with cases in every province. As of 14 February 2020, 64,473 such cases have been confirmed, with 1,384 deaths attributed to the virus. These official case numbers are likely an underestimate because of limited reporting of mild and asymptomatic cases, and the virus is clearly capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. Based on the possibility of spread to countries with weaker healthcare systems, the World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). There are currently neither vaccines nor specific treatments for this disease.SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the  Coronaviridae  known to infect humans. Three of these viruses, SARS CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, can cause severe disease; four, HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E, are associated with mild respiratory symptoms. Herein, we review what can be deduced about the origin and early evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from the comparative analysis of available genome sequence data. In particular, we offer a perspective on the notable features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and discuss scenarios by which these features could have arisen. Importantly, this analysis provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct nor a purposefully manipulated virus.The genomic comparison of both alpha- and betacoronaviruses (family  Coronaviridae ) described below identifies two notable features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (i) based on structural modelling and early biochemical experiments, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be optimized for binding to the human ACE2 receptor; (ii) the highly variable spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1 and S2 boundary via the insertion of twelve nucleotides. Additionally, this event led to the acquisition of three predicted O-linked glycans around the polybasic cleavage site.The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses is the most variable part of the virus genome. Six residues in the RBD appear to be critical for binding to the human ACE2 receptor and determining host range1. Using coordinates based on the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV, they are Y442, L472, N479, D480, T487, and Y4911. The corresponding residues in SARS-CoV-2 are L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501, and Y505. Five of these six residues are mutated in SARS-CoV-2 compared to its most closely related virus, RaTG13 sampled from a  Rhinolophus affinis  bat, to which it is ~96% identical2 (Figure 1a). Based on modeling1 and biochemical experiments3,4, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have an RBD that may bind with high affinity to ACE2 from human, non-human primate, ferret, pig, and cat, as well as other species with high receptor homology1. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 may bind less efficiently to ACE2 in other species associated with SARS-like viruses, including rodents and civets1.The phenylalanine (F) at residue 486 in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein corresponds to L472 in the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. Notably, in SARS-CoV cell culture experiments the L472 mutates to phenylalanine (L472F)5, which is predicted to be optimal for binding of the SARS-CoV RBD to the human ACE2 receptor6. However, a phenylalanine in this position is also present in several SARS-like CoVs from bats (Figure 1a). While these analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of binding the human ACE2 receptor with high affinity, the interaction is not predicted to be optimal1. Additionally, several of the key residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 are different to those previously described as optimal for human ACE2 receptor binding6. In contrast to these computational predictions, recent binding studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 binds with high affinity to human ACE27. Thus the SARS-CoV-2 spike appears to be the result of selection on human or human-like ACE2 permitting another optimal binding solution to arise. This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is  not  the product of genetic engineering.The second notable feature of SARS-CoV-2 is a predicted polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2, the two subunits of the spike protein (Figure 1b)8,9. In addition to two basic arginines and an alanine at the cleavage site, a leading proline is also inserted; thus, the fully inserted sequence is PRRA (Figure 1b). The strong turn created by the proline insertion is predicted to result in the addition of O-linked glycans to S673, T678, and S686 that flank the polybasic cleavage site. A polybasic cleavage site has not previously been observed in related lineage B betacoronaviruses and is a unique feature of SARS-CoV-2. Some human betacoronaviruses, including HCoV-HKU1 (lineage A), have polybasic cleavage sites, as well as predicted O-linked glycans near the S1/S2 cleavage site.While the functional consequence of the polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, experiments with SARS-CoV have shown that engineering such a site at the S1/S2 junction enhances cell\u2013cell fusion but does not affect virus entry10. Polybasic cleavage sites allow effective cleavage by furin and other proteases, and can be acquired at the junction of the two subunits of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of avian influenza viruses in conditions that select for rapid virus replication and transmission (e.g. highly dense chicken populations). HA serves a similar function in cell-cell fusion and viral entry as the coronavirus S protein. Acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site in HA, by either insertion or recombination, converts low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses into highly pathogenic forms11-13. The acquisition of polybasic cleavage sites by the influenza virus HA has also been observed after repeated forced passage in cell culture or through animals14,15. Similarly, an avirulent isolate of Newcastle Disease virus became highly pathogenic during serial passage in chickens by incremental acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site at the junction of its fusion protein subunits16. The potential function of the three predicted O-linked glycans is less clear, but they could create a \u201cmucin-like domain\u201d that would shield potential epitopes or key residues on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Biochemical analyses or structural studies are required to determine whether or not the predicted O-linked glycan sites are utilized.figure2718\u00d71487 394 KBFigure 1. (a) Mutations in contact residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (top) was aligned against the most closely related SARS-like CoVs and SARS-CoV-1. Key residues in the spike protein that make contact to the ACE2 receptor are marked with blue boxes in both SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. ( b) Acquisition of polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans.  The polybasic cleavage site is marked in grey with the three adjacent predicted O-linked glycans in blue. Both the polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and not previously seen in lineage B betacoronaviruses. Sequences shown are from NCBI GenBank, accession numbers MN908947, MN996532, AY278741, KY417146, MK211376. The pangolin coronavirus sequences are a consensus generated from SRR10168377 and SRR10168378 (NCBI BioProject PRJNA573298)18,19.It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of an existing SARS-related coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for human ACE2 receptor binding with an efficient binding solution different to that which would have been predicted. Further, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one would expect that one of the several reverse genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would have been used. However, this is not the case as the genetic data shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone17. Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in a non-human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage in culture could have given rise to the same observed features.Selection in an animal host. As many of the early cases of COVID-19 were linked to the Huanan seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, it is possible that an animal source was present at this location. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, particularly RaTG13, it is plausible that bats serve as reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2. It is important, however, to note that previous outbreaks of betacoronaviruses in humans involved direct exposure to animals other than bats, including civets (SARS) and camels (MERS), that carry viruses that are genetically very similar to SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, respectively. By analogy, viruses closely related to SARS-Cov-2 may be circulating in one or more animal species. Initial analyses indicate that Malayan pangolins ( Manis javanica ) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain a CoV that is similar to SARS-CoV-218,19. Although the bat virus RaTG13 remains the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 across the whole genome, the Malayan pangolin CoV is identical to SARS-CoV-2 at all six key RBD residues (Figure 1). However, no pangolin CoV has yet been identified that is sufficiently similar to SARS-CoV-2 across its entire genome to support direct human infection. In addition, the pangolin CoV does not carry a polybasic cleavage site insertion. For a precursor virus to acquire the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the spike protein suitable for human ACE2 receptor binding, an animal host would likely have to have a high population density \u2013 to allow natural selection to proceed efficiently \u2013 and an ACE2 gene that is similar to the human orthologue. Further characterization of CoVs in pangolins and other animals that may harbour SARS-CoV-like viruses should be a public health priority.Cryptic adaptation to humans. It is also possible that a progenitor to SARS-CoV-2 jumped from a non-human animal to humans, with the genomic features described above acquired through adaptation during subsequent human-to-human transmission. We surmise that once these adaptations were acquired (either together or in series) it would enable the outbreak to take-off, producing a sufficiently large and unusual cluster of pneumonia cases to trigger the surveillance system that ultimately detected it.All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced so far have the well adapted RBD and the polybasic cleavage site, and are thus derived from a common ancestor that had these features. The presence of an RBD in pangolins that is very similar to the one in SARS-CoV-2 means that this was likely already present in the virus that jumped to humans, even if we don\u2019t yet have the exact non-human progenitor virus. This leaves the polybasic cleavage site insertion to occur during human-to-human transmission. Following the example of the influenza A virus HA gene, a specific insertion or recombination event is required to enable the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as an epidemic pathogen.Estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 using currently available genome sequence data point to virus emergence in late November to early December 201920,21, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases22. Hence, this scenario presumes a period of unrecognised transmission in humans between the initial zoonotic transfer event and the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site. Sufficient opportunity could occur if there had been many prior zoonotic events producing short chains of human-to-human transmission (so-called \u2018stuttering chains\u2019) over an extended period. This is essentially the situation for MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula where all the human cases are the result of repeated jumps of the virus from dromedary camels, producing single infections or short chains of transmission that eventually resolve. To date, after 2,499 cases over 8 years, no human adaptation has emerged that has allowed MERS-CoV to take hold in the human population.How could we test whether cryptic spread of SARS-CoV-2 enabled human adaptation?  Metagenomic studies of banked serum samples could provide important information, but given the relatively short period of viremia it may be impossible to detect low level SARS-CoV-2 circulation in historical samples. Retrospective serological studies potentially could be informative and a few such studies have already been conducted. One found that animal importation traders had a 13% seropositivity to coronaviruses23, while another noted that 3% residents of a village in Southern China were seropositive to these viruses24. Interestingly, 200 residents of Wuhan did not show coronavirus seroreactivity. Critically, however, these studies could not have distinguished whether positive serological responses were due to a prior infection with SARS-CoV-1 or -2. Further retrospective serological studies should be conducted to determine the extent of prior human exposure to betacoronaviruses in different geographic areas, particularly using assays that can distinguish among multiple betacoronaviruses.Selection during passage. Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models have been ongoing in BSL-2 for many years in multiple laboratories across the world25-28. There are also documented instances of the laboratory acquisition of SARS-CoV-1 by laboratory personnel working under BSL-2 containment29,30. We must therefore consider the possibility of a deliberate or inadvertent release of SARS-CoV-2. In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired the observed RBD mutations site during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in studies with SARS-CoV5 as well as MERS-CoV31. However, the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site or O-linked glycans - if functional - argues against this scenario. New polybasic cleavage sites have only been observed after prolonged passaging of low pathogenicity avian influenza virus in cell culture or animals. Furthermore, the generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with a very high genetic similarity. Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required an intense program of passage in cell culture or animals with ACE-2 receptor similar to humans (e.g. ferrets). It is also questionable whether generation of the O-linked glycans would have occurred on cell culture passage, as such mutations typically suggest the involvement of an immune system, that is not present  in vitro .In the midst of the global COVID-19 public health emergency it is reasonable to wonder why the origins of the epidemic matter. A detailed understanding of how an animal virus jumped species boundaries to infect humans so productively will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events. For example, if SARS-CoV-2 pre-adapted in another animal species then we are at risk of future re-emergence events even if the current epidemic is controlled. In contrast, if the adaptive process we describe occurred in humans, then even if we have repeated zoonotic transfers they are unlikely to take-off unless the same series of mutations occurs. In addition, identifying the closest animal relatives of SARS-CoV-2 will greatly assist studies of virus function. Indeed, the availability of the RaTG13 bat sequence facilitated the comparative genomic analysis performed here, helping to reveal the key mutations in the RBD as well as the polybasic cleavage site insertion.The genomic features described here may in part explain the infectiousness and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Although genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here, and it is unclear whether future data will help resolve this issue. Identifying the immediate non-human animal source and obtaining virus sequences from it would be the most definitive way of revealing virus origins. In addition, it would be helpful to obtain more genetic and functional data about the virus, including experimental studies of receptor binding and the role of the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans. The identification of a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the sequencing of very early cases including those not connected to the Wuhan market, would similarly be highly informative. Irrespective of how SARS-CoV-2 originated, the ongoing surveillance of pneumonia in humans and other animals is clearly of utmost importance.We thank all those who have contributed SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and contributed analyses and ideas to Virological.org (http://virological.org/).

I would add, however, that even if two virus isolates have an IDENTICAL amino acid sequence, that would not automatically make one the origin of the other. In my post 10 days ago, Tackling Rumors of a Suspicious Origin of nCoV2019 , I showed that mutations in the 3rd wobble base in an otherwise conserved region accumulate as to make seemingly identical viruses very much separated in time \u2013 indeed over decades.It is time to leave playing \u201cwho\u2019s ur daddy\u201d to daytime television.

Andersen\nDepartment of Immunology and Microbiology,\nThe Scripps Research Institute,\nLa Jolla, CA 92037,\nUSA.Since the first reports of a novel pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China there has been considerable discussion and uncertainty over the origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 are now widespread in China, with cases in every province. As of 14 February 2020, 64,473 such cases have been confirmed, with 1,384 deaths attributed to the virus. These official case numbers are likely an underestimate because of limited reporting of mild and asymptomatic cases, and the virus is clearly capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. Based on the possibility of spread to countries with weaker healthcare systems, the World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). There are currently neither vaccines nor specific treatments for this disease.SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the  Coronaviridae  known to infect humans. Three of these viruses, SARS CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, can cause severe disease; four, HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E, are associated with mild respiratory symptoms. Herein, we review what can be deduced about the origin and early evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from the comparative analysis of available genome sequence data. In particular, we offer a perspective on the notable features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and discuss scenarios by which these features could have arisen. Importantly, this analysis provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct nor a purposefully manipulated virus.The genomic comparison of both alpha- and betacoronaviruses (family  Coronaviridae ) described below identifies two notable features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (i) based on structural modelling and early biochemical experiments, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be optimized for binding to the human ACE2 receptor; (ii) the highly variable spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1 and S2 boundary via the insertion of twelve nucleotides. Additionally, this event led to the acquisition of three predicted O-linked glycans around the polybasic cleavage site.The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses is the most variable part of the virus genome. Six residues in the RBD appear to be critical for binding to the human ACE2 receptor and determining host range1. Using coordinates based on the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV, they are Y442, L472, N479, D480, T487, and Y4911. The corresponding residues in SARS-CoV-2 are L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501, and Y505. Five of these six residues are mutated in SARS-CoV-2 compared to its most closely related virus, RaTG13 sampled from a  Rhinolophus affinis  bat, to which it is ~96% identical2 (Figure 1a). Based on modeling1 and biochemical experiments3,4, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have an RBD that may bind with high affinity to ACE2 from human, non-human primate, ferret, pig, and cat, as well as other species with high receptor homology1. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 may bind less efficiently to ACE2 in other species associated with SARS-like viruses, including rodents and civets1.The phenylalanine (F) at residue 486 in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein corresponds to L472 in the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. Notably, in SARS-CoV cell culture experiments the L472 mutates to phenylalanine (L472F)5, which is predicted to be optimal for binding of the SARS-CoV RBD to the human ACE2 receptor6. However, a phenylalanine in this position is also present in several SARS-like CoVs from bats (Figure 1a). While these analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of binding the human ACE2 receptor with high affinity, the interaction is not predicted to be optimal1. Additionally, several of the key residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 are different to those previously described as optimal for human ACE2 receptor binding6. In contrast to these computational predictions, recent binding studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 binds with high affinity to human ACE27. Thus the SARS-CoV-2 spike appears to be the result of selection on human or human-like ACE2 permitting another optimal binding solution to arise. This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is  not  the product of genetic engineering.The second notable feature of SARS-CoV-2 is a predicted polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2, the two subunits of the spike protein (Figure 1b)8,9. In addition to two basic arginines and an alanine at the cleavage site, a leading proline is also inserted; thus, the fully inserted sequence is PRRA (Figure 1b). The strong turn created by the proline insertion is predicted to result in the addition of O-linked glycans to S673, T678, and S686 that flank the polybasic cleavage site. A polybasic cleavage site has not previously been observed in related lineage B betacoronaviruses and is a unique feature of SARS-CoV-2. Some human betacoronaviruses, including HCoV-HKU1 (lineage A), have polybasic cleavage sites, as well as predicted O-linked glycans near the S1/S2 cleavage site.While the functional consequence of the polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, experiments with SARS-CoV have shown that engineering such a site at the S1/S2 junction enhances cell\u2013cell fusion but does not affect virus entry10. Polybasic cleavage sites allow effective cleavage by furin and other proteases, and can be acquired at the junction of the two subunits of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of avian influenza viruses in conditions that select for rapid virus replication and transmission (e.g. highly dense chicken populations). HA serves a similar function in cell-cell fusion and viral entry as the coronavirus S protein. Acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site in HA, by either insertion or recombination, converts low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses into highly pathogenic forms11-13. The acquisition of polybasic cleavage sites by the influenza virus HA has also been observed after repeated forced passage in cell culture or through animals14,15. Similarly, an avirulent isolate of Newcastle Disease virus became highly pathogenic during serial passage in chickens by incremental acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site at the junction of its fusion protein subunits16. The potential function of the three predicted O-linked glycans is less clear, but they could create a \u201cmucin-like domain\u201d that would shield potential epitopes or key residues on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Biochemical analyses or structural studies are required to determine whether or not the predicted O-linked glycan sites are utilized.figure2718\u00d71487 394 KBFigure 1. (a) Mutations in contact residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (top) was aligned against the most closely related SARS-like CoVs and SARS-CoV-1. Key residues in the spike protein that make contact to the ACE2 receptor are marked with blue boxes in both SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. ( b) Acquisition of polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans.  The polybasic cleavage site is marked in grey with the three adjacent predicted O-linked glycans in blue. Both the polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and not previously seen in lineage B betacoronaviruses. Sequences shown are from NCBI GenBank, accession numbers MN908947, MN996532, AY278741, KY417146, MK211376. The pangolin coronavirus sequences are a consensus generated from SRR10168377 and SRR10168378 (NCBI BioProject PRJNA573298)18,19.It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of an existing SARS-related coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for human ACE2 receptor binding with an efficient binding solution different to that which would have been predicted. Further, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one would expect that one of the several reverse genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would have been used. However, this is not the case as the genetic data shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone17. Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in a non-human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage in culture could have given rise to the same observed features.Selection in an animal host. As many of the early cases of COVID-19 were linked to the Huanan seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, it is possible that an animal source was present at this location. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, particularly RaTG13, it is plausible that bats serve as reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2. It is important, however, to note that previous outbreaks of betacoronaviruses in humans involved direct exposure to animals other than bats, including civets (SARS) and camels (MERS), that carry viruses that are genetically very similar to SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, respectively. By analogy, viruses closely related to SARS-Cov-2 may be circulating in one or more animal species. Initial analyses indicate that Malayan pangolins ( Manis javanica ) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain a CoV that is similar to SARS-CoV-218,19. Although the bat virus RaTG13 remains the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 across the whole genome, the Malayan pangolin CoV is identical to SARS-CoV-2 at all six key RBD residues (Figure 1). However, no pangolin CoV has yet been identified that is sufficiently similar to SARS-CoV-2 across its entire genome to support direct human infection. In addition, the pangolin CoV does not carry a polybasic cleavage site insertion. For a precursor virus to acquire the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the spike protein suitable for human ACE2 receptor binding, an animal host would likely have to have a high population density \u2013 to allow natural selection to proceed efficiently \u2013 and an ACE2 gene that is similar to the human orthologue. Further characterization of CoVs in pangolins and other animals that may harbour SARS-CoV-like viruses should be a public health priority.Cryptic adaptation to humans. It is also possible that a progenitor to SARS-CoV-2 jumped from a non-human animal to humans, with the genomic features described above acquired through adaptation during subsequent human-to-human transmission. We surmise that once these adaptations were acquired (either together or in series) it would enable the outbreak to take-off, producing a sufficiently large and unusual cluster of pneumonia cases to trigger the surveillance system that ultimately detected it.All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced so far have the well adapted RBD and the polybasic cleavage site, and are thus derived from a common ancestor that had these features. The presence of an RBD in pangolins that is very similar to the one in SARS-CoV-2 means that this was likely already present in the virus that jumped to humans, even if we don\u2019t yet have the exact non-human progenitor virus. This leaves the polybasic cleavage site insertion to occur during human-to-human transmission. Following the example of the influenza A virus HA gene, a specific insertion or recombination event is required to enable the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as an epidemic pathogen.Estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 using currently available genome sequence data point to virus emergence in late November to early December 201920,21, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases22. Hence, this scenario presumes a period of unrecognised transmission in humans between the initial zoonotic transfer event and the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site. Sufficient opportunity could occur if there had been many prior zoonotic events producing short chains of human-to-human transmission (so-called \u2018stuttering chains\u2019) over an extended period. This is essentially the situation for MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula where all the human cases are the result of repeated jumps of the virus from dromedary camels, producing single infections or short chains of transmission that eventually resolve. To date, after 2,499 cases over 8 years, no human adaptation has emerged that has allowed MERS-CoV to take hold in the human population.How could we test whether cryptic spread of SARS-CoV-2 enabled human adaptation?  Metagenomic studies of banked serum samples could provide important information, but given the relatively short period of viremia it may be impossible to detect low level SARS-CoV-2 circulation in historical samples. Retrospective serological studies potentially could be informative and a few such studies have already been conducted. One found that animal importation traders had a 13% seropositivity to coronaviruses23, while another noted that 3% residents of a village in Southern China were seropositive to these viruses24. Interestingly, 200 residents of Wuhan did not show coronavirus seroreactivity. Critically, however, these studies could not have distinguished whether positive serological responses were due to a prior infection with SARS-CoV-1 or -2. Further retrospective serological studies should be conducted to determine the extent of prior human exposure to betacoronaviruses in different geographic areas, particularly using assays that can distinguish among multiple betacoronaviruses.Selection during passage. Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models have been ongoing in BSL-2 for many years in multiple laboratories across the world25-28. There are also documented instances of the laboratory acquisition of SARS-CoV-1 by laboratory personnel working under BSL-2 containment29,30. We must therefore consider the possibility of a deliberate or inadvertent release of SARS-CoV-2. In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired the observed RBD mutations site during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in studies with SARS-CoV5 as well as MERS-CoV31. However, the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site or O-linked glycans - if functional - argues against this scenario. New polybasic cleavage sites have only been observed after prolonged passaging of low pathogenicity avian influenza virus in cell culture or animals. Furthermore, the generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with a very high genetic similarity. Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required an intense program of passage in cell culture or animals with ACE-2 receptor similar to humans (e.g. ferrets). It is also questionable whether generation of the O-linked glycans would have occurred on cell culture passage, as such mutations typically suggest the involvement of an immune system, that is not present  in vitro .In the midst of the global COVID-19 public health emergency it is reasonable to wonder why the origins of the epidemic matter. A detailed understanding of how an animal virus jumped species boundaries to infect humans so productively will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events. For example, if SARS-CoV-2 pre-adapted in another animal species then we are at risk of future re-emergence events even if the current epidemic is controlled. In contrast, if the adaptive process we describe occurred in humans, then even if we have repeated zoonotic transfers they are unlikely to take-off unless the same series of mutations occurs. In addition, identifying the closest animal relatives of SARS-CoV-2 will greatly assist studies of virus function. Indeed, the availability of the RaTG13 bat sequence facilitated the comparative genomic analysis performed here, helping to reveal the key mutations in the RBD as well as the polybasic cleavage site insertion.The genomic features described here may in part explain the infectiousness and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Although genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here, and it is unclear whether future data will help resolve this issue. Identifying the immediate non-human animal source and obtaining virus sequences from it would be the most definitive way of revealing virus origins. In addition, it would be helpful to obtain more genetic and functional data about the virus, including experimental studies of receptor binding and the role of the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans. The identification of a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the sequencing of very early cases including those not connected to the Wuhan market, would similarly be highly informative. Irrespective of how SARS-CoV-2 originated, the ongoing surveillance of pneumonia in humans and other animals is clearly of utmost importance.We thank all those who have contributed SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and contributed analyses and ideas to Virological.org (http://virological.org/).

I would add, however, that even if two virus isolates have an IDENTICAL amino acid sequence, that would not automatically make one the origin of the other. In my post 10 days ago, Tackling Rumors of a Suspicious Origin of nCoV2019 , I showed that mutations in the 3rd wobble base in an otherwise conserved region accumulate as to make seemingly identical viruses very much separated in time \u2013 indeed over decades.It is time to leave playing \u201cwho\u2019s ur daddy\u201d to daytime television. No known viral RNA sequence is the daddy of SARS-CoV-2. No match. If it doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit. It is all bat guano. Whatever analogy you like. A thrust of distrust and recrimination is not the path to protecting the planet from a viral catastrophe.Bill GallaherMandarin translation thanks to CHEN Guo from the Center for Infection and Immunity in the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health.The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2_ChineseSummary.pdf (198.5 KB)Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled",

Andersen\nDepartment of Immunology and Microbiology,\nThe Scripps Research Institute,\nLa Jolla, CA 92037,\nUSA.Since the first reports of a novel pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China there has been considerable discussion and uncertainty over the origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 are now widespread in China, with cases in every province. As of 14 February 2020, 64,473 such cases have been confirmed, with 1,384 deaths attributed to the virus. These official case numbers are likely an underestimate because of limited reporting of mild and asymptomatic cases, and the virus is clearly capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. Based on the possibility of spread to countries with weaker healthcare systems, the World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). There are currently neither vaccines nor specific treatments for this disease.SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the  Coronaviridae  known to infect humans. Three of these viruses, SARS CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, can cause severe disease; four, HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E, are associated with mild respiratory symptoms. Herein, we review what can be deduced about the origin and early evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from the comparative analysis of available genome sequence data. In particular, we offer a perspective on the notable features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and discuss scenarios by which these features could have arisen. Importantly, this analysis provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct nor a purposefully manipulated virus.The genomic comparison of both alpha- and betacoronaviruses (family  Coronaviridae ) described below identifies two notable features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (i) based on structural modelling and early biochemical experiments, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be optimized for binding to the human ACE2 receptor; (ii) the highly variable spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1 and S2 boundary via the insertion of twelve nucleotides. Additionally, this event led to the acquisition of three predicted O-linked glycans around the polybasic cleavage site.The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses is the most variable part of the virus genome. Six residues in the RBD appear to be critical for binding to the human ACE2 receptor and determining host range1. Using coordinates based on the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV, they are Y442, L472, N479, D480, T487, and Y4911. The corresponding residues in SARS-CoV-2 are L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501, and Y505. Five of these six residues are mutated in SARS-CoV-2 compared to its most closely related virus, RaTG13 sampled from a  Rhinolophus affinis  bat, to which it is ~96% identical2 (Figure 1a). Based on modeling1 and biochemical experiments3,4, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have an RBD that may bind with high affinity to ACE2 from human, non-human primate, ferret, pig, and cat, as well as other species with high receptor homology1. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 may bind less efficiently to ACE2 in other species associated with SARS-like viruses, including rodents and civets1.The phenylalanine (F) at residue 486 in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein corresponds to L472 in the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. Notably, in SARS-CoV cell culture experiments the L472 mutates to phenylalanine (L472F)5, which is predicted to be optimal for binding of the SARS-CoV RBD to the human ACE2 receptor6. However, a phenylalanine in this position is also present in several SARS-like CoVs from bats (Figure 1a). While these analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of binding the human ACE2 receptor with high affinity, the interaction is not predicted to be optimal1. Additionally, several of the key residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 are different to those previously described as optimal for human ACE2 receptor binding6. In contrast to these computational predictions, recent binding studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 binds with high affinity to human ACE27. Thus the SARS-CoV-2 spike appears to be the result of selection on human or human-like ACE2 permitting another optimal binding solution to arise. This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is  not  the product of genetic engineering.The second notable feature of SARS-CoV-2 is a predicted polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2, the two subunits of the spike protein (Figure 1b)8,9. In addition to two basic arginines and an alanine at the cleavage site, a leading proline is also inserted; thus, the fully inserted sequence is PRRA (Figure 1b). The strong turn created by the proline insertion is predicted to result in the addition of O-linked glycans to S673, T678, and S686 that flank the polybasic cleavage site. A polybasic cleavage site has not previously been observed in related lineage B betacoronaviruses and is a unique feature of SARS-CoV-2. Some human betacoronaviruses, including HCoV-HKU1 (lineage A), have polybasic cleavage sites, as well as predicted O-linked glycans near the S1/S2 cleavage site.While the functional consequence of the polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, experiments with SARS-CoV have shown that engineering such a site at the S1/S2 junction enhances cell\u2013cell fusion but does not affect virus entry10. Polybasic cleavage sites allow effective cleavage by furin and other proteases, and can be acquired at the junction of the two subunits of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of avian influenza viruses in conditions that select for rapid virus replication and transmission (e.g. highly dense chicken populations). HA serves a similar function in cell-cell fusion and viral entry as the coronavirus S protein. Acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site in HA, by either insertion or recombination, converts low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses into highly pathogenic forms11-13. The acquisition of polybasic cleavage sites by the influenza virus HA has also been observed after repeated forced passage in cell culture or through animals14,15. Similarly, an avirulent isolate of Newcastle Disease virus became highly pathogenic during serial passage in chickens by incremental acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site at the junction of its fusion protein subunits16. The potential function of the three predicted O-linked glycans is less clear, but they could create a \u201cmucin-like domain\u201d that would shield potential epitopes or key residues on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Biochemical analyses or structural studies are required to determine whether or not the predicted O-linked glycan sites are utilized.figure2718\u00d71487 394 KBFigure 1. (a) Mutations in contact residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (top) was aligned against the most closely related SARS-like CoVs and SARS-CoV-1. Key residues in the spike protein that make contact to the ACE2 receptor are marked with blue boxes in both SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. ( b) Acquisition of polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans.  The polybasic cleavage site is marked in grey with the three adjacent predicted O-linked glycans in blue. Both the polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and not previously seen in lineage B betacoronaviruses. Sequences shown are from NCBI GenBank, accession numbers MN908947, MN996532, AY278741, KY417146, MK211376. The pangolin coronavirus sequences are a consensus generated from SRR10168377 and SRR10168378 (NCBI BioProject PRJNA573298)18,19.It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of an existing SARS-related coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for human ACE2 receptor binding with an efficient binding solution different to that which would have been predicted. Further, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one would expect that one of the several reverse genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would have been used. However, this is not the case as the genetic data shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone17. Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in a non-human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage in culture could have given rise to the same observed features.Selection in an animal host. As many of the early cases of COVID-19 were linked to the Huanan seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, it is possible that an animal source was present at this location. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, particularly RaTG13, it is plausible that bats serve as reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2. It is important, however, to note that previous outbreaks of betacoronaviruses in humans involved direct exposure to animals other than bats, including civets (SARS) and camels (MERS), that carry viruses that are genetically very similar to SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, respectively. By analogy, viruses closely related to SARS-Cov-2 may be circulating in one or more animal species. Initial analyses indicate that Malayan pangolins ( Manis javanica ) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain a CoV that is similar to SARS-CoV-218,19. Although the bat virus RaTG13 remains the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 across the whole genome, the Malayan pangolin CoV is identical to SARS-CoV-2 at all six key RBD residues (Figure 1). However, no pangolin CoV has yet been identified that is sufficiently similar to SARS-CoV-2 across its entire genome to support direct human infection. In addition, the pangolin CoV does not carry a polybasic cleavage site insertion. For a precursor virus to acquire the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the spike protein suitable for human ACE2 receptor binding, an animal host would likely have to have a high population density \u2013 to allow natural selection to proceed efficiently \u2013 and an ACE2 gene that is similar to the human orthologue. Further characterization of CoVs in pangolins and other animals that may harbour SARS-CoV-like viruses should be a public health priority.Cryptic adaptation to humans. It is also possible that a progenitor to SARS-CoV-2 jumped from a non-human animal to humans, with the genomic features described above acquired through adaptation during subsequent human-to-human transmission. We surmise that once these adaptations were acquired (either together or in series) it would enable the outbreak to take-off, producing a sufficiently large and unusual cluster of pneumonia cases to trigger the surveillance system that ultimately detected it.All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced so far have the well adapted RBD and the polybasic cleavage site, and are thus derived from a common ancestor that had these features. The presence of an RBD in pangolins that is very similar to the one in SARS-CoV-2 means that this was likely already present in the virus that jumped to humans, even if we don\u2019t yet have the exact non-human progenitor virus. This leaves the polybasic cleavage site insertion to occur during human-to-human transmission. Following the example of the influenza A virus HA gene, a specific insertion or recombination event is required to enable the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as an epidemic pathogen.Estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 using currently available genome sequence data point to virus emergence in late November to early December 201920,21, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases22. Hence, this scenario presumes a period of unrecognised transmission in humans between the initial zoonotic transfer event and the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site. Sufficient opportunity could occur if there had been many prior zoonotic events producing short chains of human-to-human transmission (so-called \u2018stuttering chains\u2019) over an extended period. This is essentially the situation for MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula where all the human cases are the result of repeated jumps of the virus from dromedary camels, producing single infections or short chains of transmission that eventually resolve. To date, after 2,499 cases over 8 years, no human adaptation has emerged that has allowed MERS-CoV to take hold in the human population.How could we test whether cryptic spread of SARS-CoV-2 enabled human adaptation?  Metagenomic studies of banked serum samples could provide important information, but given the relatively short period of viremia it may be impossible to detect low level SARS-CoV-2 circulation in historical samples. Retrospective serological studies potentially could be informative and a few such studies have already been conducted. One found that animal importation traders had a 13% seropositivity to coronaviruses23, while another noted that 3% residents of a village in Southern China were seropositive to these viruses24. Interestingly, 200 residents of Wuhan did not show coronavirus seroreactivity. Critically, however, these studies could not have distinguished whether positive serological responses were due to a prior infection with SARS-CoV-1 or -2. Further retrospective serological studies should be conducted to determine the extent of prior human exposure to betacoronaviruses in different geographic areas, particularly using assays that can distinguish among multiple betacoronaviruses.Selection during passage. Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models have been ongoing in BSL-2 for many years in multiple laboratories across the world25-28. There are also documented instances of the laboratory acquisition of SARS-CoV-1 by laboratory personnel working under BSL-2 containment29,30. We must therefore consider the possibility of a deliberate or inadvertent release of SARS-CoV-2. In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired the observed RBD mutations site during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in studies with SARS-CoV5 as well as MERS-CoV31. However, the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site or O-linked glycans - if functional - argues against this scenario. New polybasic cleavage sites have only been observed after prolonged passaging of low pathogenicity avian influenza virus in cell culture or animals. Furthermore, the generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with a very high genetic similarity. Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required an intense program of passage in cell culture or animals with ACE-2 receptor similar to humans (e.g. ferrets). It is also questionable whether generation of the O-linked glycans would have occurred on cell culture passage, as such mutations typically suggest the involvement of an immune system, that is not present  in vitro .In the midst of the global COVID-19 public health emergency it is reasonable to wonder why the origins of the epidemic matter. A detailed understanding of how an animal virus jumped species boundaries to infect humans so productively will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events. For example, if SARS-CoV-2 pre-adapted in another animal species then we are at risk of future re-emergence events even if the current epidemic is controlled. In contrast, if the adaptive process we describe occurred in humans, then even if we have repeated zoonotic transfers they are unlikely to take-off unless the same series of mutations occurs. In addition, identifying the closest animal relatives of SARS-CoV-2 will greatly assist studies of virus function. Indeed, the availability of the RaTG13 bat sequence facilitated the comparative genomic analysis performed here, helping to reveal the key mutations in the RBD as well as the polybasic cleavage site insertion.The genomic features described here may in part explain the infectiousness and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Although genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here, and it is unclear whether future data will help resolve this issue. Identifying the immediate non-human animal source and obtaining virus sequences from it would be the most definitive way of revealing virus origins. In addition, it would be helpful to obtain more genetic and functional data about the virus, including experimental studies of receptor binding and the role of the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans. The identification of a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the sequencing of very early cases including those not connected to the Wuhan market, would similarly be highly informative. Irrespective of how SARS-CoV-2 originated, the ongoing surveillance of pneumonia in humans and other animals is clearly of utmost importance.We thank all those who have contributed SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and contributed analyses and ideas to Virological.org (http://virological.org/).

I would add, however, that even if two virus isolates have an IDENTICAL amino acid sequence, that would not automatically make one the origin of the other. In my post 10 days ago, Tackling Rumors of a Suspicious Origin of nCoV2019 , I showed that mutations in the 3rd wobble base in an otherwise conserved region accumulate as to make seemingly identical viruses very much separated in time \u2013 indeed over decades.It is time to leave playing \u201cwho\u2019s ur daddy\u201d to daytime television. No known viral RNA sequence is the daddy of SARS-CoV-2. No match. If it doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit. It is all bat guano. Whatever analogy you like. A thrust of distrust and recrimination is not the path to protecting the planet from a viral catastrophe.Bill GallaherMandarin translation thanks to CHEN Guo from the Center for Infection and Immunity in the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health.The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2_ChineseSummary.pdf (198.5 KB)Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled",

            "headline": "Early epidemiological assessment of the transmission potential and virulence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City: China, January-February, 2020",
            "main_text": "Background: \nSince the first cluster of cases was identified in Wuhan City, China, in December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across China, causing multiple introductions in 109 countries/territories/areas as of March 10th. Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently more evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of this emerging disease. In this study, we derive estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources.\nMethods: \nWe employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For this purpose, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were integrated into our analysis.\nResults: \nOur posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China in 2019-2020 reached values as high as 5.20 (95%CrI: 5.04-5.47) and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23rd in 2020 was associated with a declined R at 0.58 (95%CrI: 0.51-0.64), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 1905526 (95%CrI: 1350283-2655936) in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 19.1% (95%CrI: 13.5-26.6%). We also found that most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be 0.04% (95% CrI: 0.03-0.06%) and 0.12% (95%CrI: 0.08-0.17%), which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR estimated at 4.19%\nConclusions: \nWe have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China during January-February, 2020 using an ecological modelling approach. The power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems.The authors have declared no competing interest.KM acknowledges support from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grant Number 18K17368 and from the Leading Initiative for Excellent Young Researchers from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science & Technology of Japan.

The examination dates will also be adjusted accordingly.As of February 15, all 63 provinces and cities in Vietnam have extended their school closing time, 56 of which \u2014 including Saigon \u2014 have announced that schools will be closed until the end of February, according to the news source.Amidst the worrying spread of Covid-19, the Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s People Committee is also proposing to the central government and the education and training ministry to let students stay at home until the end of March. The proposed second term of the academic year will then start instead in April and end in July this year. The new academic term will start in September and the summer holiday will be shortened to one month.The HCMC Department of Education and Training has also sent a dispatch encouraging schools and universities to change their teaching methods to ones that stimulate self-learning and research.While most schools and parents agree on closing schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic, long breaks have taken a toll on parents, especially factory workers who have small children. Tuoi Tre mentioned in a different report that since these workers still have to go to work, a lot of them are struggling to find babysitting help.[Photo: Staff members of a school in Hanoi clean campus facilities during the extended break/Facebook page Truong Nguyen Sieu]Saigoneer in Health\n\n1 MONTH AGOVietnam experienced a dramatic weekend related to the coronavirus spreading out of Wuhan, China.Saigoneer in Health\n\n2 DAYS AGONine new coronavirus cases in Vietnam have been confirmed within the last three days.Saigoneer in Vietnam\n\n20 DAYS AGOSouth Korea is in the midst of a rapid surge of Covid-19 cases, and now has the most confirmed infections outside of China: 763 cases and seven deaths at the time of writing.Saigoneer in Health\n\n6 MONTHS AGOThe oft-debated new draft Law on Preventing Alcohol's Harmful Effects has seen new proposals from the Ministry of Health.Saigoneer in Health\n\n10 MONTHS AGOIn 2018, Vietnam's total beer consumption reached over 4.67 billion liters, according to Nielsen statistics.Saigoneer in Travel\n\n16 DAYS AGOThe campaigns are the effort to compensate for the losses in tourism revenue due to the Covid-19 epidemic.",

            "main_text": "Summary:Death toll passes 2,000 as Hubei reports 132 deaths for TuesdayJapan to release first wave of 500 passengers + crew at 10:30 am in TokyoFlorida health officials mysteriously refuse to share virus info with reportersRussia bars all Chinese from enteringNYT notes signs of impending economic distressSouth Korea announces \"emergency steps\" to prepare for outbreak.South Korea announces 15 new cases* * *Update (1940ET): It's Wednesday morning in Yokohama. So you know what that means.Japanese health authorities are beginning the process of offloading the remaining 2,000+ passengers and crew aboard the 'Diamond Princess', a ship that has been under quarantine for 14 days.The offloading will take place in phases over three days, finally wrapping up on Friday. The first 500 people are set to leave at around 10:30 am Tokyo time on Wednesday. There will be no preference given to different nationalities, according to Japan's Ministry of Health.Many who depart will be subject to another 14 days of quarantine, including any Americans who elected to stay on the ship instead of traveling back to the US on the evac flight. Roughly 40 Americans were also excluded from that flight because they were being treated for the virus in a Japanese hospital.So far, 542 people - including at least 14 of the 300 or so Americans who traveled back to the US on Monday in Japan - have tested positive for the virus. And while Japan says it has tested everybody aboard, doctors and experts say there's no way to certain that people being released won't be carrying the virus - hence the quarantines when they return home.But where will they go between now and then? And with no immediate after-care plans - at least none that have been publicly disclosed, it looks like Japan is about to set thousands of people aboard the most infected environment outside China loose in Tokyo.Of course, Japanese authorities are so paranoid about the Olympics, one would think they would be doing everything in their power to stop an outbreak in Tokyo, especially at such a sensitive time.About 500 people are set to leave the ship from around 10:30 a.m. Tokyo time on Wednesday, with no preference given to any particular nationality, Japan\u2019s Health Ministry said.Hopefully, health officials will manage to convince the world that they successfully screened for the virus.The ship was first quarantined on Feb. 5 more than a week after a man who tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong disembarked. Journalists have shared stories of desperation and paranoia from those trapped on the ship, making it sound like such a nightmare that many who read those stories may never want to travel on a cruise.In other news, Yonhap reported minutes ago that South Korea has another 15 cases, increasing the countries total by roughly one-third to 46 one day after the country's president warned of an \"economic emergency\" as companies like Hyundai suffer from supply shortages from China. The South Korean government has already announced a fiscal stimulus package to help companies hurt by the virus.* * *Update (1720ET): Health officials in Hubei reported a big jump in deaths on Tuesday, shattering the state's narrative that the virus is being beaten because the number of confirmed cases and deaths were falling.And with the new figures, the China death toll has hit 2,000 exactly, up from 1,868 deaths as of the end of Monday, according to China's NHC.Meanwhile, state officials in Florida are refusing to release any information about the state's efforts to contain a coronavirus outbreak, including data about the number of patients who have been tested for the virus, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\"The goal of this public health response is containment,\" said state Surgeon General Scott Rivkees, who presented to the Senate Health Policy committee Tuesday. \"And if there\u2019s a confirmed case, it will absolutely be reported.\"Rivkees added that the state wasn't allowed to release the information because of \"privacy concerns\" - likely a rule about patient confidentiality codified in the federal HIPPA guidelines.However, veteran journalists in the state pressed the surgeon general: These numbers were shared with the public during Zika, and since the numbers don't include any personalized details, there shouldn't be any conflict with HIPPA.Despite their protests, the state simply deferred to the Department of Health, which has created a 700-person incident management team to liaise with states and help the country prepare for the potential outbreak. Certain protocols have been shared with officials in every state.Though if not sharing this information is part of some kind of federal 'protocol', then how come Washington State is sharing some of this information directly on a Department of Public Health website?Also in the US: the CDC said earlier that the State Department is planning to bar any Americans who were aboard the Diamond Princess but didn't return with the evacuees from returning to the country until next month.* * *Update (1600ET): Writing in the latest update to its coronavirus live blog, the New York Times points out that more signs of economic pain from the outbreak have emerged on Tuesday. It cites HSBC's bloodletting, Jaguar's warning about looming production problems and Apple's latest production warning as worrying signs of corporate blowback even as the Nasdaq closed at a record high.Economic fallout from the new coronavirus epidemic continued to spread on Tuesday, with new evidence emerging in manufacturing, financial markets, commodities, banking and other sectors.HSBC, one of the most important banks in Hong Kong, said it plans to cut 35,000 jobs and $4.5 billion in costs as it faces headwinds that include the coronavirus outbreak and months of political strife in Hong Kong. The bank, based in London, had come to depend increasingly on China for growth.Jaguar Land Rover warned that the coronavirus could soon begin to create production problems at its assembly plants in Britain. Like many carmakers, Jaguar Land Rover uses parts made in China, where many factories have shut down or slowed production; Fiat Chrysler, Renault and Hyundai have already reported interruptions as a result.U.S. stocks declined on Tuesday, a day after Apple warned that it would miss its sales forecasts due to disruption in China, as concerns about the impact of the outbreak weighed on the outlook for the global economy.Stocks tied to the near-term ups and downs of the economy slumped, with energy, financials and industrial shares the leading losers. The S&P 500 index was down 0.5 percent at midafternoon in New York trading.Bond yields declined, with the 10-year Treasury note yielding 1.55 percent, suggesting\u00a0 investors are lowering their expectations for economic growth and inflation. With much of the Chinese economy stalled, demand for oil has fallen and prices were down on Tuesday, with a barrel of West Texas Intermediate selling for roughly $52.In Germany, where the economy depends heavily on global demand for machinery and automobiles, a key indicator showed economic sentiment has tumbled this month, as the economic outlook has weakened.You know it's bad when CNBC's unspoken economics 'Word of the Day' is 'one-off'.Meanwhile, America's 'paper of record' reported that at least 150 million people in China are living under severe lockdown restrictions confining them largely to their homes. That's one-tenth of China's population, and 1% of the global population.Kind of hard to work and consume when you can't leave the house.* * *Update (1410ET): In an interview with Fox News, the CDC's Dr. Anthony Fauci said the risk to Americans of contracting COVID-19 is relatively low right now, but that \"could change\" given the chaotic and unpredictable situation.\"The risk clearly is relatively low right now, but that could change. So we're telling our American citizens to not be fearful, to not be afraid, but to keep an eye on it.\"Dr. Fauci added that the federal government has quarantined every known case of the virus.\"The people in this country that were aware of being infected they've been contacted, isolated and made aware that this is the case.\"Just in case any get through, the US is starting 'sentinel surveillance' of patients around the country who go to the hospital to report flu-like symptoms, as we reported yesterday.\"That will give us a better idea of whether there are any cases that we haven't identified or noticed,\" the doctor added.Watch the clip below:THE HEADLINER: Dr. Anthony Fauci discusses the latest in the coronavirus outbreak #nine2noon pic.twitter.com/BLePf1Olyw* * *Update (1300ET): In a landmark decision, Russia has temporarily banned Chinese from entry as of Feb. 20, becoming the first country to ban all Chinese from entry in response to the coronavirus outbreak, according to Russian news agency TASS.This is only the latest step from Russia, which has already closed most entry points along its 4,200-kilometer border, suspended e-visas and work visas for Chinese nationals.Russia has already reported two cases of coronavirus - the only cases confirmed in the country so far - both involving Chinese nationals.Though there haven't been many cases, there have been a number of interesting virus-related headlines out of Russia in recent weeks. Two men in the city of Chelyabinsk were fined for hooliganism after they filmed a prank video where they pretended to shoot a man infected with the virus in a park. The men wore white hazmat suits and face masks while simulating the shooting of the third person, who wasn't actually infected.\u2014 Russia discharged a Chinese national from the hospital in the Siberian city of Chita on Wednesday after he recovered from a coronavirus infection, the second of Russia's two confirmed cases of coronavirus to recover. The other victim, also a Chinese national, was also said by authorities to have recovered and been released from quarantine in Siberia's Tyumen region.Meanwhile,apropos of nothing, BNO News shared one of the latest videos out of Hubei Province, which we'd like to now share with you.Video from Hubei province shows doctors running across the street to take patients who are critically ill with coronavirus to a new ICU unit. It took 30 minutes per patient, 10 in total - Xinhua pic.twitter.com/16XLrYzB8lThis could be an Olympic Sport (if they don't cancel the Olympics, that is).As a handful of brave foreign correspondents continue to report on the outbreak inside mainland China, the Epoch Times' reporter Jennifer Zeng revealed on Tuesday that 71 people from one workplace in Beijing have been placed under quarantine after one employee was infected by COVID-19.We're glad to see China's shift back to work is going so well.* * *Update (0840ET): Global Times editor Hu Xijin, a government mouthpiece whose tweets were closely followed during the 'Phase 1' trade-deal negotiations, is touting China's dubious data as a sign that the Communist Party is winning the 'People's War' against COVID-19.Daily new infection cases outside Hubei fell below 100 for the first time according to data released on Tuesday. We are on the way to the victory. People are in a better mood and cities are recovering the vitality. I myself is also very happy. pic.twitter.com/nTlxIhOwF4* * *Last night, the western press exposed the Americans for breaking Japan's quarantine on the 'Diamond Princess' by ferrying some 14 infected individuals to the US. But with one day left to go before the Japanese government ends its quarantine and releases thousands of terrified and paranoid passengers into the streets of Tokyo.On Tuesday, another 88 passengers from the Diamond Princess were diagnosed with the virus, bringing the total to 542.#BREAKING: Another 88 confirmed new #coronavirus cases from on board the Diamond Princess @abcnews pic.twitter.com/Ixp1XdpY0xJapan has completed tests for all passengers and crew aboard the ship as of Monday, but the results for the last batch of tests aren't expected until Wednesday, the day that the quarantine is slated to end. So far, results are back for 2,404 passengers and crew, out of the 3,711 who were\u00a0 on board the ship when the quarantine began on Feb. 5.Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said Tuesday that people who have tested negative for the virus would start leaving on Wednesday, but that the process of releasing passengers and crew won't be finished until Friday, according to the Washington Post.The remaining 61 American passengers on the DP who opted not to join the evacuation will not be allowed to return to the US until March 4, according to the American embassy in Tokyo. The governments of Australia, Hong Kong and Canada have also said they would evacuate passengers.Elsewhere, Japan confirmed three more cases of the virus. This time, they were confirmed in Wakayama, a prefecture in eastern Japan.In the latest indication that the 14-day quarantine simply wasn't enough to kill the virus, a British couple has tested positive for the virus just one day before Japanese authorities are set to release everybody from quarantine, according to the Guardian.\"David and Sally Abel, a British couple onboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan, have tested positive for coronavirus, a day before passengers who tested negative were due to start leaving the ship after spending two weeks in quarantine.\"Including all of the cases announced overnight, there are now 73,336 confirmed cases of the virus worldwide, compared with 1,874 deaths.Johns HopkinsAs the battle against the virus rages in Wuhan, Liu Zhiming, 51, a neurosurgeon and the director of the Wuchang Hospital in Wuhan, became the latest high-profile medical worker to succumb to the virus, as we noted last night. Late last week, China confirmed that nearly 2,000 medical workers had been infected.The Commission overseeing China's virus response has released a statement commemorating Liu's life and honoring his death.\"From the start of the outbreak, Comrade Liu Zhiming, without regard to his personal safety, led the medical staff of Wuchang Hospital at the front lines of the fight against the epidemic,\" the commission said. Dr. Liu \"made significant contributions to our city\u2019s fight to prevent and control the novel coronavirus,\" it added.In Beijing, senior officials including President Xi continued to play down the economic blowback from the virus. During remarks on Tuesday, Xi insisted that China could still meet its 2020 economic targets - which called for a doubling of the size of the Chinese economy in 10 years - despite the outbreak.We cross live to the Chinese Statistics Bureau as President Xi says China can still meet 2020 economic targets despite coronavirus pic.twitter.com/JJeqvbWJCZOf course, China' goalseeked economic data has never offered a truly accurate reflection of the world's second-largest economy. And a report by PitchBook warns that Chinese startups are struggling to raise money as the epidemic complicates deal talks an deals a serious blow to the country's 'venture capital' scene.From the start of the year through Feb. 12, venture capital activity in China fell from 381 to 137 deals, and the capital raised declined from $4.05 billion to $1.37 billion, compared to the same period last year.Prior outbreaks like SARS and swine flu also weighed on investment activity.Moving south to Seoul, South Korean President Moon Jae-in called for South Korea to take \"emergency steps\" to prepare for a more widespread outbreak of COVID-19.In contrast to Xi, Moon warned the coronavirus could have a \"bigger and longer-lasting impact\" on his country's economy than the 2015 MERS outbreak, which prompted South Korea to roll out a supplemental budget while the central bank cut rates, WaPo reports. Speculators are now betting on a rate cut at the Bank of Korea's meeting next week. Singapore also announced on Tuesday that it had earmarked $2.8 billion for virus relief measures to help stabilize its economy and assist workers.Over in the Philippines, 25,000 stranded workers can now return to work.French Health Minister Olivier Veran said Tuesday there was a \"credible risk\" that the virus could transform into a pandemic, Reuters reports.\"This is both a working assumption and a credible risk,\" Veran told France Info radio, when asked about the possibility of the coronavirus spreading globally.Taking a brief break from the news, our disturbing video of the day comes from Xinjiang, the far-flung province that's home to millions of Uyghur Muslims.In this video, shared by the Epoch Times' Jennifer Zeng, a police officer suddenly collapses while walking. His current status is unknown.Zhou Shunxin, a police officer in #Xinjiang, suddenly collaspes while walking. Officail report says vaguely that he \"passed out\" at the frone line of #COVID2019 control, and sent to the hospital, but doesn't talke about why he collasped or his current status. #Coronavirus pic.twitter.com/CYfUi259PtOffering a lesson in contrasts, the Global Times, a mainland tabloid, has continued to tweet lighthearted human interest stories from the heart of the outbreak. Today's story: A health-care worker getting married in the heart of the outbreak.Wedding dress, bridal veil and confetti made from a hospital bedsheet with a rubber glove bridal bouquet. Watch this medical staff member's wedding in the battleground against the novel #coronavirus in #Wuhan. https://t.co/GwDguZKfe0 pic.twitter.com/BZt3KprGAIThe GT also reported that officials in Hubei are continuing with a \"comprehensive search\" for patients with fevers, and have even started tracking down every individual who has purchased fever or cough medicine since Jan. 20.Central China\u2019s Hubei Province, where epicenter #Wuhan is located, launched a comprehensive search of fever patients on Tuesday. Authorities are tracking down people with symptoms of fever or those who bought fever and cough medicines since January 20. #COVID2019 #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/6hwEYzymtMAs we reported last night, Apple published a press release admitting it \"does not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided for the March quarter\" due to coronavirus-related issues.Since we haven't reported a full breakdown of cases in a while, here's a complete list and breakdown of infections by country and territory, courtesy of the AP:Mainland China: 1,868 deaths among 72,436 cases, chiefly in Hubei\nHong Kong: 58 cases, 1 death\nMacao: 10\nJapan: 607 cases, including 542 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, 1 death\nSingapore: 77 cases\nThailand: 35\nSouth Korea: 31\nMalaysia: 22\nTaiwan: 22 cases, 1 death\nVietnam: 16 cases\nGermany: 16\nUnited States: 15 cases; separately, 1 US citizen died in China\nAustralia: 14 cases\nFrance: 12 cases, 1 death\nUnited Kingdom: 9 cases\nUnited Arab Emirates: 9\nCanada: 8\nPhilippines: 3 cases, 1 death\nIndia: 3 cases\nItaly: 3\nRussia: 2\nSpain: 2\nBelgium: 1\nNepal: 1\nSri Lanka: 1\nSweden: 1\nCambodia: 1\nFinland: 1\nEgypt: 1In a recent study, China's CCDC found that the virus's fatality rate - 14.8% - is for people aged 80 or older with co-occurring medical conditions. Young and healthy people, meanwhile, typically experience much more mild symptoms, according to the BBC. Along those same lines, the WHO confirmed on Tuesday that the virus manifests as only a minor infection in four out of five people who contract it, according to the Guardian.For everybody still saying that the virus is no more dangerous than the annual flu outbreak, here's some food for thought: An analysis of 44,672 coronavirus patients in China whose diagnoses were confirmed by laboratory testing has found that 1,023 had died by Feb. 11, a fatality rate of 2.3%. That's far higher than the mortality rate for the seasonal flu.Finally, the New York Times has reviewed lockdown conditions across China, and confirmed that more than 760 million people are living in neighborhoods or villages with at least some imposed strictures regulating residents' comings and goings. That represents half of China's population, and one out of every ten people on the planet.Some neighborhoods only require residents to show ID, sign in and have their temperature checked. Other villages prohibit bringing in guests. In places with more stringent restrictions, households are only allowed to send one person out at a time - and often not even every day.Last night, Zeng reported that in some parts of Wuhan the lockdown has become so strict that people aren't allowed to come outside at all.The locking down in #Wuhan is getting tighter.

Masks are in short supply in the country due to the coronavirus outbreak.Staff at the Japanese Red Cross Kobe Hospital noticed last Thursday that four cartons containing 120 boxes of masks were missing. The hospital notified the police on Monday.Police and hospital officials say the cartons were kept in a third-floor machinery room that's normally locked. No irregularities were found when they were checked on February 3.Hospital officials say that while there are enough masks in stock for the staff, the theft is extremely regrettable.",

            "main_text": "(Adds Chinese entities informed of new rules, no immediate comment from embassy)By Jonathan LandayWASHINGTON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Tuesday said it will begin treating five major Chinese state-run media entities with U.S. operations the same as foreign embassies, requiring them to register their employees and U.S. properties with the State Department.Two senior state department officials said the decision was made because China has been tightening state control over its media and President Xi Jinping has made more aggressive use of them to spread pro-Beijing propaganda.\"The control over both the content and editorial control have only strengthened over the course of Xi Jinping's term in power,\" said one official. \"These guys are in fact arms of the CCP's (Chinese Community Party's) propaganda apparatus.\"The State Department informed the five entities of its decision by letter on Tuesday, the official said. The Chinese embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Beijing's control of China's state-owned media has become \"more and more draconian,\" the second official said.Both officials spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity.Tensions between the two superpowers have escalated since President Donald Trump came to office three years ago, with disputes ranging from trade tariffs to accusations of Chinese spying in the United States and to U.S. support for Taiwan.Tuesday's decision, the officials said, is not linked to any recent developments in Sino-U.S. relations and has been under consideration for some time.The new determination is being applied to the Xinhua News Agency, China Global Television Network, China Radio International, China Daily Distribution Corp. and Hai Tian Development USA, Inc., the officials said.China Daily is an English-language newspaper published by the Chinese Communist Party. Hai Tian Development USA distributes the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the party's Central Committee.The five entities' U.S. operations will have to disclose their personnel rosters and hiring and firing decisions and register properties in the United States that they rent or own with the State Department, the officials said.They also will have to seek advanced approval before they lease or purchase new U.S. properties, they said.One official said that the disclosures would help the State Department better understand how the entities operate in the United States.Asked if there are concerns that Beijing will retaliate against Western media based in China, one official noted that foreign news outlets there already work under strict rules and that the new disclosure rules impose no restrictions on the five state-owned Chinese entities' U.S. operations.\"These guys operate in a far more liberal environment here in the United States than any foreign press enjoy in the People's Republic of China,\" the official said.

            "main_text": "Updated at 2:24 p.m. ET\nSome 346 Americans who were evacuated from Wuhan, China, amid the deadly coronavirus outbreak emerged from their quarantine at two military bases in California on Tuesday, U.S. officials say.\nThe group includes 180 Americans who have been living under a mandatory quarantine order at Travis Air Force Base, on the outskirts of the Bay Area, roughly 40 miles southwest of Sacramento, and 166 U.S. citizens who have been living at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar near San Diego.\n\"One person from the MCAS Miramar group who is confirmed to have COVID-19 remains under care at a local hospital,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement sent to NPR.\nAll of the other U.S. evacuees \"have been medically cleared and CDC officials have lifted their quarantine orders,\" said Jason McDonald, a CDC press officer.Updated at 2:24 p.m. ETSome 346 Americans who were evacuated from Wuhan, China, amid the deadly coronavirus outbreak emerged from their quarantine at two military bases in California on Tuesday, U.S. officials say.The group includes 180 Americans who have been living under a mandatory quarantine order at Travis Air Force Base, on the outskirts of the Bay Area, roughly 40 miles southwest of Sacramento, and 166 U.S. citizens who have been living at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar near San Diego.\"One person from the MCAS Miramar group who is confirmed to have COVID-19 remains under care at a local hospital,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement sent to NPR.All of the other U.S. evacuees \"have been medically cleared and CDC officials have lifted their quarantine orders,\" said Jason McDonald, a CDC press officer.The evacuees left China on planes chartered by the State Department in early February, as the city of Wuhan, center of the novel coronavirus outbreak, was placed under a near-total lockdown. Their 14-day mandatory quarantine is now over.\"It is important to know that these people being released from quarantine pose no health risk to the surrounding community or to the communities they will be returning to,\" McDonald said.He added that all the remaining Americans who took U.S.-chartered flights out of Wuhan are expected to complete their own quarantine periods later this week.\"Newly quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers are being kept separate from those individuals who are already at Travis and nearing the end of their quarantine,\" McDonald said, referring to the ship that's been sitting at a cruise ship terminal under a quarantine in Yokohama, Japan.Tuesday's release of Americans from quarantine comes one week after a flight of 195 Americans was freed from quarantine orders at the March Air Reserve Base in Southern California.Quarantined cruise ship to get meals from Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s' charityWorld Central Kitchen, initially created by chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s to help people stricken by natural disasters in the Caribbean, says it has set up a field kitchen in a parking lot near the Diamond Princess cruise ship at Shinko Pier in Yokohama, Japan, where the vessel is nearing the end of a 14-day coronavirus quarantine.The charity is providing food for those on board in a bid to ease the strain on the ship's crew, which has been working to feed passengers, keep the ship clean and perform other duties as the cruise ship sits in isolation at the terminal.The Diamond Princess' captain announced World Central Kitchen's new role in a shipwide address Tuesday, according to passenger Matthew Smith.\"This is to relieve pressure on the crew,\" Smith said via Twitter, adding that he believes the extra help could make it easier for people working on the ship to observe quarantine rules.\"It's definitely a different situation for us,\" World Central Kitchen's Sam Bloch said in a video update about the operation, acknowledging the uncertainty over how long the quarantine might last for some passengers and crew.The food is prepared and cooked in a full kitchen before it's taken to an impromptu kitchen at the terminal, the group says. From there, it gets reheated as needed and delivered to the ship. Bloch, who directs the group's field operations, says the meals are ready to serve when their containers are loaded onto the ship by forklift.\"The crew doesn't have to cook and do all the work,\" Bloch says. \"They get to get some rest.\"Andr\u00e9s said via Twitter that the World Central Kitchen team \"will be there working side by side with everyone on the ground as long as we are needed.\"Before arriving in Japan, Bloch was working in Australia, where World Central Kitchen operates a \"relief kitchen\" to feed firefighters and evacuees. The organization is active in a number of other places, from Puerto Rico and the Bahamas to Venezuela and along the U.S.-Mexico border.Hospital director in Wuhan dies of COVID-19The director of a hospital in Wuhan, China, the center of a deadly coronavirus outbreak, has died from the disease COVID-19, state media reported Tuesday, highlighting the risk that the respiratory virus poses to health professionals.Liu Zhiming, whose age is variously being reported as 50 or 51, was head of the Wuchang Hospital. He was also one of more than 1,700 medical workers confirmed to be infected with the highly contagious virus, according to China Daily. The state news outlet adds that the number of workers dates from last Tuesday \u2014 meaning even more doctors, nurses and other medical staff might now be infected.Outbreak's pace is seen slowing in ChinaMainland China currently has seen more than 70,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to the World Health Organization. And while the country has suffered the majority of deaths associated with the outbreak, health experts in China say there are signs that the pace at which the virus is spreading might be slowing down.As NPR's Emily Feng reports from Beijing:\"Today's numbers from China's national health commission show that the rate at which new cases reported outside Hubei province, where the epidemic has been concentrated, has dropped for two weeks. China's top state epidemiologist said earlier this week that he expected the outbreak to peak sometime in April.\"However, distrust in official state statistics is still high. Hubei in part has the largest share of virus cases in China because it is the only province that discloses so called clinical cases \u2014 symptomatic patients who haven't tested positive for the virus. Other provinces are mandated to collect such data but have not disclosed these types of cases publicly.\"88 more cases on Diamond Princess cruise shipThe Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined at a terminal in Yokohama, Japan, still represents the largest cluster of COVID-19 cases outside China. On Tuesday, Japan's health ministry said tests confirmed 88 more cases \u2014 including 65 people who were identified as asymptomatic pathogen carriers. The diagnoses bring the total number of cases from the ship to 542 out of 2,404 people who have been tested, Japanese officials say.The Diamond Princess had some 3,700 people aboard when it docked in the port south of Tokyo earlier this month. But hundreds of people have since disembarked, either to receive care at local hospitals or, in the case of more than 300 American passengers, to fly back to the U.S. on chartered evacuation flights.\"We walked into the airplane hangar, and there were military people clapping and cheering for us,\" former Diamond Princess passenger Gay Courter told NPR's Morning Edition, describing the scene as she and her husband, Philip, arrived at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. \"And that's when I broke down in tears. It was this overwhelming relief.\"Sixty-one U.S. citizens remain on the Diamond Princess, which is slated to begin emerging from its blanket quarantine on Wednesday. While many passengers will be allowed to leave the ship if they test negative for the new coronavirus, others will have to undergo a longer quarantine if they've been in close contact with anyone who has the COVID-19 disease.Infected U.S. evacuees taken to Omaha, NebraskaAfter the U.S. passengers were taken off the Diamond Princess, 14 of them were revealed to have tested positive for the new coronavirus. U.S. officials say they got the results after the patients had been taken off the ship \u2014 and that all 14 were placed in a special section at the rear of one of the chartered jets because of the possible health risk to other evacuees.The evacuees were flown to Lackland in Texas and Travis Air Force Base in California \u2014 the two designated quarantine spots for Diamond Princess passengers taken to the U.S. But 13 infected evacuees were then flown to Omaha, Nebraska, to receive care at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. It's not clear why the other infected evacuee wasn't among them.\"Those who have tested positive for this novel coronavirus, are only showing mild symptoms of the disease,\" Nebraska Medicine said in a statement.The facility includes a 20-bed national quarantine unit, where 12 of the evacuees are now being monitored. But another evacuee was deemed to need specialized care and was placed in a biocontainment unit.The University of Nebraska Medical Center runs the national Training, Simulation and Quarantine Center, which it says has \"the nation's only federal quarantine unit and simulated biocontainment units for advanced experiential training.\"The center has been involved in combating other dangerous outbreaks in recent years, including the Ebola virus outbreak that started in 2014.",

            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.The World Health Organization's (WHO's) online Ebola dashboard shows a case count of 3,433 today, with a single newly confirmed case. The death toll is now 2,249 in an outbreak that has lasted 18 months in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).The WHO said 334 suspected cases are currently under investigation. According to the latest weekly report from the WHO's African regional office, only one case has been reported in the past week, from Beni. In the past 3 weeks, 11 cases have been recorded.\"Beni remains the main hotspot for the continuing EVD outbreak as the number of new cases keep lowering,\" the WHO said. \"While there is room for cautious optimism around the decline in new confirmed cases, continued access and heightened vigilance is required to maintain case investigation and contact tracing activities in all health zones.\"Beni has reported 90% of cases in the past 21 days. WHO Ebola dashboard  Feb 17 WHO African regional office reportThe WHO's African regional office also said that both Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR) are in the midst of measles outbreaks, with both countries reporting increasing case counts since the first of the year.In Chad, 1,276 cases, including 14 deaths have been reported since Jan 1, with 352 suspected measles cases and 4 deaths reported in the week ending on Feb 9.\"Most, 78%, of the investigated cases never received any vaccination against measles,\" the WHO said. \"Sixty percent of the investigated cases were under five years of age while 19% were between 5 and 14 years and 14% were 15 years and above.\"In CAR, a total of 1,498 suspected measles cases, including 15 deaths, have been recorded since the first of the year. The outbreak has been ongoing since early 2019. From Jan 1, 2019, through Feb 9, 2020, a total of 5,724 suspected measles cases, including 83 deaths (case-fatality rate, 1.45%) have been reported in 13 health districts.Almost three fourths of the cases (72%) are in children under the age of 5. Feb 17 WHO African regional office reportIn a global flu update yesterday, the WHO noted high activity across the Northern Hemisphere, though some European countries seemed to have reached their seasonal peak.Globally, 59% of detections are influenza A, and of subtyped flu A viruses, about 76% were 2009 H1N1. Of characterized B viruses, 98.5% belonged to the B-Victoria lineage.Both Canada and the United States still have elevated levels of flu, with a strong showing from influenza B. Mexico reported increased activity due to influenza A H1N1. Some countries in Northern and Eastern Europe reported increasing flu detections, but Ireland and the United Kingdom reported a decrease in activity.In China, the WHO said, \"ILI activity increased once again after a slight decrease reported in recent weeks and was at a greater level than the activity recorded during the same time period in the three previous seasons.\"In Central America and the Caribbean, flu detections were low.

            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.CARB-X said today it has awarded Lytica Therapeutics, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, up to $5.3 million to develop antibacterial peptides that have broad activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria for treating lung and other infections.In a news release, CARB-X (the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator) said Lytica could receive up to $11.6 million in additional funding if the project achieves certain development milestones, for a potential total of $16.9 million.\"There is an urgent need for innovative therapeutics and approaches to drug-resistant infections that, today, are killing some 700,000 people around the world each year,\" said Erin Duffy, PhD, chief of research and development at CARB-X. \"The Lytica project is in the early phases of development, but if successful and ultimately approved for use in patients, it could represent tremendous improvement in the treatment of multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens.\"Antimicrobial peptides are a family of peptides with therapeutic potential, but their clinical use is limited mostly to topical applications because of problems with toxicity, stability, and efficacy. Lytica's proprietary \"stapling\" technology aims to overcome these hurdles.The company has produced compounds called stapled antimicrobial peptides that have demonstrated potent activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria, stability against degrading, and wide therapeutic potential. If successful, the project could produce treatments for a wide range of serious infections, including lung, urinary tract, and intra-abdominal infections.Since its launch in 2016, CARB-X, a public-private partnership, has announced 57 awards exceeding $193 million, with additional funds possible if project milestones are met. Its goal is to invest $500 million by the end of 2021.Feb 18 CARB-X news releaseIn a report today on airborne antimicrobial resistance, the UK Environment Agency says much more research is needed to determine how much of a health risk it poses.The review and analysis of 88 relevant papers obtained from three academic databases found that, despite differences in study environments, methods used, and antibiotics studied, some basic conclusions emerged. Among those conclusions are that tetracycline resistance appears to be more prevalent in agriculturally associated air, industrial activities involving fecal matter (including farms) are associated with the highest levels of multidrug resistance reported to date, and the ubiquitous use of azole antifungals in medicine and agriculture\u2014along with the ability of fungi to travel long distances in the air\u2014makes airborne antifungal resistance a relevant threat.Some of the questions that still need to be addressed, according to the report, are whether air is a primary route of antimicrobial resistance transmission to humans and other vulnerable hosts, and how the resulting risk compares with other transmission methods. The researchers say exploring the biophysics of airborne antimicrobial resistance could help answer some of these questions.\"More research is recommended to close knowledge gaps and test emergent hypotheses,\" the authors of the report write. \"Also needed is a more concerted effort to report and share the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing in a standardised way, and more careful and standardised collection and reporting of air sampling.\" Feb 18 UK Environment Agency reportAn analysis of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates collected from young children in primary care settings has found reduced susceptibility to several antibiotic classes in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) era, researchers report today in Clinical Infectious Diseases.In the prospective cohort study, investigators from Rochester General Hospital Research Institute in Rochester, New York, collected nasopharyngeal and middle ear fluid samples from children ages 6 to 36 months during acute otitis media (ear infection) and routine healthy visits at primary care pediatric practices in Rochester from 2006 through 2016. They then performed antibiotic susceptibility testing on S pneumoniae isolates against a panel of 16 antibiotics from 10 classes. All children were up to date on vaccines, receiving the PCV-7 vaccine from 2006 until April 2010 and PCV-13 after April 2010.From 2006 through 2016, 1,201 S pneumoniae isolates were characterized from 1,072 visits of 448 children. Analysis of susceptibility trends showed that, after introduction of PCV-13, susceptibility to S pneumoniae to antibiotics, especially penicillin, initially improved, largely because of the disappearance of serotype 19A, which is included in PCV-13. But beginning in 2013, antibiotic susceptibility among S pneumoniae strains began decreasing with the emergence of three serotypes (11A, 35B, and 35F) not included in PCV-13. In addition to reduced susceptibility to penicillin, the most recent isolates also showed reduced susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and carbapenems.The authors of the study say the reduced susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and carbapenems could have implications for future treatment of invasive pneumococcal disease. They also note that neither of the two PCVs in advanced development (PCV-15 and PCV-20) includes serotypes 35B or 35F.Feb 18 Clin Infect Dis abstractGet CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now\u00bbUnrestricted financial support provided byGrant support for ASP provided byBecome an underwriter\u00bbCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

Howard said they developed not only talking points for students, but correspondence for parents. Monday evening, Howard sent out a robocall to parents letting them know a student passed due to flu-like symptoms.This morning, Howard said that a safe room has been set up for students at the school who might need counseling.\u201cWe have two substitute teachers on site today to help support teachers who are dealing with this situation as well,\u201d Howard said, adding that counselors will be on site for most of the week. \u201cYou can plan for these types of things but until we see the amount of grieving and support students need, you just don\u2019t know.\u201dHoward told The World early Tuesday morning that the students seemed to be handling the news well so far. Administrators and support staff walked the halls to touch base with students before class.\u201cThe student was a football and baseball player and he was also in the band,\u201d Howard said, explaining that the school has already reached out to those groups and will provide additional support to both the student\u2019s advisory class and band class. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to wrap our arms around everybody ... Anytime the Marshfield family is met with tragedy, it is heartbreaking but I can\u2019t thank the crisis team and support staff enough for coming together on a holiday and coming up with a supportive plan for staff and students.\u201dThis story will be updated as more information is made available.Reporter Jillian Ward can be reached at 541-269-1222, ext. 235, or by email at jillian.ward@theworldlink.com.

The process involves injecting pseudo-coronavirus into genetically altered mice that produce human-like antibodies.\n    \n    Rockland/Westchester Journal NewsThere are 26 people in Westchester County being quarantined after returning from recent travel to areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak in China, authorities said Tuesday.None of the Westchester residents, who are being voluntarily quarantined\u00a0mostly in their homes, have shown symptoms of the coronavirus, called COVID-19, according to Dr. Sherlita Amler, county health commissioner.\"These people are not ill, but we still have to monitor them,\" Amler said Tuesday, during a news conference.Similar public-health quarantines of travelers are underway in other communities statewide and across the country. The people will be monitored by county health officials for the 14 days since they departed from the locations affected by coronavirus, Amler said.Authorities declined to disclose the locations of the people being quarantined in Westchester, citing privacy concerns.A Centers for Disease Control representative is seen aboard a 737 cargo plane evacuating passengers who were quarantined on a cruise ship in Japan.\u00a0(Photo: Courtesy of Sommer Gunia)The reports come as\u00a0Chinese officials released\u00a0data Tuesday indicating the new virus could be 20 times more lethal than the flu.The\u00a0global coronavirus death toll hit\u00a01,875, with all\u00a0but a handful of the fatalities in China.\u00a0Total infections rose Tuesday to more than 73,000, all but a few hundred in China.\u00a0There had been 29 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S.New York state has seen 25 total cases of potential coroanvirus return negative test results, including 19\u00a0outside of New York City, according to the latest state data released Tuesday. There were no pending cases being tested.Amler noted that the 26 people being monitored in Westchester County would only be tested if they started to show symptoms. Similarly, Monroe County last week announced it was monitoring six asymptomatic\u00a0travelers for coronavirus.Common signs of the infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.\u00a0If it worsens, it can\u00a0cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure or even\u00a0death.More:\u00a0Cruise ship stranded at sea by coronavirus, carrying Greenburgh couple comes to rest in CambodiaMore:\u00a0NY slammed with record-high influenza cases while all eyes on coronavirusMore:\u00a0How NY scientists are using mice as the secret weapon against the outbreakThe Westchester travelers being quarantined passed through screening protocols of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is overseeing questioning and other screening\u00a0at airports and other entry points\u00a0when Americans return from China and other countries affected by the outbreak.Public-health officials are communicating regularly with the Westchester people in quarantine, including through video conferencing via smartphones. If any of them start showing signs of illness and require transport to a medical facility, the county public safety and\u00a0emergency services agencies would oversee the transport, Amler said.A 737 cargo plane is used to transport Diamond Princess cruise passengers from Japan to Texas.

            "headline": "Japan prepares for widespread coronavirus outbreak",
            "main_text": "The number of cases in Japan stands at more than 500 as of writing, including 454 from a quarantined cruise ship docked near Tokyo.Anxiety surrounding the virus has been palpable for weeks, with citizens throughout the country wearing face masks and carrying alcoholic disinfectant. But the concern reached new levels on Monday, after news broke of a health ministry official testing positive. The man, who is in his 50s, had been working on the quarantined cruise ship, reportedly helping control traffic as infected passengers disembarked. Worryingly, he was infected despite only working for about 10 minutes and maintaining a distance of at least two meters from the passengers.On Monday, the health ministry announced a directive instructing all municipalities to expand screenings to include people with symptoms who have not traveled to the Chinese provinces of Hubei and Zhejiang. Hubei is the epicenter of the outbreak, and has close business links with Zhejiang.The measure comes after infections were confirmed among people who had neither been to the provinces nor come into contact with people who had.Laboratories, quarantine stations, universities, and companies around the country are now increasing their personnel in an effort to meet the new testing requirements. The health ministry says the expanded manpower will enable screening of an additional 1,050 people a day.The ministry says it will also provide medical institutions that have adequate screening equipment with the chemicals and materials needed to conduct testing.The ministry also announced a set of standards to help people decide when to seek medical assistance:Additionally, ministry officials are urging people to stay home from school or work if they display any symptoms of the cold.Health experts are working around the clock on treatment. While it will be some time before a vaccine is available for widespread use, there are signs that one already existing drug may be effective at combating the virus.The director of Disease Control and Prevention Center, Norio Omagari, told NHK World that a team of researchers from his organization is conducting clinical trials on a drug commonly used to treat HIV. Omagari says that some patients have recovered after the tests, adding that his team is expediting the process to verify the effectiveness of the treatment.The outbreak is affecting a wide range of activities in business and culture.Japan's Imperial Household Agency has canceled Emperor Naruhito's public birthday greetings, which were schedule for February 23. The event would have marked the emperor's first birthday since ascending to the throne and thousands were expected to attend. It is the first imperial birthday greeting to be called off since 1996, when there was a hostage crisis at the Japanese embassy in Peru.On the business side, Japanese companies with operations in Hubei Province and other parts of China have been struggling to maintain production. The full extent of the impact of the outbreak is difficult to assess but experts say it will prove to be a major setback for the global economy.",

            "main_text": "The effect of anesthetic techniques on cancer recurrence has been the subject of intensive research in the past years, as it affects a large proportion of the population. The use of opioids and halogenated agents in cancer patients during the perioperative period may be related to higher rates of cancer recurrence and reduced disease-free survival.This was a prospective study. The sample was composed of 100 patients who underwent a radical cystectomy for infiltrating bladder cancer in a reference center. We compared disease-free survival associated with combined anesthesia versus opiate-based analgesia. The relationship between the administered hypnotic and disease-free survival was also investigated.The median disease-free survival of the patients who received combined anesthesia was 585 (240-1,005) days versus 210 (90-645) days in the other group. A significant difference was observed between the two groups (p = 0.01). Combined analysis of all groups revealed significant differences in disease-free survival between patients who received combined anesthesia with propofol (510 [315-1,545] disease-free days) and those who received sevoflurane and opioids (150 [90-450] disease-free days) (p = 0.02).Anesthesia may play a crucial role in tumor relapse, as it is administered at the moment of the greatest risk of dissemination: surgical handling of the tumor. Opioids and volatile agents have been related to an increased risk for cancer recurrence. We compared the use of propofol + local anesthesia versus sevoflurane + opioids and also found that disease-free survival was longer among patients who received propofol + local anesthesia. Disease-free survival increases with the use of propofol in combination with epidural anesthesia in patients who undergo surgery for infiltrating bladder cancer.Oncology. 2020 Jan 21 [Epub ahead of print]Jose Luis Guerrero Orriach, Aida Raigon Ponferrada, Alfredo Malo Manso, Bernardo Herrera Imbroda, Juan Jose Escalona Belmonte, Marta Ramirez Aliaga, Alicia Ramirez Fernandez, Julia Diaz Crespo, Angela M Soriano Perez, Ana Fontaneda Heredia, Maria Emilia Dominguez Recio, Manuel Rubio Navarro, Jose Cruz Ma\u00f1asInstitute of Biomedical Research in Malaga (IBIMA), Malaga, Spain, emailProtector.addCloakedMailto(\"ep_6d4dd3ed\", 0);., Department of Anesthesiology, Virgen de la Victoria University Hospital, Malaga, Spain., Institute of Biomedical Research in Malaga (IBIMA), Malaga, Spain., Department of Anesthesiology, Complejo Hospitalario de Ja\u00e9n, Ja\u00e9n, Spain., Department of Oncology, Virgen de la Victoria University Hospital, Malaga, Spain.PubMed http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31962315COPYRIGHT \u00a9 2002 - 2020 DIGITAL SCIENCE PRESS, INC.Login to update email address, newsletter preferences and use bookmarks.EmailPassword",

            "main_text": "A cruise ship, named the Diamond Princess, had travel that originated in Yokohama on 20 January and included stops in Japan (Kagoshima), Hong Kong, Vietnam, Taiwan and Japan (Okinawa), before arriving back in Yokohama on 3 February. During this time, a passenger who disembarked on 25 January in Hong Kong, has presented with cough since 19\u00a023 Jan and was confirmed positive for Novel coronavirus on 1 February. The Japanese government requested that the Diamond Princess stay at port, with no passengers or crew disembarking, in Yokohama when it arrived on 3 February. During 3-4 February, health status of all passengers and crew members were checked by questionnaire by quarantine officers, and respiratory specimens were taken from symptomatic passengers, crew, and their close contacts to test for Novel coronavirus. On 5 February, a lab-confirmed case of COVID-19 led to the quarantine of the Diamond Princess for 14 days beginning at 7am, with passengers requested to stay in their cabins. As of 5 February, there was a total of 3711 individuals on board the Diamond Princess, with 2666 passengers and 1045 crew members.At the beginning of the quarantine period, crew members were provided with personal protective equipment (PPE) and instructed on appropriate IPC practices. On 7 February, passengers were provided thermometers for self-monitoring of body temperature, with instructions on calling a \u201cFever Call Center\u201d, if they had a fever above 37.5C. Passengers who developed fever were referred to the medical team in charge and were tested for Novel coronavirus. Passengers who developed serious illness, including non-COVID-19 morbidities, were referred the ship\u2019s Medical Center, which provided essential health services. Those passengers with lab-confirmed COVID-19 were disembarked and transferred to an isolation ward at healthcare facilities. Their cabinmates were defined as \u201cclose contacts\u201d and were therefore tested. If positive, they were also confirmed as a case and disembarked to a healthcare facility. If they tested negative, they remained on board but with a 14-day quarantine period reset after the last contact with the confirmed case. All crew and healthcare staff onboard the Diamond Princess were instructed to follow international guidance on infection prevention and control. To maintain operations of the ship, some crew continued to perform essential, limited services while the ship remained in quarantine. This led to those crew members not remaining fully isolated, in the same manner as passengers, during the quarantine period.Initially, only symptomatic cases and close contacts were being tested for COVID-19. This was changed on 11 February, due to the expansion of laboratory capacity, with quarantine officers systematically collecting respiratory specimens from all passengers by age group, starting with those 80 years old and older as well as individuals with co-morbidities, such as diabetes or a heart condition. Respiratory specimens collected were tested via PCR for confirmation of Novel coronavirus. Epidemiological data collected was initially limited due to the emergency nature of the quarantine and included data on onset of symptoms, date of lab confirmation, and close contacts. A confirmed case of COVID-19, for this report, is anyone, passenger or crew, who had a positive PCR test for Novel coronavirus, independent of their symptom presentation. In most cases, the \u201cpopulation on board,\u201d refers to the 3,711 passenger and crew aboard Diamond Princess on 5 February.As of 18 February, there have been 531 confirmed cases (14.3% of all individuals on board on 5 February), including 65 crew and 466 passengers. A total 2404 respiratory specimens were tested, and 542 were positive (22.5), including double tests. Among confirmed COVID-19 cases with recorded symptom onset (n=184), there were 33 (18%) with onset dates before 6 February, which was the first full day of quarantine, and 151 (82%) with onset dates on or after the 6th. A total 255 (48%) of the confirmed cases were asymptomatic when the respiratory specimen was collected. Of these, 8 were crew and 247 were passengers. (Information on development of symptoms after disembarkation of asymptomatic confirmed cases is not currently available.) A total 23 passengers with reported onset dates were confirmed after another passenger in the same cabin had been confirmed. From 13 February to now, 81% of cases among confirmed passengers or crew with reported onset dates (n=22) occurred in crew (n=13) or passengers from cabins with a previously confirmed case (n=5).Based on the number of confirmed cases by onset date, there is clear evidence that substantial transmission of COVID-19 had been occurring prior to implementation of quarantine on the Diamond Princess on 5 February (see also febrile patient visits to the on-board clinic below). The decline in the number of confirmed cases, based on reported onset dates, implies that the quarantine intervention was effective in reducing transmission among passengers. Transmission toward the end of the quarantine period, which is scheduled to end for most passengers on 19 Feb, appears to have occurred mostly among crew or within passenger cabins. It should be noted that due to the nature of the ship, individual isolation of all those aboard was not possible. Sharing of cabins was necessary, and some crew had to continue to perform essential duties for the functioning of the vessel with passengers aboard.Recent confirmations of asymptomatic cases can be explained by the systematic testing of passengers that began around 14 Feb. Although some of these cases may have been secondary cases within a given cabin, it is difficult to know when transmission occurred. They may have been infected before the quarantine began. Nevertheless, these asymptomatic cases have been disembarked and their cabinmates have been defined as close contacts with their 14-day isolation reset on the day the asymptomatic case was disembarked. The systematic testing of asymptomatic cases was useful in screening these persons before allowing them to disembark.Those persons (mostly passengers) who have completed the 14-day quarantine, have not tested positive, and pass a medical check on the 14th day, will be disembarked on the 19th.Those individuals who were in contact with a confirmed case will be put in isolation until they complete the 14-day period beginning after the last day of their suspected contact with a case. This includes a large proportion of the crew members of the Diamond Princess. The crew performed essential tasks that allowed the quarantine to occur successfully for 14 days and should be appreciated for their service.As the persons aboard were exposed to a high-risk environment for a prolonged period, all persons who disembark should be careful about the health conditions for the time being and immediately report to a public health center if they develop symptoms.Percent of persons aboard who were confirmed with COVID-19 by age group and symptom status at the time of specimen collection.Age groupSymptomatic confirmed cases (%)Asymptomatic confirmed cases (%)Total confirmed cases (%)Persons aboard on 5 February00-090(0)1(6)1(6)1610-191(4)1(4)2(9)2320-2918(5)2(1)20(6)34730-3918(4)5(1)23(5)42940-4918(5)7(2)25(8)33350-5927(7)22(6)49(12)39860-6973(8)56(6)129(14)92470-7992(9)136(13)228(22)101580-8927(13)25(12)52(24)21590-992(18)0(0)2(18)11Total276(7)255(7)531(14)3711Number of confirmed COVID-19 cases with reported onset dates, by onset date, aboard Diamond Princess, 6 \u2013 17 February 2020 (n=151)Febrile Patients, by date of clinic visit, Diamond Princess clinic, 19 Jan - 2 Feb 2020 (n=79)Characteristics of COVID-19 Cases with reported on-set dates of 6 \u2013 17 Feb 2020 (n=151)*.Date of Onset (n cases)CrewPassengersPassengers from cabins with another confirmed case (%)17 Feb (0)00016 Feb (0)00015 Feb (1)10014 Feb (5)411 (100%) [0]13 Feb (16)884 (50%) [2]12 Feb (12)750 (00%) [2]11 Feb (18)7113 (27%) [1]10 Feb (10)373 (43%) [1]9 Feb (24)5196 (32%) [9]8 Feb (18)2161 (6%) [3]7 Feb (31)2294 (14%) [10]6 Feb (16)1151 (7%) [6]Total4011123 (21%) [34]*\u00a0The total number of cases in this table (n=151) is the total number of cases with known onset dates.Note, the number in brackets represents the number of additional confirmed cases in the same cabin with unknown onset date.Copyright 1998 National Institute of Infectious Diseases, JapanTop\nDesktop version",

Hopefully, it\u2019s a happy end, though it\u2019s really difficult to follow development and separate confirmed info from rumors.Bulk carrier MAGNATE with 19 crew on board arrived at Chennai, eastern coast of India, on Feb 18, from Shanghai, reportedly with cargo of steel. The ship was berthed, and boarded by medics, alerted understood, in advance, on presence of two sick crew, with virus-like symptoms of fever and flu. 2 sick seamen were isolated and checked, both tested coronavirus positive. They\u2019ve been taken to hospital, the rest of the crew are isolated in superstructure, the ship is fenced off at shore side, so that no docker or other port personnel would mistakenly blunder in and approach the ship. It is to be decided yet, whether to offload the ship, or send her back to China with all cargo remaining on board.\nFears spread further, and it was said, that workers refuse to offload cars from car carrier GLOVIS SKY, berthed next to unfortunate MAGNATE.\nWhat\u2019s more scary \u2013 coronavirus, or panic virus?\nBulk carrier MAGNATE, IMO 9320269, dwt 18828, built 2004, flag Panama, manager WISDOM MARINE LINES SA, Taiwan.comments// Mikhail VoytenkoMy name is Mikhail Voytenko, I\u2019m Russian, professional merchant marine navigator, by education and former experience.

Two other groups were expected to be cleared later this week.Sacred Heart chosen for its isolation roomsProvidence Sacred Heart was chosen \"because of its secured airborne infection isolation rooms,\" health officials said. Normal hospital operations will remain unaffected.During a press conference Thursday, health officials said it was a federal decision to send the patients to Spokane.Sacred Heart is one of 10 hospitals in the U.S. with this specialized unit.The other hospitals are located in Boston; New York City; Baltimore; Atlanta; Minneapolis; Galveston, Texas; Omaha, Nebraska; Denver; and Los Angeles.The unit in Omaha has also received coronavirus patients, health officials said on Thursday. \u00a0It is the first time the Special Pathogens Unit at Sacred Heart will be used to treat patients in this capacity.Health officials said on Thursday that isolation room staff will wear fluid impermeable gowns, gloves and N-95 filtration masks with a face shield, and will use powered air purifying respirators.\"The level of personal protective equipment we are wearing is in alignment with the CDC guildines they have put out for caring for these patients, so that includes airborne protection, mucus membrane protection, and contact precautions,\" said Christa Arguinchona, who manages the Special Pathogens Unit.Lutz said on Wednesday that healthcare workers have trained for this scenario for several years.The move is a joint effort between the Spokane Regional Health District, Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center and the Washington State Department of Health, according to the release.The most recent numbers from the state Department of Health indicate that 779 people in Washington are under public health supervision due to coronavirus.

Five other people who have shown symptoms of the virus have also been taken to hospitals.Hundreds of passengers left the Diamond Princess cruise ship on Feb. 18 after their two-week quarantine ended.The Spokane Regional Health District reported on Wednesday that all patients arriving in Spokane had tested positive for coronavirus.Scott Pauley, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, declined to tell The Associated Press where the other cruise ship passengers were taken, apart from Spokane.Spokane County Health Officer Dr. Bob Lutz said the patients were transported to the Spokane International Airport from Travis Air Force Base near Sacramento, California.One pair arrived before noon on Thursday, while the others arrived shortly before 4 p.m. Hospital staff said the patients are in satisfactory condition as of Friday morning.RELATED: 11 US cruise ship passengers test positive for coronavirusAn ambulance then transported the patients to Sacred Heart Medical Center.\"It is no risk to the general population. I will emphasize that as much as I possibly can,\" Lutz said at a press conference.Lutz added that health officials say the risk of contracting the coronavirus for people living throughout the United States is \"low.\"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which selected Sacred Heart, originally notified the hospital on Wednesday that it would receive five patients but the number dropped to four later that night, health officials said on Thursday.Health officials did not specify if whether the patients contracted the virus in China or the United States.Sacred Heart staff told KREM's Taylor Viydo on Thursday that they are expected to stay at the hospital for at least two weeks.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 180 people at Travis Air Force Base were medically cleared to leave the base on Tuesday. Two other groups were expected to be cleared later this week.Sacred Heart chosen for its isolation roomsProvidence Sacred Heart was chosen \"because of its secured airborne infection isolation rooms,\" health officials said. Normal hospital operations will remain unaffected.During a press conference Thursday, health officials said it was a federal decision to send the patients to Spokane.Sacred Heart is one of 10 hospitals in the U.S. with this specialized unit.The other hospitals are located in Boston; New York City; Baltimore; Atlanta; Minneapolis; Galveston, Texas; Omaha, Nebraska; Denver; and Los Angeles.The unit in Omaha has also received coronavirus patients, health officials said on Thursday. \u00a0It is the first time the Special Pathogens Unit at Sacred Heart will be used to treat patients in this capacity.Health officials said on Thursday that isolation room staff will wear fluid impermeable gowns, gloves and N-95 filtration masks with a face shield, and will use powered air purifying respirators.\"The level of personal protective equipment we are wearing is in alignment with the CDC guildines they have put out for caring for these patients, so that includes airborne protection, mucus membrane protection, and contact precautions,\" said Christa Arguinchona, who manages the Special Pathogens Unit.Lutz said on Wednesday that healthcare workers have trained for this scenario for several years.The move is a joint effort between the Spokane Regional Health District, Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center and the Washington State Department of Health, according to the release.The most recent numbers from the state Department of Health indicate that 779 people in Washington are under public health supervision due to coronavirus. These people are being monitored due to risk of having contracted coronavirus.RELATED: Number of people in Washington under public health supervision due to coronavirus rises to 779Nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists 479 people under investigation for coronavirus. All of these people either are or will be tested.There have been 15 positive tests for coronavirus in the United States, according to the CDC.The Department of Health released a statement to KREM on Wednesday night, saying they had confidence in assisting Sacred Heart.The statement reads:\"The Department of Health stands ready to support the Spokane Regional Health District and Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane in preparation for the arrival of 5 individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19. We want to reiterate that the risk to the public from COVID-19 remains low.The health workers at Sacred Heart in Spokane are trained to offer the safest, highest quality care to their patients. Sacred Heart\u2019s Special Pathogens Unit is specially equipped to treat patients with infectious diseases as well.We have the highest confidence in the medical professionals assisting with the care and transport for these people and we remain committed to assisting our partners in Spokane as needed.\"See all of the latest coverage of the coronavirus patients in Spokane\u00a0in our\u00a0YouTube playlist:RELATED: Will wearing a mask protect you from coronavirus?RELATED: Coronavirus death toll hits 2,100 in mainland ChinaRELATED: \u2018It is really eerie\u2019: Spokane native living in China amid coronavirus outbreak",

The virus binds to host cells through its trimeric spike glycoprotein, making this protein a key target for potential therapies and diagnostics. Wrapp et al. determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution structure of the 2019-nCoV trimeric spike protein by cryo\u2013electron microscopy. Using biophysical assays, the authors show that this protein binds at least 10 times more tightly than the corresponding spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2013CoV to their common host cell receptor. They also tested three antibodies known to bind to the SARS-CoV spike protein but did not detect binding to the 2019-nCoV spike protein. These studies provide valuable information to guide the development of medical counter-measures for 2019-nCoV.Science, this issue p. 1260The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) represents a pandemic threat that has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure development, we determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also provide biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with higher affinity than does severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV S. Additionally, we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019-nCoV S, suggesting that antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two RBDs. The structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable the rapid development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to address the ongoing public health crisis.The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has recently emerged as a human pathogen in the city of Wuhan in China\u2019s Hubei province, causing fever, severe respiratory illness, and pneumonia\u2014a disease recently named COVID-19 (1, 2). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 16 February 2020, there had been >51,000 confirmed cases globally, leading to at least 1600 deaths. The emerging pathogen was rapidly characterized as a new member of the betacoronavirus genus, closely related to several bat coronaviruses and to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (3, 4). Compared with SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV appears to be more readily transmitted from human to human, spreading to multiple continents and leading to the WHO\u2019s declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 (1, 5, 6).2019-nCoV makes use of a densely glycosylated spike (S) protein to gain entry into host cells. The S protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein that exists in a metastable prefusion conformation that undergoes a substantial structural rearrangement to fuse the viral membrane with the host cell membrane (7, 8). This process is triggered when the S1 subunit binds to a host cell receptor. Receptor binding destabilizes the prefusion trimer, resulting in shedding of the S1 subunit and transition of the S2 subunit to a stable postfusion conformation (9). To engage a host cell receptor, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 undergoes hinge-like conformational movements that transiently hide or expose the determinants of receptor binding. These two states are referred to as the \u201cdown\u201d conformation and the \u201cup\u201d conformation, where down corresponds to the receptor-inaccessible state and up corresponds to the receptor-accessible state, which is thought to be less stable (10\u201313). Because of the indispensable function of the S protein, it represents a target for antibody-mediated neutralization, and characterization of the prefusion S structure would provide atomic-level information to guide vaccine design and development.Based on the first reported genome sequence of 2019-nCoV (4), we expressed ectodomain residues 1 to 1208 of 2019-nCoV S, adding two stabilizing proline mutations in the C-terminal S2 fusion machinery using a previous stabilization strategy that proved effective for other betacoronavirus S proteins (11, 14). Figure 1A shows the domain organization of the expression construct, and figure S1 shows the purification process. We obtained ~0.5 mg/liter of the recombinant prefusion-stabilized S ectodomain from FreeStyle 293 cells and purified the protein to homogeneity by affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography (fig. S1). Cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM) grids were prepared using this purified, fully glycosylated S protein, and preliminary screening revealed a high particle density with little aggregation near the edges of the holes.(A) Schematic of 2019-nCoV S primary structure colored by domain. Domains that were excluded from the ectodomain expression construct or could not be visualized in the final map are colored white. SS, signal sequence; S2\u2032, S2\u2032 protease cleavage site; FP, fusion peptide; HR1, heptad repeat 1; CH, central helix; CD, connector domain; HR2, heptad repeat 2; TM, transmembrane domain; CT, cytoplasmic tail. Arrows denote protease cleavage sites. (B) Side and top views of the prefusion structure of the 2019-nCoV S protein with a single RBD in the up conformation. The two RBD down protomers are shown as cryo-EM density in either white or gray and the RBD up protomer is shown in ribbons colored corresponding to the schematic in (A).After collecting and processing 3207 micrograph movies, we obtained a 3.5-\u00c5-resolution three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of an asymmetrical trimer in which a single RBD was observed in the up conformation. (Fig. 1B, fig. S2, and table S1). Because of the small size of the RBD (~21 kDa), the asymmetry of this conformation was not readily apparent until ab initio 3D reconstruction and classification were performed (Fig. 1B and fig. S3). By using the 3D variability feature in cryoSPARC v2 (15), we observed breathing of the S1 subunits as the RBD underwent a hinge-like movement, which likely contributed to the relatively poor local resolution of S1 compared with the more stable S2 subunit (movies S1 and S2). This seemingly stochastic RBD movement has been captured during structural characterization of the closely related betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as the more distantly related alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (10, 11, 13, 16). The observation of this phenomenon in 2019-nCoV S suggests that it shares the same mechanism of triggering that is thought to be conserved among the Coronaviridae, wherein receptor binding to exposed RBDs leads to an unstable three-RBD up conformation that results in shedding of S1 and refolding of S2 (11, 12).Because the S2 subunit appeared to be a symmetric trimer, we performed a 3D refinement imposing C3 symmetry, resulting in a 3.2-\u00c5-resolution map with excellent density for the S2 subunit. Using both maps, we built most of the 2019-nCoV S ectodomain, including glycans at 44 of the 66 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimer (fig. S4). Our final model spans S residues 27 to 1146, with several flexible loops omitted. Like all previously reported coronavirus S ectodomain structures, the density for 2019-nCoV S begins to fade after the connector domain, reflecting the flexibility of the heptad repeat 2 domain in the prefusion conformation (fig. S4A) (13, 16\u201318).The overall structure of 2019-nCoV S resembles that of SARS-CoV S, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 3.8 \u00c5 over 959 C\u03b1 atoms (Fig. 2A). One of the larger differences between these two structures (although still relatively minor) is the position of the RBDs in their respective down conformations. Whereas the SARS-CoV RBD in the down conformation packs tightly against the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the neighboring protomer, the 2019-nCoV RBD in the down conformation is angled closer to the central cavity of the trimer (Fig. 2B). Despite this observed conformational difference, when the individual structural domains of 2019-nCoV S are aligned to their counterparts from SARS-CoV S, they reflect the high degree of structural homology between the two proteins, with the NTDs, RBDs, subdomains 1 and 2 (SD1 and SD2), and S2 subunits yielding individual RMSD values of 2.6 \u00c5, 3.0 \u00c5, 2.7 \u00c5, and 2.0 \u00c5, respectively (Fig. 2C).(A) Single protomer of 2019-nCoV S with the RBD in the down conformation (left) is shown in ribbons colored according to Fig. 1. A protomer of 2019-nCoV S in the RBD up conformation is shown (center) next to a protomer of SARS-CoV S in the RBD up conformation (right), displayed as ribbons and colored white (PDB ID: 6CRZ). (B) RBDs of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV aligned based on the position of the adjacent NTD from the neighboring protomer. The 2019-nCoV RBD is colored green and the SARS-CoV RBD is colored white. The 2019-nCoV NTD is colored blue. (C) Structural domains from 2019-nCoV S have been aligned to their counterparts from SARS-CoV S as follows: NTD (top left), RBD (top right), SD1 and SD2 (bottom left), and S2 (bottom right).2019-nCoV S shares 98% sequence identity with the S protein from the bat coronavirus RaTG13, with the most notable variation arising from an insertion in the S1/S2 protease cleavage site that results in an \u201cRRAR\u201d furin recognition site in 2019-nCoV (19) rather than the single arginine in SARS-CoV (fig. S5) (20\u201323). Notably, amino acid insertions that create a polybasic furin site in a related position in hemagglutinin proteins are often found in highly virulent avian and human influenza viruses (24). In the structure reported here, the S1/S2 junction is in a disordered, solvent-exposed loop. In addition to this insertion of residues in the S1/S2 junction, 29 variant residues exist between 2019-nCoV S and RaTG13 S, with 17 of these positions mapping to the RBD (figs. S5 and S6). We also analyzed the 61 available 2019-nCoV S sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and found that there were only nine amino acid substitutions among all deposited sequences. Most of these substitutions are relatively conservative and are not expected to have a substantial effect on the structure or function of the 2019-nCoV S protein (fig. S6).Recent reports demonstrating that 2019-nCoV S and SARS-CoV S share the same functional host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (22, 25\u201327), prompted us to quantify the kinetics of this interaction by surface plasmon resonance. ACE2 bound to the 2019-nCoV S ectodomain with ~15 nM affinity, which is ~10- to 20-fold higher than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S (Fig. 3A and fig. S7) (14). We also formed a complex of ACE2 bound to the 2019-nCoV S ectodomain and observed it by negative-stain EM, which showed that it strongly resembled the complex formed between SARS-CoV S and ACE2 that has been observed at high resolution by cryo-EM (Fig. 3B) (14, 28). The high affinity of 2019-nCoV S for human ACE2 may contribute to the apparent ease with which 2019-nCoV can spread from human to human (1); however, additional studies are needed to investigate this possibility.(A) Surface plasmon resonance sensorgram showing the binding kinetics for human ACE2 and immobilized 2019-nCoV S. Data are shown as black lines, and the best fit of the data to a 1:1 binding model is shown in red. (B) Negative-stain EM 2D class averages of 2019-nCoV S bound by ACE2. Averages have been rotated so that ACE2 is positioned above the 2019-nCoV S protein with respect to the viral membrane. A diagram depicting the ACE2-bound 2019-nCoV S protein is shown (right) with ACE2 in blue and S protein protomers colored tan, pink, and green.The overall structural homology and shared receptor usage between SARS-CoV S and 2019-nCoV S prompted us to test published SARS-CoV RBD-directed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for cross-reactivity to the 2019-nCoV RBD (Fig. 4A). A 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1 fragment (S residues 319 to 591) was recombinantly expressed, and appropriate folding of this construct was validated by measuring ACE2 binding using biolayer interferometry (BLI) (Fig. 4B). Cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV RBD-directed mAbs S230, m396, and 80R was then evaluated by BLI (12, 29\u201331). Despite the relatively high degree of structural homology between the 2019-nCoV RBD and the SARS-CoV RBD, no binding to the 2019-nCoV RBD could be detected for any of the three mAbs at the concentration tested (1 \u03bcM) (Fig. 4C), in contrast to the strong binding that we observed to the SARS-CoV RBD (fig. S8). Although the epitopes of these three antibodies represent a relatively small percentage of the surface area of the 2019-nCoV RBD, the lack of observed binding suggests that SARS-directed mAbs will not necessarily be cross-reactive and that future antibody isolation and therapeutic design efforts will benefit from using 2019-nCoV S proteins as probes.(A) SARS-CoV RBD shown as a white molecular surface (PDB ID: 2AJF), with residues that vary in the 2019-nCoV RBD colored red. The ACE2-binding site is outlined with a black dashed line. (B) Biolayer interferometry sensorgram showing binding to ACE2 by the 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1. Binding data are shown as a black line, and the best fit of the data to a 1:1 binding model is shown in red. (C) Biolayer interferometry to measure cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV RBD-directed antibodies S230, m396, and 80R. Sensor tips with immobilized antibodies were dipped into wells containing 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1, and the resulting data are shown as a black line.The rapid global spread of 2019-nCoV, which prompted the PHEIC declaration by WHO, signals the urgent need for coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics. Knowing the atomic-level structure of the 2019-nCoV spike will allow for additional protein-engineering efforts that could improve antigenicity and protein expression for vaccine development. The structural data will also facilitate the evaluation of 2019-nCoV spike mutations that will occur as the virus undergoes genetic drift and help to define whether those residues have surface exposure and map to sites of known antibody epitopes for other coronavirus spike proteins. In addition, the structure provides assurance that the protein produced by this construct is homogeneous and in the prefusion conformation, which should maintain the most neutralization-sensitive epitopes when used as candidate vaccine antigens or B cell probes for isolating neutralizing human mAbs. Furthermore, the atomic-level detail will enable the design and screening of small molecules with fusion-inhibiting potential. This information will support precision vaccine design and the discovery of antiviral therapeutics, accelerating medical countermeasure development.science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6483/1260/suppl/DC1Materials and MethodsFigs S1 to S8Table S1Movies S1 and S2References (32\u201341)View/request a protocol for this paper from Bio-protocol.This is an article distributed under the terms of the Science Journals Default License.Vol 367, Issue 648313 March 2020Thank you for your interest in spreading the word about Science.NOTE: We only request your email address so that the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it, and that it is not junk mail.

Wrapp et al. determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution structure of the 2019-nCoV trimeric spike protein by cryo\u2013electron microscopy. Using biophysical assays, the authors show that this protein binds at least 10 times more tightly than the corresponding spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2013CoV to their common host cell receptor. They also tested three antibodies known to bind to the SARS-CoV spike protein but did not detect binding to the 2019-nCoV spike protein.

The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure development, we determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also provide biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with higher affinity than does severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV S. Additionally, we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019-nCoV S, suggesting that antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two RBDs.

One of the larger differences between these two structures (although still relatively minor) is the position of the RBDs in their respective down conformations. Whereas the SARS-CoV RBD in the down conformation packs tightly against the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the neighboring protomer, the 2019-nCoV RBD in the down conformation is angled closer to the central cavity of the trimer (Fig. 2B). Despite this observed conformational difference, when the individual structural domains of 2019-nCoV S are aligned to their counterparts from SARS-CoV S, they reflect the high degree of structural homology between the two proteins, with the NTDs, RBDs, subdomains 1 and 2 (SD1 and SD2), and S2 subunits yielding individual RMSD values of 2.6 \u00c5, 3.0 \u00c5, 2.7 \u00c5, and 2.0 \u00c5, respectively (Fig. 2C).(A) Single protomer of 2019-nCoV S with the RBD in the down conformation (left) is shown in ribbons colored according to Fig. 1. A protomer of 2019-nCoV S in the RBD up conformation is shown (center) next to a protomer of SARS-CoV S in the RBD up conformation (right), displayed as ribbons and colored white (PDB ID: 6CRZ). (B) RBDs of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV aligned based on the position of the adjacent NTD from the neighboring protomer. The 2019-nCoV RBD is colored green and the SARS-CoV RBD is colored white. The 2019-nCoV NTD is colored blue. (C) Structural domains from 2019-nCoV S have been aligned to their counterparts from SARS-CoV S as follows: NTD (top left), RBD (top right), SD1 and SD2 (bottom left), and S2 (bottom right).2019-nCoV S shares 98% sequence identity with the S protein from the bat coronavirus RaTG13, with the most notable variation arising from an insertion in the S1/S2 protease cleavage site that results in an \u201cRRAR\u201d furin recognition site in 2019-nCoV (19) rather than the single arginine in SARS-CoV (fig. S5) (20\u201323). Notably, amino acid insertions that create a polybasic furin site in a related position in hemagglutinin proteins are often found in highly virulent avian and human influenza viruses (24). In the structure reported here, the S1/S2 junction is in a disordered, solvent-exposed loop. In addition to this insertion of residues in the S1/S2 junction, 29 variant residues exist between 2019-nCoV S and RaTG13 S, with 17 of these positions mapping to the RBD (figs. S5 and S6). We also analyzed the 61 available 2019-nCoV S sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and found that there were only nine amino acid substitutions among all deposited sequences. Most of these substitutions are relatively conservative and are not expected to have a substantial effect on the structure or function of the 2019-nCoV S protein (fig. S6).Recent reports demonstrating that 2019-nCoV S and SARS-CoV S share the same functional host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (22, 25\u201327), prompted us to quantify the kinetics of this interaction by surface plasmon resonance. ACE2 bound to the 2019-nCoV S ectodomain with ~15 nM affinity, which is ~10- to 20-fold higher than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S (Fig. 3A and fig. S7) (14). We also formed a complex of ACE2 bound to the 2019-nCoV S ectodomain and observed it by negative-stain EM, which showed that it strongly resembled the complex formed between SARS-CoV S and ACE2 that has been observed at high resolution by cryo-EM (Fig. 3B) (14, 28). The high affinity of 2019-nCoV S for human ACE2 may contribute to the apparent ease with which 2019-nCoV can spread from human to human (1); however, additional studies are needed to investigate this possibility.(A) Surface plasmon resonance sensorgram showing the binding kinetics for human ACE2 and immobilized 2019-nCoV S. Data are shown as black lines, and the best fit of the data to a 1:1 binding model is shown in red. (B) Negative-stain EM 2D class averages of 2019-nCoV S bound by ACE2. Averages have been rotated so that ACE2 is positioned above the 2019-nCoV S protein with respect to the viral membrane. A diagram depicting the ACE2-bound 2019-nCoV S protein is shown (right) with ACE2 in blue and S protein protomers colored tan, pink, and green.The overall structural homology and shared receptor usage between SARS-CoV S and 2019-nCoV S prompted us to test published SARS-CoV RBD-directed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for cross-reactivity to the 2019-nCoV RBD (Fig. 4A). A 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1 fragment (S residues 319 to 591) was recombinantly expressed, and appropriate folding of this construct was validated by measuring ACE2 binding using biolayer interferometry (BLI) (Fig. 4B). Cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV RBD-directed mAbs S230, m396, and 80R was then evaluated by BLI (12, 29\u201331). Despite the relatively high degree of structural homology between the 2019-nCoV RBD and the SARS-CoV RBD, no binding to the 2019-nCoV RBD could be detected for any of the three mAbs at the concentration tested (1 \u03bcM) (Fig. 4C), in contrast to the strong binding that we observed to the SARS-CoV RBD (fig. S8). Although the epitopes of these three antibodies represent a relatively small percentage of the surface area of the 2019-nCoV RBD, the lack of observed binding suggests that SARS-directed mAbs will not necessarily be cross-reactive and that future antibody isolation and therapeutic design efforts will benefit from using 2019-nCoV S proteins as probes.(A) SARS-CoV RBD shown as a white molecular surface (PDB ID: 2AJF), with residues that vary in the 2019-nCoV RBD colored red. The ACE2-binding site is outlined with a black dashed line. (B) Biolayer interferometry sensorgram showing binding to ACE2 by the 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1. Binding data are shown as a black line, and the best fit of the data to a 1:1 binding model is shown in red. (C) Biolayer interferometry to measure cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV RBD-directed antibodies S230, m396, and 80R. Sensor tips with immobilized antibodies were dipped into wells containing 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1, and the resulting data are shown as a black line.The rapid global spread of 2019-nCoV, which prompted the PHEIC declaration by WHO, signals the urgent need for coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics. Knowing the atomic-level structure of the 2019-nCoV spike will allow for additional protein-engineering efforts that could improve antigenicity and protein expression for vaccine development. The structural data will also facilitate the evaluation of 2019-nCoV spike mutations that will occur as the virus undergoes genetic drift and help to define whether those residues have surface exposure and map to sites of known antibody epitopes for other coronavirus spike proteins. In addition, the structure provides assurance that the protein produced by this construct is homogeneous and in the prefusion conformation, which should maintain the most neutralization-sensitive epitopes when used as candidate vaccine antigens or B cell probes for isolating neutralizing human mAbs. Furthermore, the atomic-level detail will enable the design and screening of small molecules with fusion-inhibiting potential. This information will support precision vaccine design and the discovery of antiviral therapeutics, accelerating medical countermeasure development.science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6483/1260/suppl/DC1Materials and MethodsFigs S1 to S8Table S1Movies S1 and S2References (32\u201341)View/request a protocol for this paper from Bio-protocol.This is an article distributed under the terms of the Science Journals Default License.Vol 367, Issue 648313 March 2020Thank you for your interest in spreading the word about Science.NOTE: We only request your email address so that the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it, and that it is not junk mail.

The virus binds to host cells through its trimeric spike glycoprotein, making this protein a key target for potential therapies and diagnostics. Wrapp et al. determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution structure of the 2019-nCoV trimeric spike protein by cryo\u2013electron microscopy. Using biophysical assays, the authors show that this protein binds at least 10 times more tightly than the corresponding spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2013CoV to their common host cell receptor. They also tested three antibodies known to bind to the SARS-CoV spike protein but did not detect binding to the 2019-nCoV spike protein. These studies provide valuable information to guide the development of medical counter-measures for 2019-nCoV.Science, this issue p. 1260The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) represents a pandemic threat that has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure development, we determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also provide biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with higher affinity than does severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV S. Additionally, we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019-nCoV S, suggesting that antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two RBDs. The structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable the rapid development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to address the ongoing public health crisis.The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has recently emerged as a human pathogen in the city of Wuhan in China\u2019s Hubei province, causing fever, severe respiratory illness, and pneumonia\u2014a disease recently named COVID-19 (1, 2). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 16 February 2020, there had been >51,000 confirmed cases globally, leading to at least 1600 deaths. The emerging pathogen was rapidly characterized as a new member of the betacoronavirus genus, closely related to several bat coronaviruses and to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (3, 4). Compared with SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV appears to be more readily transmitted from human to human, spreading to multiple continents and leading to the WHO\u2019s declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 (1, 5, 6).2019-nCoV makes use of a densely glycosylated spike (S) protein to gain entry into host cells. The S protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein that exists in a metastable prefusion conformation that undergoes a substantial structural rearrangement to fuse the viral membrane with the host cell membrane (7, 8). This process is triggered when the S1 subunit binds to a host cell receptor. Receptor binding destabilizes the prefusion trimer, resulting in shedding of the S1 subunit and transition of the S2 subunit to a stable postfusion conformation (9). To engage a host cell receptor, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 undergoes hinge-like conformational movements that transiently hide or expose the determinants of receptor binding. These two states are referred to as the \u201cdown\u201d conformation and the \u201cup\u201d conformation, where down corresponds to the receptor-inaccessible state and up corresponds to the receptor-accessible state, which is thought to be less stable (10\u201313). Because of the indispensable function of the S protein, it represents a target for antibody-mediated neutralization, and characterization of the prefusion S structure would provide atomic-level information to guide vaccine design and development.Based on the first reported genome sequence of 2019-nCoV (4), we expressed ectodomain residues 1 to 1208 of 2019-nCoV S, adding two stabilizing proline mutations in the C-terminal S2 fusion machinery using a previous stabilization strategy that proved effective for other betacoronavirus S proteins (11, 14). Figure 1A shows the domain organization of the expression construct, and figure S1 shows the purification process. We obtained ~0.5 mg/liter of the recombinant prefusion-stabilized S ectodomain from FreeStyle 293 cells and purified the protein to homogeneity by affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography (fig. S1). Cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM) grids were prepared using this purified, fully glycosylated S protein, and preliminary screening revealed a high particle density with little aggregation near the edges of the holes.(A) Schematic of 2019-nCoV S primary structure colored by domain. Domains that were excluded from the ectodomain expression construct or could not be visualized in the final map are colored white. SS, signal sequence; S2\u2032, S2\u2032 protease cleavage site; FP, fusion peptide; HR1, heptad repeat 1; CH, central helix; CD, connector domain; HR2, heptad repeat 2; TM, transmembrane domain; CT, cytoplasmic tail. Arrows denote protease cleavage sites. (B) Side and top views of the prefusion structure of the 2019-nCoV S protein with a single RBD in the up conformation. The two RBD down protomers are shown as cryo-EM density in either white or gray and the RBD up protomer is shown in ribbons colored corresponding to the schematic in (A).After collecting and processing 3207 micrograph movies, we obtained a 3.5-\u00c5-resolution three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of an asymmetrical trimer in which a single RBD was observed in the up conformation. (Fig. 1B, fig. S2, and table S1). Because of the small size of the RBD (~21 kDa), the asymmetry of this conformation was not readily apparent until ab initio 3D reconstruction and classification were performed (Fig. 1B and fig. S3). By using the 3D variability feature in cryoSPARC v2 (15), we observed breathing of the S1 subunits as the RBD underwent a hinge-like movement, which likely contributed to the relatively poor local resolution of S1 compared with the more stable S2 subunit (movies S1 and S2). This seemingly stochastic RBD movement has been captured during structural characterization of the closely related betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as the more distantly related alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (10, 11, 13, 16). The observation of this phenomenon in 2019-nCoV S suggests that it shares the same mechanism of triggering that is thought to be conserved among the Coronaviridae, wherein receptor binding to exposed RBDs leads to an unstable three-RBD up conformation that results in shedding of S1 and refolding of S2 (11, 12).Because the S2 subunit appeared to be a symmetric trimer, we performed a 3D refinement imposing C3 symmetry, resulting in a 3.2-\u00c5-resolution map with excellent density for the S2 subunit. Using both maps, we built most of the 2019-nCoV S ectodomain, including glycans at 44 of the 66 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimer (fig. S4). Our final model spans S residues 27 to 1146, with several flexible loops omitted. Like all previously reported coronavirus S ectodomain structures, the density for 2019-nCoV S begins to fade after the connector domain, reflecting the flexibility of the heptad repeat 2 domain in the prefusion conformation (fig. S4A) (13, 16\u201318).The overall structure of 2019-nCoV S resembles that of SARS-CoV S, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 3.8 \u00c5 over 959 C\u03b1 atoms (Fig. 2A). One of the larger differences between these two structures (although still relatively minor) is the position of the RBDs in their respective down conformations. Whereas the SARS-CoV RBD in the down conformation packs tightly against the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the neighboring protomer, the 2019-nCoV RBD in the down conformation is angled closer to the central cavity of the trimer (Fig. 2B). Despite this observed conformational difference, when the individual structural domains of 2019-nCoV S are aligned to their counterparts from SARS-CoV S, they reflect the high degree of structural homology between the two proteins, with the NTDs, RBDs, subdomains 1 and 2 (SD1 and SD2), and S2 subunits yielding individual RMSD values of 2.6 \u00c5, 3.0 \u00c5, 2.7 \u00c5, and 2.0 \u00c5, respectively (Fig. 2C).(A) Single protomer of 2019-nCoV S with the RBD in the down conformation (left) is shown in ribbons colored according to Fig. 1. A protomer of 2019-nCoV S in the RBD up conformation is shown (center) next to a protomer of SARS-CoV S in the RBD up conformation (right), displayed as ribbons and colored white (PDB ID: 6CRZ). (B) RBDs of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV aligned based on the position of the adjacent NTD from the neighboring protomer. The 2019-nCoV RBD is colored green and the SARS-CoV RBD is colored white.

(C) Structural domains from 2019-nCoV S have been aligned to their counterparts from SARS-CoV S as follows: NTD (top left), RBD (top right), SD1 and SD2 (bottom left), and S2 (bottom right).2019-nCoV S shares 98% sequence identity with the S protein from the bat coronavirus RaTG13, with the most notable variation arising from an insertion in the S1/S2 protease cleavage site that results in an \u201cRRAR\u201d furin recognition site in 2019-nCoV (19) rather than the single arginine in SARS-CoV (fig. S5) (20\u201323). Notably, amino acid insertions that create a polybasic furin site in a related position in hemagglutinin proteins are often found in highly virulent avian and human influenza viruses (24). In the structure reported here, the S1/S2 junction is in a disordered, solvent-exposed loop. In addition to this insertion of residues in the S1/S2 junction, 29 variant residues exist between 2019-nCoV S and RaTG13 S, with 17 of these positions mapping to the RBD (figs. S5 and S6). We also analyzed the 61 available 2019-nCoV S sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and found that there were only nine amino acid substitutions among all deposited sequences. Most of these substitutions are relatively conservative and are not expected to have a substantial effect on the structure or function of the 2019-nCoV S protein (fig. S6).Recent reports demonstrating that 2019-nCoV S and SARS-CoV S share the same functional host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (22, 25\u201327), prompted us to quantify the kinetics of this interaction by surface plasmon resonance. ACE2 bound to the 2019-nCoV S ectodomain with ~15 nM affinity, which is ~10- to 20-fold higher than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S (Fig. 3A and fig. S7) (14). We also formed a complex of ACE2 bound to the 2019-nCoV S ectodomain and observed it by negative-stain EM, which showed that it strongly resembled the complex formed between SARS-CoV S and ACE2 that has been observed at high resolution by cryo-EM (Fig. 3B) (14, 28). The high affinity of 2019-nCoV S for human ACE2 may contribute to the apparent ease with which 2019-nCoV can spread from human to human (1); however, additional studies are needed to investigate this possibility.(A) Surface plasmon resonance sensorgram showing the binding kinetics for human ACE2 and immobilized 2019-nCoV S. Data are shown as black lines, and the best fit of the data to a 1:1 binding model is shown in red. (B) Negative-stain EM 2D class averages of 2019-nCoV S bound by ACE2. Averages have been rotated so that ACE2 is positioned above the 2019-nCoV S protein with respect to the viral membrane. A diagram depicting the ACE2-bound 2019-nCoV S protein is shown (right) with ACE2 in blue and S protein protomers colored tan, pink, and green.The overall structural homology and shared receptor usage between SARS-CoV S and 2019-nCoV S prompted us to test published SARS-CoV RBD-directed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for cross-reactivity to the 2019-nCoV RBD (Fig. 4A). A 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1 fragment (S residues 319 to 591) was recombinantly expressed, and appropriate folding of this construct was validated by measuring ACE2 binding using biolayer interferometry (BLI) (Fig. 4B). Cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV RBD-directed mAbs S230, m396, and 80R was then evaluated by BLI (12, 29\u201331). Despite the relatively high degree of structural homology between the 2019-nCoV RBD and the SARS-CoV RBD, no binding to the 2019-nCoV RBD could be detected for any of the three mAbs at the concentration tested (1 \u03bcM) (Fig. 4C), in contrast to the strong binding that we observed to the SARS-CoV RBD (fig. S8). Although the epitopes of these three antibodies represent a relatively small percentage of the surface area of the 2019-nCoV RBD, the lack of observed binding suggests that SARS-directed mAbs will not necessarily be cross-reactive and that future antibody isolation and therapeutic design efforts will benefit from using 2019-nCoV S proteins as probes.(A) SARS-CoV RBD shown as a white molecular surface (PDB ID: 2AJF), with residues that vary in the 2019-nCoV RBD colored red. The ACE2-binding site is outlined with a black dashed line. (B) Biolayer interferometry sensorgram showing binding to ACE2 by the 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1. Binding data are shown as a black line, and the best fit of the data to a 1:1 binding model is shown in red. (C) Biolayer interferometry to measure cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV RBD-directed antibodies S230, m396, and 80R. Sensor tips with immobilized antibodies were dipped into wells containing 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1, and the resulting data are shown as a black line.The rapid global spread of 2019-nCoV, which prompted the PHEIC declaration by WHO, signals the urgent need for coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics. Knowing the atomic-level structure of the 2019-nCoV spike will allow for additional protein-engineering efforts that could improve antigenicity and protein expression for vaccine development. The structural data will also facilitate the evaluation of 2019-nCoV spike mutations that will occur as the virus undergoes genetic drift and help to define whether those residues have surface exposure and map to sites of known antibody epitopes for other coronavirus spike proteins. In addition, the structure provides assurance that the protein produced by this construct is homogeneous and in the prefusion conformation, which should maintain the most neutralization-sensitive epitopes when used as candidate vaccine antigens or B cell probes for isolating neutralizing human mAbs. Furthermore, the atomic-level detail will enable the design and screening of small molecules with fusion-inhibiting potential. This information will support precision vaccine design and the discovery of antiviral therapeutics, accelerating medical countermeasure development.science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6483/1260/suppl/DC1Materials and MethodsFigs S1 to S8Table S1Movies S1 and S2References (32\u201341)View/request a protocol for this paper from Bio-protocol.This is an article distributed under the terms of the Science Journals Default License.Vol 367, Issue 648313 March 2020Thank you for your interest in spreading the word about Science.NOTE: We only request your email address so that the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it, and that it is not junk mail.

            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.Qatar's Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) yesterday confirmed a new MERS-CoV case in a 65-year-old man, the fourth case recorded in Qatar since December.In a news release, the MOPH said the man has several chronic diseases and is hospitalized to receive care for his MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) infection. Officials said they are taking all necessary precautions to prevent the disease from spreading.Officials did not say whether the man had traveled recently, had recent contact with camels, or had other risk factors. They also did not say where the man is from or where he is hospitalized.Qatar officials confirmed three MERS cases in late December 2019. Before that, the country had not reported a case since 2017.The World Health Organization said in its latest monthly update that, since 2012, it has received reports of 2,499 MERS-CoV cases, at least 861 of them fatal. The vast majority of these cases were in Saudi Arabia.Feb 18 Qatar MOPH news release Dec 27, 2019, CIDRAP News scan on earlier casesYesterday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) both announced an end to their investigations into a Salmonella outbreak first identified in December tied to cut fruit produced by Tailor Cut Produce of North Brunswick, New Jersey.The CDC said officials confirmed 69 new cases recorded since its Jan 2 update, for a total of 165 cases reported since early December 2019 in 14 states. Seventy-three patients were hospitalized, and there were no deaths. Illness-onset dates ranged from Nov 7, 2019, to Jan 11, 2020.\"Illnesses were reported from states where Tailor Cut Produce distributed cut fruit, including Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. Most ill people from the other 10 states reported traveling to at least one of these 4 states in the week before their illness started,\" the CDC said.On Dec 7, Tailor Cut Produce recalled its Fruit Luau cut fruit mix as well as cut honeydew melon, cantaloupe, and pineapple products because they had the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella bacteria.  Feb 18 CDC update Feb 18 FDA reportA follow-up study of 61 people in China who survived H7N9 avian flu hospitalizations in three of the country's five outbreak waves found persistent lung damage and ongoing pulmonary dysfunction. A team from China published its findings yesterday in EClinicalMedicine.The survivors were from five provinces and Beijing, and between Aug 2013 and Sep 2018, researchers conducted follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months after illness onset. For a subset of patients, assessments were repeated at 18 and 64 months. The medical exam included dyspnea assessment, chest auscultation, pulmonary function testing, and chest computed tomography (CT).The cumulative rate of pulmonary dysfunction was 38.5% at the 18-month follow-up visit and 78.2% for chest CT abnormalities, also at the 18-month follow-up visit. Pulmonary function tests showed that 38.1% has a restrictive pattern of lung disease at the 3-month visit, which slowly resolved. The researchers observed an obstructive pattern in 14.3% at the 3-month visit, which persisted for about a year. They also found that abnormalities on chest CT persisted after pulmonary function improved.The investigators said the pulmonary problems they found persisted longer than what was reported for patients hospitalized with pandemic or seasonal flu. The team concluded that the findings add to the understanding of H7N9 disease severity and underscore the importance of long-term follow-up studies to gauge the impact of infections with influenza A viruses.Since early 2013, China experienced five H7N9 waves, which resulted in 1,567 illnesses, at least 615 of them fatal, according to the WHO.

            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.As the COVID-19 outbreak grows in China and abroad, new studies attempt to answer questions on how the virus is shed and the range of clinical outcomes, with two studies indicating that shedding\u2014and therefore transmission\u2014likely occurs via multiple routes.Currently, testing for and confirmation of infection with COVID-19 is conducted via oral swabs. But in a study published in Emerging Microbes & Infections, Chinese scientists report evidence of an oral-fecal transmission route for COVID-19 viruses and show that, in hospitalized patients, viral RNA was found in anal swabs and in blood samples.The study was conducted in a Wuhan, China, hospital, with samples collected from 178 patients. The study authors found viral nucleotide in anal swabs or blood even when it was not detected in oral swabs, especially in patients who had been receiving supportive care for several days.The results also showed that the timing of positive swabs changed. On the first day of illness, 80% of oral swabs were positive in a small group of patients, but by day 5, 75% of anal swabs were positive for COVID-19 virual RNA, and only 50% of oral swabs were still positive in the same patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19.\"These data suggested a shift from more oral positive during early period (as indicated by antibody titres) to more anal positive during later period might happen,\" the authors said.The results of the study are the first to show COVID-19 could be transmitted via respiratory, fecal-oral, or body fluid routes, the authors say. They also warn that a patient with negative oral swabs after several days of illness may still be capable of transmitting the virus.In a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control, authors describe how they isolated the virus from a stool sample of a patient with COVID-19\"Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are considered to be the most important routes of transmission of 2019-nCoV, but do not fully account for the occurrence of all coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, previously known as novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), and the reasons for the rapid spread of this virus,\" they write.The finding suggests stool can contaminate hands, food, water, and, as with the other study, it points to multiple routes of transmission.Today in The BMJ, Chinese scientists looked at the clinical findings of 62 COVID-19 patients from seven hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. None of the patients died, and only one patient was admitted to the intensive care unit.Of the 62 patients, 48 (77%) presented with a fever, 50 (81%) had a cough, 35 (56%) had a productive cough, 32 (52%) reported muscle pain or fatigue, and 21 (34%) had a headache. Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on admission, the authors said.The authors said that, compared with patients in Wuhan, the patients seen in Zhejiang had relatively mild symptoms. None of the patients had exposure to the Wuhan seafood market linked to the origin of the virus, and all had contracted the disease front another infected person.Patients who experienced symptoms for the more than 10 days were more likely to have underlying health issues.The authors also provided a timeline for infection: \"Among 56 patients who could provide the exact date of close contact with someone with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, the median incubation period from exposure to symptoms was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days). The median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2.0 (1.0-4.3) days.\"SARS-CoV-2 is another name for the COVID-19 virus.In a study from The Lancet Infectious Diseases, meanwhile, investigators detailed the first case of COVID-19 in a Vietnamese woman who acquired the virus in China. The woman lived in Wuhan for business for 2 months in December and January and did not report visiting the Wuhan seafood market or having close contact with any person with influenza-like symptoms.The woman lived with two other Vietnamese colleagues in Wuhan, and they also developed COVID-19 upon return to Vietnam. After being admitted to the hospital with fever and respiratory symptoms, the woman recovered within 9 days.\"21 people with direct contact with this patient were also isolated. Until February 6, none of these individuals had developed symptoms. As the patient's two colleagues tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, this suggested transmission via respiratory droplets,\" the authors concluded.Get CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now\u00bbUnrestricted financial support provided byGrant support for ASP provided byBecome an underwriter\u00bbCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.China's death toll in its COVID-19 outbreak passed 2,000 today, as Iran reported its first two cases\u2014both fatal\u2014and the number of local cases grew in Japan, Singapore, and South Korea.Also, 79 more people from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan tested positive for the virus, with quarantine ending for many of those were not infected, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel watch for Hong Kong.China's National Health Commission today reported 1,739 new cases, down from the 1,886 new infections reported yesterday. The country's overall outbreak total stands at 74,185. It reported 136 more deaths lifting the outbreak's fatality count to 2,004. And health officials added 236 new serious cases, raising that total to 11,977.An international joint mission led by the World Health Organization (WHO) in its fourth day of meetings in the country, where the experts are meeting with Chinese officials to learn more about the outbreak and to offer their assistance.In other outbreak developments, China changed its COVID-19 case definition again, and instead of counting clinically diagnosed cases as confirmed infections, it will classify them as suspected cases, according to a government statement.Earlier today, Iran's health ministry today reported the country's first two COVID-19 cases, which it said were preliminary positives that were undergoing further testing. It said the cases were detected in Qom, a holy city with a population of about 1.3 million located about 78 miles south of Tehran.Then later today, media reports, citing Iran's health ministry, said the two patients died from the disease. Few details were available about the patients, other than that they were both elderly and had acute lung infections, Al Jazeera reported.Iran is the third country in the Middle East to report COVID-19 cases and the first in the region to report fatal cases. The United Arab Emirates and Egypt are other countries that have reported cases.Japan's health ministry today reported seven new cases, one of them asymptomatic, raising the country's total to 73. Three cases, including the asymptomatic one, are from Wakayama prefecture, three are from Tokyo, and one is from Aichi prefecture.One of the patients from Wakayama prefecture is the son of a doctor who worked at Saiseikai Arida Hospital, whose illness was confirmed on Feb 14, Jiji Press reported yesterday. The other two are a nurse who worked on the Diamond Princess medical assistance team and a patient who shared a room with a previously identified \u00a0COVID-19 patient.In Singapore, the health ministry today reported three more cases, one linked to a known church cluster, one linked to a different church cluster, and one with a still-undetermined exposure source. The country now has 84 cases. Contact links have been found for all but eight locally transmitted cases.Elsewhere, South Korea today reported 20 new cases, 14 of them linked to church services in the city of Daegu, Reuters reported yesterday. The confirmations bring the country's overall total to 51. Citing a statement from the Korea Centers for Disease Control, it said the country's 31st patient, a 61-year-old woman, is linked to infections in at least 15 people who attended church services with her, plus a contact at the facility where she was hospitalized. Health officials have said the cluster of cases marks a super spreading event.Also today, Japan's health ministry today reported that 79 more people on the Diamond Princess have tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, of whom 68 are asymptomatic. The new cases raise the total to 621.The quarantined cruise ship has been in Yokohama port since Feb 3.In related developments, hundreds of passengers who tested negative have started leaving the ship, now that their 14-day quarantine period is over, according to a BBC reported today, which also cited a Japanese expert who visited the ship and found inadequate infection control.Yesterday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Diamond Princess passengers and crew are restricted from entering the United States for at least 14 days after they leave the ship, due to ongoing risk. It added though Japan took extraordinary efforts to quarantine the ship, they may not have been enough to prevent transmission among people on the ship.The cruise ship company said today that Canada, Australia, and Hong Kong are coordinating charter flights for their citizens, which are expected to arrive today. All will be subject to 14-day quarantines and COVID-19 testing when they arrive home. For those not taking evacuation flights, Japan's health ministry is requiring a negative test before individuals exit the ship.In a related development, the World Health Organization (WHO) today shared more details about the Westerdam cruise ship that was recently allowed to disembark in Cambodia, efforts that were halted after an American passenger tested positive for the virus after traveling on the Malaysia. It said 18 of 2,257 people were sick during the voyage, but samples were taken from 20 who had flulike symptoms, and all were negative for the virus before the passengers were allowed to disembark.Temperature screening before the passengers left the ship found no people with fever.In response to the positive test in the American woman, health screening and testing for COVID-19 are under way for all people still on the ship or are still in Cambodia. It said the WHO, CDC, Pasteur Institute, and related embassies are on the ground in Sihanoukville where the ship is located and in Phnom Penh.The WHO said today in its daily update that over the past 24 hours it has received 120 new reports of COVID-19 cases outside China from 25 countries, 3 of them fatal. However, 542 of those are from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Excluding the ship cluster, Singapore has the highest number of cases outside of China, followed by Japan.The CDC today posted a travel watch, the lowest level that urges people to practice usual precautions, for Hong Kong, the second location to have an advisory for COVID-19.It said the ongoing outbreak has spread to Hong Kong, where multiple instances of community spread have been reported. In an update today, Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection said 62 cases have been confirmed so far, including 2 new ones today.The administrative region has imposed a quarantine for China mainland travelers and has urged people to take social distancing steps. Today the CHP announced enhanced surveillance and testing for people who have fever and respiratory symptoms at outpatient clinics and hospital emergency departments to help detect mild cases and provide a better understanding of the epidemiological situation.Get CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now\u00bbUnrestricted financial support provided byGrant support for ASP provided byBecome an underwriter\u00bbCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

            "headline": "Hospitals across the US prepare for coronavirus outbreak to become global pandemic",
            "main_text": "Keep Me Logged In\"This is the time to open up your pandemic plans and see that things are in order,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, a top official of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, urged hospitals last week as an outbreak of a deadly new coronavirus ravaged much of China.\"For instance,\" she continued, health-care providers need to plan for a \"surge at a hospital, the ability to provide personal protective equipment for your workforce, the administrative controls and so forth that you might put place in a health care setting.\"Schuchat's warning came as U.S. and world health officials increasingly sound the alarm of a possible pandemic outbreak of the deadly new coronavirus that has killed more than 2,100 people in China in the last seven weeks.The COVID-19 epidemic in China has not yet met world health officials' designation of a global pandemic that spreads far and wide throughout the world. While it has spread to more than two dozen countries, international health officials say there's very little transmission on local levels outside of China right now. But they've warned that could quickly change. The virus is proving to be far more contagious than the flu, having spread from 300 people in mid-January to more than 75,700 as of Thursday morning.While a majority of those cases are in China \u2014 with just 15 confirmed in the U.S. \u2014 the CDC has been working with the health-care sector to prepare for the virus to \"take a foothold in the U.S,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters Feb. 12.\"At some point, we are likely to see community spread in the U.S. or in other countries,\" she warned.U.S. hospitals from San Diego to New York are taking heed.The threat of the new virus comes at an already busy time for most U.S. hospitals. Another serious respiratory illness, the seasonal flu, is at its peak in the United States, with more than 26 million cases and many hospitals stretched thin. A larger spread of the new virus across the U.S. could overwhelm emergency rooms and quickly cause supply shortages of some crucial medical supplies, according to half a dozen interviews with doctors, U.S. hospitals and health systems.Hospital staff at San Diego-based Scripps Health are consolidating medical supplies such as masks, gloves and gowns and have ordered backup reserves in case of a widespread outbreak in the United State, said Dr. Ghazala Sharieff, chief medical officer.Health-care workers are being taught how to reuse N95 respirator masks, most often used to control exposures to infections, in case of wide-spread shortages, she said.Patients presenting flu-like symptoms are also being asked on a questionnaire about their recent travel history, including whether they've been to China in the last 14 days or have been in close contact with anyone who has, she said.\"We don't know what happens next, but we are prepared,\" Sharieff said. \"We are fine with supplies right now but we don't want to get caught without supplies.\"So far, 26 people have been screened for possible exposure to the coronavirus that emerged from Wuhan, China, over a month ago, Sharieff said. One of the patients actually met the qualifications for having the virus before further testing came back negative, she said. Early during the outbreak, patients were coming in concerned they may have been exposed to the virus,but that has since tapered off, she said.\"I think we've done a good job educating people,\" she said. \"When we first started, there were people in the community saying they were worried that they stood next to someone at the airport who had a mask on. ... I think they realized that that is probably a little bit of panic on their behalf.\"At Northside Hospital, a network of hospitals and medical facilities in Atlanta, the staff is continuously monitoring the coronavirus outbreak, according to a spokesperson.The hospital said if a patient has any clinical symptoms and has recently traveled from Wuhan, or if they have been in close contact with a person who is under investigation for the virus, they will be masked and taken directly to an airborne isolation room, where they will remain while in the hospital.\"Infection control and prevention measures are always a priority,\" spokeswoman Katherine Watson said.Staff at NYU Langone Health in New York City has designated the new virus as a \"level 1\" priority.\"A big part of this level is communication,\" said Dr. Jennifer Lighter, hospital epidemiologist there.\"We are trying to communicate to NYU staff and patients in our medical center how to best protect themselves from the flu or COVID-19,\" Lighter said. \"That's just general info like basic hand hygiene, sneezing into the end of your elbow and practicing safe distance from someone who is sick.\"NYU is also preparing for a level 2 or 3 scenario, she added, where there is transmission in the city and it begins to impact hospital operations. The health-care system has implemented a conservation plan and medical supplies, especially respirator masks, are only given to staff as needed, she said.\"If a team needed more, they would have to be infection-prevention approved or manager approved before someone would get more,\" she said, adding staff is already feeling the brunt of the flu season.The hospital is also recommending patients with more mild symptoms to stay at home, she said. The hospital has been ramping up its virtual urgent care, including training doctors and purchasing more iPads and other machines. \"If you're shortness of breath, obviously, please come in,\" Lighter said.Dr. Robert Citronberg, director of infectious diseases with Advocate Health Care in Illinois, said the risk of the coronavirus becoming widespread in the U.S. remains \"low,\" citing the country's strong health-care infrastructure.But that doesn't mean health-care workers are complacent, he said. Citronberg, who works out of Park Ridge, northwest of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, said there's always the potential of someone getting off a plane with exposure to the virus.\"We certainly are not complacent about that possibility,\" he said. \"We are really trying to reinforce with our front-line staff particularly that you still got to be alert, you've still got to be on your toes.\" Citronberg said,. He added that the health-care system doesn't have any \"imminent problems\" with medical supplies such as masks and gloves because it already stocked up on them due to the flu season.They are asking every patient whether they've recently traveled to China or had contact with anyone who has been there. Advocate has also increased its use of telemedicine over the last few years and that may be useful in handling a outbreak, he said.Got a confidential news tip?

            "headline": "Study raises questions about broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia",
            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.A large study of patients hospitalized for pneumonia suggests that a treatment strategy designed to account for patients with antibiotic-resistant infections should be reconsidered.The study, published this week in JAMA Internal Medicine, found that pneumonia patients who received empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics had a higher risk of death compared with those who received standard antibiotic therapy. They also had a higher risk of kidney injury, along with Clostridioides difficile and other secondary infections.The authors of the study say the findings are a good example of how efforts to improve clinical outcomes for patients can sometimes lead clinicians to adopt practices that aren't backed by solid evidence. In the case of pneumonia, concerns about possible infection with resistant organisms like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa has led to a strategy of early broad-spectrum antibiotics for certain patients.\"The underlying assumption of this approach is that the benefit of more potent antibiotics during the empirical phase exceeds the harms,\" they write. \"Our study questions this assumption.\"The strategy goes back to the 2005 guidelines from the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America for treatment of adults who have community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Those guidelines recommended that pneumonia patients who lived in nursing homes or had been in the hospital in the previous 90 days should be labeled as having healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics like vancomycin or piperacillin-tazobactam to cover for the possibility that the pneumonia was caused by MRSA or Pseudomonas.Subsequently, a 2015 study of patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system found that, after those guidelines were published, a substantial shift in treatment of CAP patients occurred, with the proportion of vancomycin prescribing rising from 16% in 2006 to 31% in 2010 and piperacillin-tazobactam prescribing jumping from 16% to 27%. This shift occurred even though less than 5% of patients in the study had resistant bacteria detected.But it's unclear which patients, and how many, are benefitting from the use of more potent antibiotics.To get a better sense of how empiric broad-spectrum therapy is affecting clinical outcomes in CAP patients, a team led by investigators from the VA Salt Lake City Health Care System and the University of Utah conducted a retrospective cohort study of all CAP hospitalizations in the VA health care system from 2008 through 2013.They specifically looked at the 30-day mortality rate associated with three empirical treatment regimens: standard antibiotics alone, standard antibiotics plus anti-MRSA therapy, and anti-MRSA therapy without standard antibiotics. Secondary outcomes included development of kidney injury and secondary infections with C difficile, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species, or gram-negative bacteria.Of the 88,605 CAP patients analyzed in the study, empirical anti-MRSA antibiotics were administered to 33,632 (38%), with 13,528 receiving empirical anti-MRSA therapy with standard antibiotics and 20,104 receiving anti-MRSA therapy without standard antibiotics. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 10% (8,929 patients). Only 2% of the patients (2,154) had MRSA detected by clinical culture.After adjusting for comorbidities and other patient characteristics that might affect treatment regimens and risk of 30-day mortality, the analysis found that empirical anti-MRSA treatment plus standard therapy was significantly associated with greater 30-day mortality compared with standard therapy alone (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 1.5), as was anti-MRSA treatment with non-standard therapy (aRR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.4 to 1.6).Analysis of secondary outcomes showed that patients receiving anti-MRSA treatment and standard therapy also had a higher risk of kidney injury (aRR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3 to 1.5), secondary C difficile infections (aRR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 1.9), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp (aRR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.3), and secondary gram-negative bacteria detection (aRR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.8).In addition, similar associations between anti-MRSA therapy and higher 30-day mortality were found when the researchers looked at sub-groups of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (aRR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.5), those with a high risk for MRSA (aRR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.4), and those with MRSA detected on surveillance testing (aRR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 1.9). There was no significant difference in risk of 30-day mortality, however, for patients with a MRSA-positive culture (aRR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.4).\"These findings, which were robust to multiple methods of analysis, contribute to a growing body of evidence that raises questions surrounding widespread empirical use of extended-spectrum antibiotics in patients with community-acquired pneumonia,\" the authors write.For Michael Klompas, MD, MPH, a professor of population medicine at Harvard Medical School and author of an editorial that accompanies the study, the data from this analysis and other studies make a compelling argument that broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia should be avoided until it's clear they are needed.\"The messages are clear: empirical coverage with broad-spectrum agents is not indicated in most patients being treated for pneumonia, and if the diagnosis of pneumonia is uncertain, there is no harm and likely some benefit in taking some time to acquire more diagnostic clarity before treating (such as further imaging, laboratory testing, treating concurrent conditions, and/or observation), so long as the patient is clinically stable,\" he writes.Valerie Vaughn, MD, a hospitalist at the University of Michigan's academic medical center who was not involved in the study, says the findings are significant because there's long been a concern among clinicians that CAP patients are being overtreated, given the fact that MRSA is still a very rare cause of pneumonia.\"There was this growing sense that we'd swung the pendulum too far, and were very focused on trying to make sure that we didn't miss any patients with MRSA, so anybody that had a risk for MRSA we treated with vancomycin,\" Vaughn said. \"We really focused on the risk of missing patients that might have MRSA, and less about the potential harms of overtreating what is a much larger number of patients who don't have MRSA pneumonia.\"Vaughn hopes that this study, along with revamped CAP guidelines published in October 2019, will spur changes in the how clinicians treat these patients. The new guidelines support abandoning the term HCAP, and recommend that clinicians treat patient empirically for MRSA or Pseudomonas only if locally validated risk factors for either pathogen are present.\"This is definitely something that's been in the front of our minds, the fact that we need to rethink the doctrine that more is better, and that the benefit of catching resistant organisms early in a few patients outweighs the harms of antibiotic side effects in the many who end up not having resistant organisms, or actually may not have pneumonia at all,\" she said.Vaughn said the next step for reducing unnecessary antibiotic treatment for pneumonia, which is often overdiagnosed, is development of better diagnostic tools.\"We still don't have a good way of diagnosing pneumonia, or diagnosing pathogens for patients who do have pneumonia,\" she said. \"We need better diagnostics tools, and better ways of using those tools.\"See also:Oct 2, 2019, CIDRAP News story \"Guidance on community-acquired pneumonia updated\"Get CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now\u00bbUnrestricted financial support provided byGrant support for ASP provided byBecome an underwriter\u00bbCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

Credit: NIAID-RMLThe Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota announced today it has launched an online CIDRAP COVID-19 Resource Center\u00a0that provides a wealth of information for public health experts, business preparedness leaders, government officials, and the public regarding the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19.The resource center features extensive original content from CIDRAP and aggregates the most useful information from diverse perspectives and expertise, including:COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The virus is spreading rapidly in China and has caused illnesses in at least 25 other countries, including the U.S. The organism is a member of a family of viruses that not only causes the common cold, but other, more serious, respiratory illnesses. Two examples include SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which emerged in 2002, and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), which appeared in 2012. Many of the early COVID-19 infections might have been linked to animal exposure, but the disease is now readily spreading among people. Because the virus is new, information is evolving by the hour.\u201cThe goal is to make the CIDRAP COVID-19 Resource Center a comprehensive, authoritative, one-stop resource on COVID-19, complete with relevant information for public health professionals; members of the media; and international, national, and local policymakers or elected officials,\u201d said Michael T. Osterholm, University of Minnesota Regents Professor, McKnight Presidential Endowed Chair in Public Health and director of CIDRAP. \u201cCOVID-19 is a global public health threat we cannot afford to take lightly.\u201dThe COVID-19 Resource Center is made possible with support from the University of Minnesota Office of the Vice President for Research and the Bentson Foundation.###About the Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyThe Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy is a global leader in addressing public health preparedness and emerging infectious disease response.

            "main_text": "CDC provides recommendations for international travel, including guidance on when to consider postponing or canceling travel. Most of the time, this guidance is provided through travel health notices and is based on the potential health risks associated with traveling to a certain destination.Travel health notices are designated as Level 1, 2, or 3, depending on the situation in that destination. (See below for what each level means). A list of destinations with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) travel health notices is available at www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html.CDC also recommends all travelers, defer all cruise travel worldwide. This is particularly important for older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions.If you do travel, take the following steps to help reduce your chances of getting sick:Make sure you are up to date with your routine vaccinations, including measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine.The COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving situation and CDC guidance is reviewed daily and updated frequently.Yes. Airport layovers in international destinations with a level 3 travel health notice are included in CDC\u2019s recommendation to avoid nonessential travel. If a layover is unavoidable, CDC recommends you not leave the airport. Even if you don\u2019t leave the airport during your layover, you may still be subject to screening and monitoring when entering the United States.A layover is anytime you exit a plane when traveling to your final destination.Because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes, most viruses and other germs do not spread easily. Although the risk of infection on an airplane is low, try to avoid contact with sick passengers and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.For more information: Exposure Risk During TravelUnder current federal regulations, pilots must report all illnesses and deaths to CDC before arriving to a US destination. According to CDC disease protocols, if a sick traveler is considered to be a public health risk, CDC works with local and state health departments and international public health agencies to contact passengers and crew exposed to that sick traveler.Be sure to give the airline your current contact information when booking your ticket so you can be notified if you are exposed to a sick traveler on a flight.For more information: Contact InvestigationCDC recommends all travelers, particularly older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions defer all cruise ship travel worldwide. Recent reports of COVID-19 on cruise ships highlight the risk of infection to cruise ship passengers and crew. Like many other viruses, COVID-19 appears to spread more easily between people in close quarters aboard ships.CDC does not recommend that healthy travelers wear facemasks to protect themselves from COVID-19. Wear a facemask only if you are sick and coughing or sneezing to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses to others. If you are well, it is more important to take these important steps to reduce your chances of getting sick:Be aware that some countries are conducting exit screening for all passengers leaving their country. Before being permitted to board a departing flight, you may have your temperature taken and be asked questions about your travel history and health.At this time, travel restrictions and\u00a0entry screening only apply to travelers arriving from countries with a level 3 travel health notice. [Note: US policies are subject to change as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves.]This means that if you traveled from countries other than those listed above, you:If you are arriving to the United States from a country with level 2 travel health notice, you will be asked to monitor your health and practice social distancing. Social distancing means staying out of crowded places, avoiding group gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible.If you are coming from an international destination with a level 3 Travel Health Notice, you will be asked to stay home for 14 days from the time you return from travel, monitor your health and practice social distancing. Social distancing means staying out of crowded places, avoiding group gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible.At this time, American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and family members (as specified in the\u00a0Presidential Proclamationexternal icon) who have been in countries with a Level 3 travel health notice within 14 days prior to their arrival will be allowed to enter the United States.\u00a0Travelers from some countries with a level 3 travel health notice are being re-directed to certain airports and are screened for COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough or trouble breathing and asked questions about their travel and possible exposure to COVID-19.\u00a0Travelers without symptoms will be told to stay home and practice social distancing.More information for travelers from countries with a level 3 travel health notice is available\u00a0here.Currently, any traveler arriving to the United States after leaving a country with Level 3 travel health notice related to COVID-19 in the past 14 days will have some level of restrictions on their movements. All travelers from these countries should stay home and practice social distancing for 14 days from the time they left the outbreak area.Foreign nationals who have visited China, Iran, and most European Countries in the past 14 days are temporarily not allowed to enter the United States.See CDC\u2019s website about what to do if you get sick.To receive email updates about COVID-19, enter your email address:",

            "main_text": "City and federal health officials confirmed Friday that two people evacuated from the cruise ship Diamond Princess and brought to Lackland Air Force Base carried the COVID-19 infection.The Centers for Disease Control, Texas Department of State Health Services and the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District briefed the media on Friday and updated the number of confirmed cases in Bexar County to three. They added that the risk to the public remains low.In an statement, the CDC also said it \"expects additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 from within the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship cohort and will share information with the public as appropriate.\"Metro Health Director Dr. Dawn Emerick explained \"that the federally ordered quarantine is functioning as it should. Those evacuees, who are in quarantine on Lackland Air Force Base, who test positive for COVID-19 remain in isolation from the general public and other evacuees.\u201dThe Texas Department of State Health Services noted in a statement on Friday that it is using the Texas Center for Infectious Disease hospital to treat patients who showed symptoms of COVID-19. The CDC explained that patients with the infection reported symptoms that included fever, cough and shortness of breath.The news came the day after 90 evacuees from China housed at Lackland were medically cleared after a two-week quarantine and were allowed to go home. Health officials reported Thursday that the evacuees had emerged from the likely incubation period for this virus.Dr. Anita Kurian, who directs the Communicable Disease Division of the city's health department, explained that the patients, who were evacuated from China's Hubei Province, \"did not develop any symptoms, and now they're considered no risk.\"A statement from the CDC about the cleared patients stressed that \"[i]t is important to know that these people being released from quarantine pose no health risk to the surrounding community, or to the communities they will be returning to.\"One traveler tested positive for COVID-19 during the quarantine period and was transferred to Methodist Texsan hospital, becoming Bexar County's first case. On Thursday, the hospital announced the individual was treated and transferred to another medical facility \"for ongoing evaluation.\" It did not identify the facility, and it did not identify the patient.The evacuees from the Diamond Princess, which was docked near Tokyo, Japan, were flown from Japan to the U.S. in mid-February.In a statement following their arrival at Lackland, San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg said that \"the risk to the general public of contracting COVID-19 continues to remain low. Every precaution has been taken to keep the public isolated from these travelers who are in a precautionary quarantine and any travelers who have shown symptoms of the virus. Our residents should continue to go about their lives.\u201dAlso on Thursday, the CDC announced it would no longer remove anyone in a coronavirus quarantine from the on-base housing facility to test them for COVID-19.The testing will now occur on the base facilities, and only seriously sick evacuees will go to the hospital. The original plan had been to move them to a hospital for testing if they had symptoms of an upper respiratory infection, including a fever.Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff had a problem with that, as did Emerick, the Metro Health director. On TPR's \"The Source,\" Emerick said Thursday that it made no sense for people with minimal symptoms to go to off-base hospitals for COVID-19 testing and then remain in isolation at the hospital until the results came in.\"We don't want folks sitting in our hospitals for three to four days when we don't even know what the test results are,\" she said. \"That puts an amazing amount of strain and resources on our health care system that is 100 percent avoidable.\"U.S. Sen. John Cornyn and Nirenberg met with federal health officials on Thursday to discuss the details of the new protocols.Emerick also warned that even though current procedures have been successful, that didn't mean the city could do the same again and again with future evacuees.\"I would say that it's working now,\" she said, \"but I don't think the system is strong enough to take on any additional burden at this time.\"Emerick said the quarantine was financially straining the city's public health resources. She said her counterparts in other communities facing similar situations felt a similar burden.\"And we are all in alignment, 100%,\" she said, \"that we should be getting financial compensation for this.\"It was not clear if Lackland was expected to house any more evacuees. Defense Department officials said the base can house up to 250 quarantined people.More information is available at the CDC\u2019s dedicated website.

Driven to Discover.Two studies this week in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene are addressing some of the questions raised by a study that has linked mass distribution of an antibiotic to African preschool children to reduced childhood mortality. But the answers remain elusive.The studies are offshoots of the MORDOR (Macrolides Oraux pour R\u00e9duire les D\u00e9c\u00e8s avec un Oeil sur la R\u00e9sistance) trial, a large randomized clinical trial that found that twice-a-year doses of azithromycin over 2 years to healthy children under the age of 5 was associated with a 14% reduction in childhood mortality in rural communities in Niger, Tanzania, and Malawi when compared with communities in which children received a placebo.The results of the MORDOR trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2018, surprised the researchers, who thought they might see an impact on mortality but did not expect a 14% reduction. But they also raised concerns about whether mass distribution of azithromycin could promote antibiotic resistance and reduce the effectiveness of the drug.The concerns about resistance were again raised when the researchers went back and looked at macrolide resistance in bacteria sampled from the children in Niger. That analysis found that the proportion of macrolide resistance Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was significantly higher in children who received azithromycin than in those who received a placebo.But in one of the new studies\u2014another randomized controlled trial conducted in Tanzania in parallel to the original MORDOR mortality trial\u2014investigators found that, when compared with bacteria sampled from children in communities that had received a placebo, four biannual rounds of azithromycin treatment did not appear to result in excess azithromycin resistance over 24 months of follow-up.The trial, conducted by members of the MORDOR field study team in 30 communities in Tanzania, looked at the proportion of azithromycin-resistant S pneumoniae and Escherichia coli isolates recovered from the nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs of children ages 1 to 59 months in communities that had been randomized to receive four biannual distributions of oral azithromycin or a placebo. The samples were collected from 40 children randomly selected from the communities at the beginning of the trial, at 12 months, and at 24 months.The analysis did not find an excess in the proportion of azithromycin-resistant S pneumoniae and E coli isolates in the children who received azithromycin, nor did it find an increase in resistance over time. The respective proportions of azithromycin-resistant S pneumoniae isolates in the azithromycin versus placebo arms at baseline, 12, and 24 months were 26.5% versus 18.1% (P = 0.26), 26.8% versus 16.5% (P = 0.29), and 13.4% versus 17.0% (P = 0.57). The proportions of azithromycin-resistant isolates of E coli at baseline, 12, and 24 months in the azithromycin versus placebo arms were 14.9% versus 18.9% (P = 0.16), 21.5% versus 16.6% (P = 0.10), and 14.9% versus 14.7% (P = 0.95).\"I don't know how to interpret it,\" said co-author Tom Lietman, MD, a member of the MORDOR study group and ophthalmologist at the University of California at San Francisco. \"My gut feeling is whenever you do a trial, it's actually difficult to show a result, even if it is there.\"Lietman and his colleagues say there could be several reasons why they found no increase in resistance. One is that the treated children represent only a small fraction of the randomized communities, and that the rest of the population in those communities may have had a reservoir of susceptible S pneumoniae and E coli strains. In addition, the mean coverage of communities in the azithromycin arm was 75% to 78%, which means that nearly a quarter of children in the azithromycin-treated communities didn't receive the antibiotic and likely had susceptible strains.\"Maybe the fact that a quarter of the children weren't treated allows this reservoir where the susceptible strains are doing just fine, and then they can repopulate the community pretty quickly,\" Lietman said.Ultimately, the results provide little clarity on the big question raised by the MORDOR study.\"I don't think we have resistance figured out with periodic mass antibiotics,\" he said. \"But I do think we're starting to understand the amount of resistance that will selected for by mass antibiotics.\"Lietman said they've learned a few things so far. While mass distribution of azithromycin does select for antibiotic resistance, he explained, it appears to go away when the mass doses are stopped. In addition, they haven't observed dramatic increases in resistance to other antibiotic classes.\"If we treat with azithromycin and the penicillin resistance goes up, that would be a problem,\" he said.Lietman also noted that the MORDOR trials haven't selected for as much antibiotic resistance as the trachoma prevention programs in Africa, in which azithromycin doses are distributed to entire communities to eliminate ocular strains of Chlamydia that cause the disease.It's also still unclear why giving children under 5 azythromycin is linked to reduced childhood mortality. An analysis earlier this month of MORDOR results from Niger found that mortality from malaria, pneumonia, meningitis, and diarrhea in the azithromycin-treated communities were all down compared with the communities that received placebo, so it's possible the antibiotic doses could be having an impact on all those conditions. But that's not a satisfying answer for those who have concerns about mass distribution of azithromycin, Lietman said.\"If it was targeted to just one of those major killers, I think people might be more comfortable with the program,\" he said. \"We're comfortable targeting individual diseases, but we're not comfortable giving antibiotics out non-specifically.\"Another question raised by the original MORDOR mortality study was whether mass azithromycin distribution should specifically target certain high-risk subgroups. That was highlighted by results showing that children ages 1 to 5 months in communities receiving azithromycin saw the greatest reduction in mortality (24.9% lower than in communities receiving placebo).To see whether a targeted strategy might have an impact on the number of lives saved, Lietman and other researchers from the MORDOR study group went back in the second study and looked at mortality among three groups of children from 594 communities in Niger that received azithromycin or placebo: children aged 1 to 5 months, 1 to 11 months, and 1 to 59 months. Their aim was to estimate the number of deaths averted by azithromycin in those three groups.What they found was that the number of deaths averted was among children ages 1 to 59 months (729) was nearly six times the number averted in the 1-to-5-month groups (126), and more than twice the number of deaths averted among the 1-to-11-month group (297).\"This suggests that a policy of targeted treatment would lead to fewer lives saved compared with mass treatment of all preschool-aged children,\" Lietman and his colleagues write in the study.This is an example of the \"prevention paradox,\" Lietman explained. Targeting a high-risk group to receive azithromycin may result in a higher effect per person\u2014and in this case could hypothetically reduce the selection pressure for resistance\u2014but treating a wider group of children would have a larger overall impact on mortality.\"Every time we try to target, we lose a bunch of kids who are also dying, even if at a lower rate,\" he said.The next step in this research will be a larger trial in Niger, which aims to randomize all children under 5 in the country to receive azithromycin or placebo, one region at a time. That trial begins this summer.See also:May 2, 2018, CIDRAP News story \"African study on pre-emptive antibiotics in kids spurs resistance debate\"Jun 6, 2019, CIDRAP News story \"Follow-up study: Mass azithromycin still tied to fewer child deaths\"Get CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now\u00bbUnrestricted financial support provided byGrant support for ASP provided byBecome an underwriter\u00bbCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

            "main_text": "Public health officials have identified a case of tuberculosis in Antigonish, N.S.The patient is connected to a school in the community, but for privacy reasons, officials are not saying which one.Dr. Lynda Earle, acting medical health officer with the Nova Scotia Health Authority's eastern zone, said the patient is being treated and others who may have been in contact are being monitored.\"The risk to the general population is low from this identified case,\" she said. \"We have followed up with all those who may have previously been exposed and we've ensured that no new people are being exposed.\"Tuberculosis\u00a0is contagious, but not as much as the measles, for example, said Earle.\"It's always understandable that people might be concerned about that when they hear about a case, but the risk to communities and to individuals travelling through the area is low,\" she said.People have to have prolonged contact with a patient before they can contract tuberculosis, Earle said.The disease is relatively uncommon in Nova Scotia, she said, but a few cases are identified every year.Earle said members of the public need not be concerned.\"Tuberculosis is preventable, it's treatable and it is curable,\" she said.\"We now have well-defined antibiotic regimens that we can treat individuals with once they are diagnosed.\"Tuberculosis, also known as TB, is one of a number of diseases that are notifiable, meaning that doctors have to report them to public health when a case is diagnosed.According to the Department of Health and Wellness, someone can be infected with tuberculosis, but not have the disease. If untreated, it can be deadly.Earle said tracing the source of the infection\u00a0is part of the process, but with tuberculosis, it is possible to carry the bacteria for years without being contagious and without showing symptoms.It is not yet known how the Antigonish patient contracted the disease, she said, and sometimes the answer is never found.MORE TOP STORIESReporter/EditorTom Ayers has been a reporter and editor for more than 30 years.

            "main_text": "AdvertisementFOLLOW ONAvis Favaro\nMedical Correspondent, CTV National News@ctv_avisfavaro\nContactElizabeth St. Philip\nCTV News@LizTV\nContactGraham Slaughter\nCTVNews.ca Writer@grahamslaughter\nContactSHARETORONTO -- \n\tJeanine Monteiro was back home from her vacation to Cuba for a week when she began to get intense headaches behind her eyes, followed shortly thereafter by strange hallucinations.The unusual symptoms were the first signs of dengue fever, a potentially deadly disease that has exploded in prevalence in South America and the Caribbean with several tropical countries reporting outbreaks and national health emergencies.But at the time, Monteiro, 42, thought she might just have the flu.Within weeks, her symptoms spiralled out of control. She suffered joint pain and stiffness, and slowly lost her grip on reality. At one point, while in the car with her father after a doctor\u2019s appointment, she struggled to read the pain medication she\u2019d just been prescribed.\u201cMy dad kept saying things to me and I remember saying, \u2018Are you speaking English?\u2019 And then I said, \u2018What is this in my hand?\u2019 And he said, \u2018It\u2019s your medication Jeanine. Don\u2019t you remember?\u2019\u201d Monteiro told CTV News from her home in Cambridge, Ont.\u201cThat\u2019s the last memory I have.\u201dIn the car, Monteiro suffered a seizure and was rushed to the emergency department. Doctors made a shocking discovery: she had suffered multiple organ failures and only had a quarter of her heart function left. She spent 11 days on life support as the medical team tried to figure out the source of her life-threatening condition.\u201cThere was a couple days they weren\u2019t sure I was going to make it,\u201d Monteiro said.The answer, it turned out, was a dengue-infected mosquito bite during her recent trip to Cuba. Montero was one of more than 560,000 people in North and South America to contract dengue fever in 2018. Those numbers skyrocketed in 2019 to 3.1 million cases \u2013 more than five times the previous year\u2019s caseload.The problem is widespread. Argentina is currently reporting a dengue fever outbreak, and emergencies have been declared in Honduras, Brazil, Jamaica and Paraguay. Recently, Paraguay\u2019s president, Mario Abdo Benitez, contracted the virus and was ordered to rest.But travellers such as Monteiro said they had no idea just how prevalent \u2013 and how dangerous \u2013 dengue fever could be until they contracted the illness themselves.\u201cThat was my 18th time to Cuba, and I felt very safe going there,\u201d Monteiro said.Even after she recovered, dengue fever has had a lasting effect on Monteiro\u2019s health. The illness triggered an autoimmune disease, scleroderma, that was lying dormant in her system. She also lives with kidney disease and is unable to work.\u201cIt\u2019s devastated my life,\u201d she said. \u201cBesides losing my career that I worked very hard to have, I was pretty healthy before all of this.\u201dLast month, Jodie Dicks, a 26-year-old woman from Toronto, contracted dengue fever while attending her friend\u2019s destination wedding in Jamaica. Less than a week later, she suffered multiple heart attacks and died in her mother\u2019s arms in a Florida medical centre.Dicks\u2019 death has drawn new attention to the disease, for which there is no vaccine available in Canada. CTV News spoke to three survivors who all said that Canadian travellers are not being given enough information about the virus.When Monteiro learned of the young woman\u2019s death, she said she immediately wanted to reach out to Dicks\u2019 parents and offer her condolences.\u201cI think they\u2019re feeling the same as me. They\u2019re angry that there was no information about this. There was no preparation or warning,\u201d she said.\u201cPeople need to know that this is happening. You might not hear about it often, it might be rare, but it\u2019s happening, and it\u2019s happening in all the most popular vacation spots.\u201dWHAT IS DENGUE FEVER?Dengue fever is primarily spread by mosquitos. Symptoms include a sudden high fever, rash, nausea, swollen glands and pain in the bones, joints and eyes.The federal government says travellers are at risk when travelling to countries where dengue fever is present. According to the World Health Organization, more than 40 per cent of the world\u2019s population lives in areas where dengue can be transmitted.Travel agents in Canada are encouraged, though not required, to warn travellers of such risks, according to the Association of Canadian Travel Agencies.But what many people may not know about dengue fever is that the illness is potentially much more dangerous if a person contracts the virus more than once. That means frequent fliers to dengue-affected countries could be at greater risk.\u201cIf you are infected once, you're actually at a set-up for a really bad outcome the second time when you are hit with a different strain,\u201d said infectious diseases specialist Dr. Neil Rau.Monteiro said that, due to the severity of her illness, there is a \u201cbig possibility\u201d that she contracted dengue fever before. On an earlier trip to Jamaica she contracted flu-like symptoms on the third day of the trip and suffered lasting symptoms for weeks. After being prescribed antibiotics, she got better.\u201cIt never occurred to me until I started reading and researching this disease and found out that it\u2019s very possible that I was bitten once before,\u201d she said. \u201cA lightbulb kind of went off.\u201dIt\u2019s a situation Arletta Doroszuk is familiar with. The 50-year-old from Courtice, Ont. travelled to the Bahamas in 2011 and, after a few days of arriving home, suffered from a high fever and severe pain in her hands.Doroszuk visited her doctor several times and, after the condition worsened, she was eventually tested for dengue fever. The tests came back positive.Nine years after that trip, she hasn\u2019t travelled south again. She\u2019s afraid of what might happen if she contracts dengue a second time.\u201cI\u2019m just afraid I might get (the virus again) and I will not be so lucky,\u201d she said.Her advice for travellers: pack bug repellent and research your travel destination to see if dengue fever is present.Another woman, Carla Radke from Winnipeg, travelled to the Mexican community of Guayabitos north of Puerto Vallarta for a three-month vacation with her husband. She said her hotel sprayed for mosquitoes, but she still ended up suffering from pain behind her eyes and aching muscles -- both symptoms of the illness.She was sick for nine days and, over the coming months, lost nearly 100 lbs. She was shocked when she found out she had dengue fever.\u201cI never thought of dengue. I only thought of Zika. To me, dengue is like an old thing...Zika was newer, and that was on my mind,\u201d she said.UNDERSTANDING THE RISKJodie Dicks\u2019 mother, Christine Boissoin, and stepfather, Randy Boissoin, said they want to make sure that their daughter did not die \u201cin vain.\u201d They are now speaking out in hopes of educating other Canadians about the risks of dengue fever.They say the government\u2019s warnings are not easy to find, and that not enough travellers are aware of the problem.\u201cJodie is not here with us now -- this isn\u2019t a one-off. My Lord, people need the information,\u201d Ryan Boissoin said.\u201cI would say just look at our story. We have a daughter who didn\u2019t come home, and if you don\u2019t think it isn\u2019t a potential reality, you are sadly mistaken.\u201dJeanine Monteiro, 42, contracted dengue fever during a trip to Cuba. She says Canadians aren't being given sufficient warning about the potentially deadly illness.The city is hoping to begin using another product next year, Delta Guard, to battle mosquitoes.

            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.The United Kingdom's Food Standards Agency (FSA) released two surveillance reports this week on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in chicken meat.The two surveys looked at antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli and Campylobacter in fresh chicken sold at UK retail stores in 2017 and 2018. Of the 309 samples tested for resistant E coli, no samples were positive for carbapenem resistance or plasmid-mediated colistin resistance, while 23 (8.4%) expressed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-phenotype resistance, 16 (5.2%) expressed AmpC-phenotype resistance, and 3 expressed both ESBL- and AmpC-phenotype resistance.Overall, the proportion of chicken meat samples positive for ESBL-producing E coli fell from 65.4% in 2013-2014 to 8.4% in 2018, and AmpC-producing E coli fell from 16.3% in 2016 to 5.2% in 2018. The FSA said this decrease could be linked to the banning of cephalosporins in poultry meat flocks by the UK Poultry Council in 2012.Of the 392 samples tested for resistant Campylobacter bacteria, ciprofloxacin resistance was detected in 52% of Campylobacter jejuni isolates (171/328), and 48% of Campylobacter coli isolates (31/65). Multidrug resistance was found in 5 of 328 C jejuni isolates (2%) and 6 of 65 C coli isolates (9%). Overall, the proportions of antibiotic-resistant and multidrug-resistant Campylobacter isolates identified were similar to those found in previous survey years.\"While there is evidence that AMR bacteria are present on chicken sold in the UK, it is encouraging to see the levels holding steady and even reducing,\" Paul Cook, FSA science lead in microbiological risk assessment, said in an agency press release. \"The risk of getting AMR-related infections through eating or preparing contaminated meat remains very low as long as you follow good hygiene and cooking practices.\"Feb 18 FSA press release Feb 18 FSA E coli survey Feb 18 FSA Campylobacter surveyA study of patients in four European hospitals has found that contact isolation showed no benefit when added to standard precautions for controlling the spread of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) on non-critical care wards with extensive surveillance screening, researchers reported yesterday in the Lancet Infectious Diseases.In the cluster-randomized trial conducted at university hospitals in Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland, patients in medical, surgical, and combined medical-surgical wards were randomized to continue standard precautions alone or implement contact isolation alongside standard precautions for 12 months, followed by a 1-month washout period and 12 months of an alternative strategy. Patients were screened for ESBL-E on carriage within 3 days of admission, once a week thereafter, and on discharge. The primary outcome was the incidence density of ESBL-E.Between Jan 6, 2014, and Aug 31, 2016, 38,357 patients were admitted to the hospital wards. Among 15,184 patients with a length of stay of more than 1 week, 11,368 patients (75%) were screened at least twice. The incidence density of ward-acquired ESBL-E was 6.0 events per 1,000 patient-days at risk (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.4 to 6.7) during periods of contact isolation and 6.1 (95% CI, 5.5 to 6.7) during periods of standard precautions (P = 0\u00b79710). Multivariable analysis adjusted for length of stay, percentage of patients screened, and prevalence in first screening cultures yielded an incidence rate ratio of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.80 to 1.22; P = 0.9177) for care under contact isolation compared with standard precautions.\"The results of this trial suggest that current real-life practice in many countries, including the targeted identification of carriers and expanded use of contact isolation, is ineffective in preventing the spread of ESBL-E in endemic settings,\" the authors conclude.The findings are significant because while many guidelines recommend the use of contact isolation for patients colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria, several studies in recent years have questioned their effectiveness. In addition, research has shown that patients under contact isolation express greater dissatisfaction with their treatment.Feb 19 Lancet Infect Dis abstractSpanish investigators yesterday in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy reported good results from using two commercial rapid diagnostic tests\u2014Xpert Carba-R and Eazyplex SuperBug CRE\u2014to detect bacterial carbapenem resistance genes directly in lower respiratory tract samples.The researcher team used the two tests\u2014the former a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and the other employing loop-mediated isothermal amplification\u2014for detecting carbapenemase carriage in Enterobacteriaceae directly from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The researchers added well-characterized carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains to the BAL samples to observe how the tests would perform.Xpert Carba-R demonstrated 100% agreement with carbapenemase characterization by PCR and sequencing for all final bacteria concentrations. Eazyplex SuperBug CRE showed 100%, 80% and 27% agreement with PCR and sequencing at diminishing pathogen concentrations. False-negative results for Eazyplex SuperBug CRE matched the highest cycle threshold values for Xpert Carba-R. Hands-on time for both assays was about 15\u2009min, but Eazyplex SuperBug CRE results were available within 30\u2009min, whereas Xpert Carba-R took around 50\u2009min.The authors say their results could be used as proof-of-concept data for validating the tests for this purpose.Feb 19 J Antimicrob Chemother abstractIn the first 5 weeks of 2020, Nigeria has confirmed 472 Lassa fever cases, including 70 deaths, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in an update today. The outbreak has grown by 309 confirmed cases and 46 deaths since a WHO update on Jan 28.The cases were reported from Jan 1 through Feb 9, and 26 of 36 states are affected. Edo (167 cases) and Ondo (156) are by far the hardest-hit states.Fifteen healthcare workers have contracted the disease, one of whom died. Another health worker who had a probable case also died. Officials confirmed 793 Lassa fever cases in Nigeria in all of 2019, but this year cases are outpacing those seen during the same period last year.Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria, typically with an annual peak in the dry season (December through April) following the reproduction cycle of Mastomys rats (common African rats) in the wet season (May through June).The WHO said, \"Given that 90-95% of human infections are due to indirect exposure to (through food or household items contaminated by infected rats' urine and faeces) or direct contact with infected Mastomys rats, the very high density and high circulation of Lassa fever virus in young non-immune rat population during the wet season create a potential for further human infection, thus, the number of infections is expected to continue to rise until the end of the dry season.\"Feb 20 WHO updateJan 28 CIDRAP News scan on earlier reportGet CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now\u00bbUnrestricted financial support provided byGrant support for ASP provided byBecome an underwriter\u00bbCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

            "headline": "At midseason, flu vaccine yields 45% protection in US, 58% in Canada",
            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.The current seasonal flu vaccine protects about 45% of recipients against the circulating strains, according to midseason estimates of vaccine effectiveness (VE) published today in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.A higher percentage, 58%, was seen in the first estimates on effectiveness during Canada's flu season, which were published in a separate study today.The CDC said the US flu season started early\u2014the earliest seasons since the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic year\u2014in the first week of November, and is still currently above baseline activities.To conduct the study, CDC researchers and their state partners used data collected from five study sites (Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin), on patients aged 6 months or older seeking outpatient medical care for an acute respiratory illness (ARI) with cough within 7 days of illness onset. Any patient who took antiviral medications was not included in the study.Among the 4,112 ARI patients enrolled in the study from Oct 23, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020, a total of 1,060 (26%) tested positive for influenza virus infection, including 691 (17% of the total patients) for influenza B viruses and 374 (9%) for influenza A viruses. A total of 37% of flu-positive patients had received the 2019-20 seasonal influenza vaccine, compared with 55% who were unvaccinated.Overall, the adjusted VE was 45% against influenza A and B viruses combined, 50% against influenza B/Victoria, and 37% against A/H1N1, the authors said. Flu VE for adults ages 18 to 49 against H1N1 was especially low (5%; 95% confidence interval, \u2212 45% to 37%), and younger adults and children seemed to get more protection from the vaccine against all circulating flu strains.\"Interim VE estimates against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses among children and older adults are consistent with average VE for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses reported previously,\" the authors wrote.\"Among adults aged 18\u201349 years, the interim VE estimate against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was low and not statistically significant. Additional enrollment during the season while A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulate will determine whether VE against A(H1N1)pdm09 in this age group is lower than during previous seasons and will help evaluate potential contributing factors to lower than expected effectiveness.\"The beginning of the US flu season was dominated by influenza B/Victoria, but since December, cases of H1N1 flu have increased.Despite the protection, the authors said markers of severe illness, including laboratory-confirmed flu-associated hospitalization rates among children and adolescents, are higher than in recent seasons, including the severe 2017-18 season.The authors also noted that the 92 flu-associated deaths in children are the most at this point in the season since reporting began in 2004-05, other than the 2009 pandemic season, and stress the importance of still getting vaccinated if people have not yet done so.The Canadian flu season was also defined by early influenza B/Victoria activity, but the flu vaccine has proved more effective so far, according to a Eurosurveillance study. Patients 1 year old and older presenting at study sites in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec were included in the study.Of the 2,808 specimens tested, 1,411 (50%) were influenza test-positive, including 731 (52%) influenza A and 683 (48%) influenza B viruses, with three influenza A and B co-infections. Of the influenza A cases, (77%) were H1N1 and 23% were H3N2. Among the influenza B detections, 99% were B/Victoria.Overall, VE against any strain was 58%, including 74% in children ages 1 to 19 years, and 18% in adults 65 and older. VE was 44% against H1N1, 62% against H3N2, and 69% against influenza B. As in the United States, the vaccine provided better protection in children and adults under 50 seemed to get more protection from the vaccine.\"The mid-season VE of 44% we report for A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses during the 2019/20 season is lower than we reported mid-season in 2018/19 (72%) [8], 2015/16 (64%) [12] or 2013/14 (74%),\" the authors wrote.They conclude, \"Interim results from Canada's SPSN indicate that the 2019/20 influenza vaccine has provided substantial protection against medically-attended influenza illness during a season characterised by an approximately equal mix of influenza A and B viruses, a substantial proportion of which were genetically and antigenically mismatched to vaccine.\"They also suggest the substantial VE despite a mismatch between the circulating strains and the vaccine strains, \"invites exploration of other factors potentially contributing to VE.\"Get CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now\u00bbUnrestricted financial support provided byGrant support for ASP provided byBecome an underwriter\u00bbCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.Iran today reported three more COVID-19 cases today, as the number of new infections jumped in South Korea and in Japan, amid several new Diamond Princess developments, including the first two deaths and a US government agency clash over the evacuation of infected passengers.Meanwhile, China reported 394 new cases of the new coronavirus illness, a sharp drop that follows a case definition change that includes only lab-tested positives among the confirmed cases.Following a report yesterday of its first two cases, both fatal, Iran's health ministry today reported three more. Two are in Qom, the same city where the first two cases were confirmed, and one is in Arak, located about 92 miles southwest of that city.All three patients are Iranian citizens, and the ministry's machine-translated statement said the patient in Arak is a doctor. It said health officials have proposed limiting visits to Qom's holy shrine and other pilgrimage sites. Among other measures, the health ministry has also advised canceling seminars and conferences in Qom.A health official was quoted in Iran's state news agency as saying the patients whose illnesses and deaths were announced yesterday had not had any contact with foreigners or people who had traveled to \u00a0China, Al Jazeera reported today. It added that an advisor to Iran's health ministry said testing is under way on suspected cases in several other cities, and that the state news agency reported that two people with suspected infections have been quarantined in Babol, located in northern Iran.Since yesterday, South Korea has reported 53 more cases, raising its total to 104, and the country also reported its first death from the virus, according to the latest reports from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. South Korea now has the most cases outside China, excluding the Diamond Princess cluster.Of the 22 most recent cases, 21 were in Daegu and Gyeongbuk, and 1 was in Seoul. Five appear to be part of a church cluster, 1 is from New Oriental Hospital in Seoul, and 13, including the death, are linked to Qingdao Daenam Hospital.A BBC report said 30 of the 53 new cases are linked to the church, described as a sect, in Daegu, South Korea's fourth-largest city, with a population of about 2.5 million. It also noted that the COVID-19 death occurred in a 63-year-old man who was hospitalized in Cheongdo, where 15 people at the facility had tested positive for the virus.Daegu is also home to a US Army garrison, which has restricted access and closed schools and nonessential businesses for a second day, Stars and Stripes reported today. It said US service members will be allowed to wear face masks while in uniform. So far, no cases have been detected in US personnel.At a World Health Organization (WHO) media telebriefing today, Oliver Morgan, PhD, who directs the WHO's health emergency information and risk assessment department, said the rising numbers in South Korea mainly involve several clusters linked to known cases.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, the WHO's director-general, said that, with the measures South Korea is taking, the disease spread is manageable.Japan's health ministry today reported two deaths in passengers who had been on the Diamond Princess, both of whom were in their 80s and were hospitalized on shore. Both were Japanese, one a man with underlying health conditions from Kanagawa and the other a woman from Tokyo.In another development related to the ship, the health ministry said today that two government officials have been infected following their work on the ship, one from the health ministry and another from the cabinet secretary.In other cruise ship developments, the Washington Post, citing unnamed people involved in the discussions, reported today that US government officials on Feb 16 wrestled with whether to allow 14 infected Americans to fly home on a chartered jet with a group of 300 American evacuees. It said officials received word that test results were positive for 14 people shortly before the plane was to leave Japan.Officials from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) opposed mixing the infected and uninfected people, because of the increased transmission risk, and the State Department had announced earlier that infected people would not be allowed to board the planes.But the State Department and a Trump Administration official ended up overruling the CDC's advice. The infected travelers didn't have symptoms, and the plane had a plastic-lined enclosure to separate the passengers. According to the report, the CDC insisted that the agency not be mentioned in the news release lest people think that the infected people flew with the others based on CDC advice.Japan's health ministry also reported 10 more cases in seven different locations, raising its overall total\u2014not including the cruise ship\u2014to 84, according to a summary from the country's health ministry. The locations include Sagamihara, Kanagawa Prefecture, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Okinawa prefecture, Tokyo, and Nagoya.The US CDC yesterday issued a travel watch for Japan owing to multiple instances of community spread reported in the country. A travel watch, the CDC's lowest travel advisory level, urges visitors to practice usual precautions, such as avoiding sick people and washing hands frequently.China's National Health Commission today reported 394 new cases, down sharply from the 1,739 reported yesterday, which follows the country's announcement yesterday that it will no longer include clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases with the lab-confirmed numbers. The overall total is now 74,576.The country also reported 114 more deaths and 113 fewer serious illnesses, putting those respective totals at 2,118 and 11,864.In other developments inside China, government officials in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, announced that work suspension has been extended to Mar 11, Reuters reported. Schools will also remain shuttered, and the only firms allowed to resume work are those involved in outbreak control and public services.Singapore's health ministry today reported 1 more case, raising the country's total to 85. It said contact tracing is under way to identify any links to earlier cases or travel to China. The country has linked all but 9 cases to clusters or earlier cases.In its daily situation report today, the WHO said that over the past 24 hours it has received reports of 149 new cases outside of China, raising the total to 1,073, 8 of them fatal, from 26 countries.

            "main_text": "A sixth person in B.C. is believed to be infected with the coronavirus, and the case is raising new questions about how the disease is spreading, health officials announced Thursday.The latest patient is a woman in her 30s who lives in the Fraser Health region, according to provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry. She had recently returned from a trip\u00a0to Iran and is now recovering at home.Henry said officials were surprised when they learned the woman had only visited Iran, and not China or neighbouring countries that have seen the bulk of COVID-19 cases.\"That could be an indicator that there's more widespread transmission. This is what we call an indicator or sentinel event,\" Henry told a news conference.\"I expect there'll be an international investigation to try to understand where the exposure occurred.\"She added that Iran has recently announced five cases of the virus and two deaths.Henry described the woman's infection as relatively mild, and said she tested positive for the virus after visiting the hospital with what she thought were symptoms of the flu.The patient has had contact with others since her return from Iran last week. Close family members are currently in isolation and being monitored by public health officials.She said health officials are looking into when the patient's symptoms started to help determine if they need to notify those who travelled with her on the same aircraft. Her diagnosis is considered presumptive until confirmed by the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg.Henry said the diagnosis shows B.C. has a robust system for identifying people who have the virus. All cases so far have been relatively mild, according to health officials.The update comes one day after Henry revealed that B.C.'s first confirmed coronavirus\u00a0patient has fully recovered, and that four others are symptom free.The fifth, a woman in her 30s who returned from Shanghai, China, is in isolation at her home in B.C.'s Interior.Henry said over 500 people have been tested for the virus in B.C. and many of those tested positive for the flu. Three cases of the virus have also been confirmed in Ontario.Health Minister Adrian Dix said the province is currently testing a \"very significant number\" of patients for the virus, and he expects to provide another update on Friday.China, where an outbreak has caused more than 2,200 deaths, has reported another drop in new virus cases to 889 as COVID-19 spreads elsewhere.China's latest figures released Friday for the previous 24 hours brought the total number of cases to 75,465. The 118 newly reported deaths raised the total to 2,236.More than 1,000 cases and 11 deaths have been confirmed outside the mainland.Iran announced three more infections Thursday, a day after it reported its first two deaths, and South Korea reported its first fatality. Japan said two former passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship had died of the illness.With files from The Canadian PressTo encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

She had recently returned from a trip\u00a0to Iran and is now recovering at home.Henry said officials were surprised when they learned the woman had only visited Iran, and not China or neighbouring countries that have seen the bulk of COVID-19 cases.\"That could be an indicator that there's more widespread transmission. This is what we call an indicator or sentinel event,\" Henry told a news conference.\"I expect there'll be an international investigation to try to understand where the exposure occurred.\"She added that Iran has recently announced five cases of the virus and two deaths.Henry described the woman's infection as relatively mild, and said she tested positive for the virus after visiting the hospital with what she thought were symptoms of the flu.The patient has had contact with others since her return from Iran last week. Close family members are currently in isolation and being monitored by public health officials.She said health officials are looking into when the patient's symptoms started to help determine if they need to notify those who travelled with her on the same aircraft. Her diagnosis is considered presumptive until confirmed by the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg.Henry said the diagnosis shows B.C. has a robust system for identifying people who have the virus. All cases so far have been relatively mild, according to health officials.The update comes one day after Henry revealed that B.C.'s first confirmed coronavirus\u00a0patient has fully recovered, and that four others are symptom free.The fifth, a woman in her 30s who returned from Shanghai, China, is in isolation at her home in B.C.'s Interior.Henry said over 500 people have been tested for the virus in B.C. and many of those tested positive for the flu. Three cases of the virus have also been confirmed in Ontario.Health Minister Adrian Dix said the province is currently testing a \"very significant number\" of patients for the virus, and he expects to provide another update on Friday.China, where an outbreak has caused more than 2,200 deaths, has reported another drop in new virus cases to 889 as COVID-19 spreads elsewhere.China's latest figures released Friday for the previous 24 hours brought the total number of cases to 75,465. The 118 newly reported deaths raised the total to 2,236.More than 1,000 cases and 11 deaths have been confirmed outside the mainland.Iran announced three more infections Thursday, a day after it reported its first two deaths, and South Korea reported its first fatality. Japan said two former passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship had died of the illness.With files from The Canadian PressTo encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

All rights reserved.\n      All market data delayed 20 minutes.Fox News medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel says the Trump administration has given the American public confidence in approaching coronavirus.At least 11 American evacuees transported to the U.S. from the quarantined\u00a0Diamond Princess cruise ship\u00a0have tested positive for\u00a0the coronavirus, as another doctor in China was pronounced dead from the virus Friday.The American evacuees were transported to U.S. hospitals after delayed Japenese test results showed they tested positive. Five other people were confirmed to have shown symptoms of the virus.None of the 16 evacuees has had confirmed tests by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, so federal authorities have yet to report them.\u00a0They have been staying at Travis Air Force Base in California.Four were taken to a hospital in Washington state, while Scott Pauley, a CDC spokesman, wouldn't elaborate on where the others were taken.TENNESSEE DOCTOR, WIFE SEE CORONAVIRUS TURN THEIR CRUISE VACATION INTO A NIGHTMARE AS WIFE TESTS POSITIVEThe newly infected reportedly\u00a0don't include the\u00a014 people who officials had previously said tested positive before boarding two\u00a0State Department chartered flights carrying 300 Americans from the Diamond Princess last Monday.\u00a0Thirteen of them were brought to a hospital in Omaha, Neb., and the CDC says 11 are officially declared to have the virus.Another doctor in Wuhan was also confirmed to have been killed by the virus\u00a0Friday, adding to the list of leading medical professionals now deceased in the virus's epicenter.Peng Yinhua, a 29-year-old respiratory doctor died Thursday.\u00a0Others killed by the virus include Wuchang Hospital director Liu Zhiming and Li Wenliang, who warned authorities about the virus before it was public.China has suffered the most from the virus, which is now known as COVID-19, with the country having 99 percent of the cases. The U.S. has 26 patients, including 11\u00a0confirmed so far at a Nebraska hospital, eight in California, one in Texas, one in Wisconsin, one in Arizona, one in Washington state, one in Massachusetts and two in Illinois. Those numbers don't include the 11 recently shown to have the new virus.CDC officials added there will \u201clikely be additional cases in the coming days and weeks, including among other people recently returned from Wuhan.\u201dUT AUSTIN ANNOUNCES CORONAVIRUS 'BREAKTHROUGH' COULD HELP YIELD VACCINEThe U.S. had announced that Americans who traveled to\u00a0China within the last 14 days would be sent to designated airports for enhanced screenings. Foreign nationals who recently went to\u00a0China would be denied entry in the U.S., except for the immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents.China's\u00a0Foreign Ministry had said the U.S. hasn't given the country any substantive\u00a0help in its fight against\u00a0the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0outbreak. They added the U.S. was contributing to the international panic surrounding the illness, Reuters reported.People wearing face masks walk through a public park in Beijing, Friday, Feb. 21, 2020. (Associated Press)ISRAEL: PEOPLE WHO VIOLATE COROANVIRUS SELF-QUARANTINES COULD FACE YEARS IN PRISONThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global emergency as it spreads to countries outside of China and the number of infected patients continues to grow.Countries around the globe have increased travel restrictions\u00a0to the infected mainland China and Hubei province \u2014\u00a0with the U.S. State Department increasing its advisory to level 4: \"Do Not Travel.\"The CDC has issued an advisory to avoid all nonessential travel to the country.Coronavirus has now killed about three times the amount of\u00a0people in China than were sickened during the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s. The SARS outbreak killed\u00a0349 people\u00a0in mainland China in 2002-2003 -- with 744 deaths and 8,096 infections globally, according to the\u00a0CDC.Here are the latest figures.How many have been infected or have\u00a0died?The virus has claimed the lives of 2,236\u00a0people and infected 75,465 around the globe. Only 11 people have died outside mainland China.South Korea recorded its first fatality from the virus on Thursday.France announced its first death on Saturday in a Chinese tourist who died in the country. It was the first fatality outside of Asia.Japan announced two people\u00a0in their 80s who were on the Diamond Princess cruise ship had died on Thursday. A week earlier, an\u00a080-year-old woman died after being hospitalized near Toyko since Feb. 1.The other deaths were in\u00a0Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Philippines.The WHO said the number of cases will keep growing as tests are pending on thousands of suspected cases.Where is the virus?Roughly 99 percent of new cases have appeared in China with the vast majority of the cases in Hubei province and its provincial capital, Wuhan -- the epicenter of the virus.The United Kingdom has nine cases in the country.SOUTH KOREA REPORTS FIRST CORONAVIRUS DEATH: HEALTH OFFICIALSJapan\u00a0-- 519 (607 passengers on Diamond Princess cruise ship outside Yokohama) (3 deaths)South Korea -- 104 (1 death)Singapore\u00a0-- 84Thailand\u00a0-- 35South Korea\u00a0-- 31Taiwan\u00a0-- 24\u00a0(1 death)Malaysia\u00a0-- 22Germany\u00a0-- 16Vietnam\u00a0-- 16Australia\u00a0-- 15France\u00a0-- 12 (1 death)United Arab Emirates\u00a0-- 9Canada\u00a0-- 8India\u00a0-- 3Italy\u00a0-- 3Philippines\u00a0-- 3 (1 death)Russia\u00a0-- 2Spain\u00a0-- 2Iran -- 2Sweden\u00a0-- 1Belgium\u00a0-- 1Nepal\u00a0-- 1Finland\u00a0--1Sri Lanka\u00a0-- 1Cambodia\u00a0-- 1Egypt -- 1Hong Kong -- 67 (1 death)Macao -- 10Differences between coronavirus and the flu?The flu has estimated to have killed roughly 10,000 to 25,000 people with nearly 19 to 26 million infected in the U.S. between October 1, 2019, and January 25, 2020, according to the\u00a0CDC. Coronavirus has impacted a far lesser number, although it's not yet clear how many have been infected or how widespread it is.There have also been reports it can be spread without symptoms showing up. In respiratory illnesses,\u00a0people with the most symptoms are the most contagious, the agency said. Children and those over 65 are the most likely to get sick from the flu, the CDC added.IS THE NOVEL CORONAVUS HERE TO STAY?People wearing face masks walk on a down own street in Hong Kong Friday, Feb. 21, 2020. COVID-19 viral illness has sickened tens of thousands of people in China since December. (Associated Press)Unlike the coronavirus, there's a seasonal vaccine for the flu. People over six months out are\u00a0advised\u00a0by the agency to get it during annual vaccination, with certain rare exceptions, such as severe allergies to the shot.No vaccine\u00a0has been developed for coronavirus as of yet, which makes it dangerous in that respect.How did it start?It's not entirely clear how it started, but Chinese scientists believe the virus may have originated in bats. The pangolin, a type of scaly anteater was reported to be a possible host, according to a Chinese University. A study by the Wuhan Institute of Virology said that genome sequences from seven patients tested were identical to the bat coronavirus.How does it transmit?It's believed the normal coronavirus\u00a0can be transmitted\u00a0most commonly through respiratory droplets in the\u00a0air, as well as close contact with an infected person or touching areas contaminated with the virus before washing. The digestive tract may also transmit the disease, according to scientists from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Science.HOW IS CORONAVIRUS TRANSMITTED?They recently discovered \"virus genetic material\" in feces samples and rectal swabs from some patients, Chinese state media reported.What are the current travel restrictions?The U.S.\u00a0declared\u00a0the coronavirus a public health emergency with Trump signing an order barring entry to foreign nationals who recently were in China, other than the immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents.Officials at the CDC have\u00a0advised travelers to avoid all\u00a0nonessential travel\u00a0to the country. The U.S. State Department raised its China travel advisory to \"Level 4: Do Not Travel.\"\"Those currently in China should consider departing using commercial means. The Department of State has requested that all non-essential U.S. government personnel defer travel to China in light of the novel coronavirus,\"\u00a0The\u00a0advisory\u00a0said.Vietnam stopped\u00a0all flights to and from China.Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia all have similar policies to the U.S. on restricting non-citizens.Mongolia and Singapore have shut their\u00a0borders.Singapore said it would ban travelers from China's Hubei province.Pakistan says they're halting all flights to and from ChinaPeople wear face masks as they ride along a road in Beijing, Friday, Feb. 21, 2020.

Driven to Discover.York University this week announced a $2 million grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to support the development of a global network to address infectious disease and antimicrobial resistance.The One Health Network for the Global Governance of Infectious Diseases and Antimicrobial Resistance (GRIDD) will be co-led by York University and the University of Ottawa and will include a transdisciplinary team of researchers from the social sciences and the human, animal, and environmental health sciences. The network will be closely integrated with related European efforts.\"As the causes of antimicrobial resistance are complex, our strategies to address it need to foster intersectoral policy coordination on a global scale to improve stewardship of this precious resource,\" Mary Wiktorowiz, PhD, a professor of global health policy and governance at York University, said in a university press release.Feb 18 York University press releaseScientists from Purdue University will receive $3.2 million from the National Institutes of Health to develop a new treatment for antibiotic-resistant lower respiratory infections.The money will enable the scientists to continue development of new inhalation therapies that incorporate synergistic antibiotics into a nano-sized liposome. Using liposomes for inhalation therapy minimizes local irritation in the airways, which can compromise patients' compliance, and allows for controlled release of the drugs.\"Our research not only develops new inhalation therapies, but also examines the mechanism of drug-induced pulmonary side effects and tries to find out how liposomes protect the airways from such side effects,\" lead researcher Qi Zhou, PhD, an assistant professor in Purdue's College of Pharmacy, said in a university press release. \"In addition, such platform may also be applied for the treatment of other lung infections including tuberculosis and viral lung infections by loading different drugs.\"Researchers from the University of Michigan, University of North Carolina, and Monash University in Australia are also involved in the project.Feb 20 Purdue University press releaseGet CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now\u00bbUnrestricted financial support provided byGrant support for ASP provided byBecome an underwriter\u00bbCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

Driven to Discover.After a month-long rise, US flu levels dropped last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today in its weekly FluView report. But most regions are still experiencing elevated influenza activity, and 13 more pediatric deaths were recorded, raising the 2019-20 flu season total to 105.Some flu markers, including rates of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) dropped last week, to 6.1%, compared with the previous week's 6.7%. The percentage of specimens positively identified as influenza also dropped slightly, from 30.8% to 29.6%.The number of jurisdictions reporting high ILI activity remained the same as noted last week, 46. The number of jurisdictions reporting regional or widespread flu dropped from 51 to 48.\"Key indicators that track flu activity remain high but decreased slightly this week. Indicators that track overall severity (hospitalizations and deaths) are not high at this point in the season,\" the CDC said. The cumulative hospitalization rate was 47.4 per 100,000 population, similar to what has been seen in other flu seasons, even though it was up from 41.9 per 100,000 the week before.As has been the trend in recent weeks, detections of influenza A outpaced influenza B, with public health labs confirming that 64.9% of positive specimens were influenza A and 35.1% were influenza B. Of the subtyped influenza A specimens, 96.0% were 2009 H1N1, and 4.0% were H3N2. Influenza B/Victoria accounted for 98.4% of B viruses detected.Yesterday the CDC released interim estimates of 2019-20 flu vaccine effectiveness, which showed protection was 45% overall and 55% in children.

            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.A study conducted by researchers in the United Kingdom has found that use of macrolide antibiotics during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of birth defects in children.The study, published this week in the BMJ, looked at data on more than 100,000 children born in the United Kingdom from 1990 to 2016 to mothers who were prescribed macrolides or penicillins at any time during their pregnancy. The results showed that the association between risk of any birth defect, specifically heart defects, and macrolide use during the first trimester was significantly higher than it was for penicillin use.Although the findings are observational and do not establish that macrolide antibiotics cause birth defects, they add to growing concerns about use of the drugs during pregnancy. Macrolides are widely used to treat infections in pregnant women with suspected penicillin allergies, but research has shown associations between macrolides and increased risk of heart arrhythmia and cardiovascular mortality, as well as miscarriage in pregnant women.The authors of the study say the link indicates that alternative antibiotics should be considered for pregnant women.\"Our findings suggest it would be better to avoid macrolides during pregnancy if alternative antibiotics can be used,\" study co-author Ruth Gilbert, MD, PhD, a professor of clinical epidemiology at University College London's (UCL's) Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, said in a university press release.For the study, UCL researchers used data from the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink to analyze 104,605 children whose mothers received a prescription for a macrolide (erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin) or a penicillin at any time during their pregnancy. Children were followed from birth to 14 years, with a median follow-up of 5.8 years.Two other groups of children\u201482,314 whose mothers had received a macrolide or penicillin before pregnancy, and 53,735 siblings of children in the study cohort\u2014served as negative controls for the analysis.The main outcomes the researchers were looking for were major malformations such as heart, genital, and gastrointestinal defects, and neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Because of the association between macrolide use and cardiovascular issues, they hypothesized that macrolides might induce fetal cardiac arrhythmia and short-term fetal hypoxia, which can have long-term effects.Of the children in the study cohort, 8,632 (8.3%) were born to women prescribed a macrolide during pregnancy, and major malformations were recorded in 186 (21.55 per 1,000 live births). Of the 95,973 (91.7%) children born to women who were prescribed a penicillin, a major malformation was recorded in 1,666 (17.36 per 1,000 live births).After accounting for other factors, including maternal age, drug and alcohol use, and chronic medical treatments, the analysis found that macrolide use in the first trimester was associated with increased risk of any malformation compared with penicillin use (27.65 vs 17.65 per 1,000 live births; adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19 to 2.03), specifically cardiovascular malformations (10.60 vs 6.61 per 1,000 live births; aRR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.51).\"Assuming the associations are causal, we estimate that for every 1,000 mothers prescribed macrolides instead of penicillins during the first trimester, an additional 4.1 (95% confidence interval 0.4 to 9.4) children would have cardiovascular malformations; the corresponding figures for prescriptions during any trimester and genital malformations would be 1.7 (0.4 to 3.5),\" the authors of the study write.Macrolide prescribing in any trimester was associated with a 58% increased risk of genital malformations (4.75 vs 3.07 per 1,000 live births; aRR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.59). In addition, analysis of specific types of macrolides found that erythromycin in the first trimester was associated with an increased risk of any major malformation compared with penicillin (27.39 vs 17.65 per 1,000 live births; aRR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.99).The analysis found no significant associations between macrolides and any other specific malformations or neurodevelopmental disorders. And no significant associations between macrolides and adverse outcomes were found in the control groups.Use of antibiotics is common in pregnant women, with some estimates indicating as many as one in four women will be prescribed an antibiotic during pregnancy. Although the science on how pregnancy affects the immune system remains unsettled, some expecting mothers are more prone to infections, and pregnancy can make some infections more severe.The authors say that, given the widespread use of macrolides during pregnancy, international collaboration is urgently needed to further explore the issue.Get CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now\u00bbUnrestricted financial support provided byGrant support for ASP provided byBecome an underwriter\u00bbCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.Following recent reports of COVID-19 in Iran, British Columbia last night reported an infection in a traveler returning from Iran and Lebanon today reported an illness linked to an Iran traveler.And amid rising suspicions of undetected transmission in Iran plus reports of surges in South Korea and Japan, as well as new local transmission in Italy, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said the window of opportunity for containing the outbreak has narrowed.In a related development, disease modeling experts from Imperial College London said today in a new report that two thirds of cases exported from China have probably gone undetected.At a media briefing today, Tedros said the WHO-led international joint mission, which has been on the ground since last weekend, has visited Beijing, plus Sichuan and Guangdong provinces and will visit Wuhan tomorrow. He also announced six special WHO envoys who will provide advice to countries in different parts of the world.He also said the WHO is aware of China's change in case reporting, which reverts to only including lab-positive cases among the confirmed cases. Tedros added that the change provides better clarity, since some of the clinically confirmed cases may not reflect COVID-19 infections. He said China's switch back to the original reporting system might be a sign of improved lab-testing capacity.Over the past few days, Iran reported five COVID-19 cases, two of them fatal, and last night health officials in British Columbia announced presumed positive test findings in a woman in her 30s who recently returned from Iran. Authorities from BC's Fraser health region are tracing the contacts of the woman, who is in isolation at her home. The illness brings Canada's total to 9, of which 6 are from BC.In a similar development, Lebanon's health minister announced at a news conference today that the country had detected its first COVID-19 case, a 45-year-old woman who had arrived from Iran, Reuters reported. Authorities are following up on two other suspected cases.At a WHO telebriefing today, Jaouad Mahjour, MD, MPH, said the illness was detected among symptomatic cases during airport surveillance. He added that the WHO stands ready to provide technical assistance.Today, Iran's health ministry reported 13 more cases and 2 more deaths. Most are from Qom, where the country's first cases, both fatal, were detected. Officials said 7 are from Qom, 4 are from Tehran, and 2 are from Guilan. It said two of the newly reported patients died from the disease and that two more suspected cases are under investigation in Babylon, involving people who have a history of travel to Qom. Iran now has 18 cases, 4 of them fatal.Elsewhere in the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates reported 2 new cases involving people who had close contact with an infected person from China, raising its total to 11, the ministry said on Twitter today.South Korea today reported 100 more cases, raising its total to 204. Of the most recent cases, 85 are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus cluster, according to Kyodo News, which cited the country's health ministry. It added that 400 of the sect's 3,500 members have shown symptoms of the disease.Meanwhile, Japan has reported 21 more cases since yesterday, raising its total to 105. In a pair of health ministry summaries, one covering 9 cases and the other covering 12 cases, officials said the patients are from nine different locations: Hokkaido, Nagoya, Tokyo, Chiba, Fukuoka, Sagamihara, Isikawa, Saitama prefecture, and Okinawa.In Singapore, the health ministry reported one more case today, a contact of an earlier confirmed case. The country now has 86 cases, and so far, all but 8 are linked to known cases.In two separate reports today, Italy reported 16 cases, 14 in Lombardy region and 2 in neighboring Veneto region, Reuters reported. The ministry first reported 6 cases in Lombardy, which it said marked the first local transmission, then followed up with a report of 8 more.A separate news agency report said two illnesses were reported, but it's not clear if they're linked to the cases in Lombardy. Italy now has 19 cases.The WHO said in its latest situation report that over the past 24 hours it received reports of 127 new cases, raising the total outside of China to 1,200 , including 8 deaths, from 28 countries. Of those, 634 are related to Japan's Diamond Princess cruise ship cluster.Modeling experts from Imperial College London examined recent COVID-19 developments outside of China that suggest that two-thirds of cases exported from China's mainland have gone undetected, which could have triggered yet-undetected local spread of the virus.For their analysis, they estimated the likely size of the epidemic in Wuhan based on air traffic volume and the number of cases outside of China. Then they examined country rates of confirmed cases related to flight volume to gauge the sensitivity of different surveillance systems.Though travel restrictions from Wuhan and other parts of China may have reduced the number of travelers to and from China, their estimates still suggest that a significant number of exported cases (63% to 73%) have gone undetected.They said that differences in illness severity make some cases tough to detect. \"However, some countries have detected significantly fewer than would have been expected based on the volume of flight passengers arriving from Wuhan City, China,\" they wrote.The report is Imperial College London's sixth to address issues related to the COVID-19 epidemic.China's National Health Commission today reported 889 more cases, raising the country's overall total to 75,465. It also reported 118 more deaths and 231 fewer serious cases, raising those respective totals to 2,236 and 11,633, respectively.Shandong province, located on China's northeastern coast, has reported a spurt of 202 new cases over the past day, and at today's WHO media briefing, Tedros said health officials are seeking more information about the rise.In other developments in China:Get CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now\u00bbUnrestricted financial support provided byGrant support for ASP provided byBecome an underwriter\u00bbCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.Today officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned that although the agency is taking historic measures to slow the introduction of COVID-19 into the United States, the country should prepare for the possibility of community spread, as seen in China and neighboring Asian countries.\"The day may come when we may need to implement such measures as seen in Asia,\" Nancy Messonnier, MD, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a press conference, referencing the closing of businesses, schools, and churches in multiple countries where transmission is now occurring within the community.The remarks were made just one day after 14 American passengers who tested positive for the virus and were on the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan were flown to the US for further medical treatment, on chartered flights with healthy passengers.A total of 300 Americans who were aboard the Diamond Princess were repatriated on two flights chartered by the State Department this week. All passengers will be subjected to a 14-day quarantine upon their return to the United States.Media reports yesterday suggested the CDC did not approve of the movement of the sick passengers to the United States, but the transport was ordered by the State Department. In the Washington Post, reporters quoted sources saying the decision to fly the sick passengers was a nightmare scenario.Messonnier said the CDC will now track US cases of the novel coronavirus in two subsets to help quickly determine if community spread is taking place. Patients will be grouped into either a \"repatriated\" category or a separate category that represents cases related to individual travel or close case contact.\"We are keeping track of cases from repatriation because we do not believe those numbers accurately represent the picture of what is happening in the community,\" Messonnier said.As of today, the CDC said there have been 21 COVID-19 cases in repatriated Americans, including 18 in Diamond Princess passengers, and another 13 US cases related to travel or case contact, for a total of 31.Yesterday the University of Nebraska Medical Center confirmed that 11 of 13 Diamond Princess passengers tested positive for the coronavirus. Also yesterday, Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane also confirmed four Americans aboard the cruise ship who had the virus would be treated at that facility.Messonnier also said some Americans who were aboard the Diamond Princess are currently hospitalized in Japan, including some who are in serious condition. So far two Japanese passengers from the cruise ship who had COVID-19 died.The latest US case not linked to the Diamond Princess was confirmed in Humboldt County, California, yesterday and involves a patient who had recently traveled to mainland China. This marks the seventh case in California. There have also been single confirmed cases in Massachusetts, Washington state, Arizona, and Wisconsin. Illinois has reported two cases.A close contact of the Humboldt County patient also has symptoms, county officials said. Both the contact and the case-patient are doing well and self-isolating at home, according to the county's public health department.Get CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now\u00bbUnrestricted financial support provided byGrant support for ASP provided byBecome an underwriter\u00bbCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

            "headline": "Costa Mesa Officials Address Growing Concerns Over Possible Transfer Of Up To 50 Coronavirus Patients To City",
            "main_text": "COSTA MESA (CBSLA) \u2013 Costa Mesa city officials addressed the public Saturday regarding concerns over the possible transfer of confirmed coronavirus patients to the city.Mayor Katrina Foley said the city was blindsided by the federal government\u2019s plan to transfer coronavirus patients to Costa Mesa.At a press conference, officials including Mayor Katrina Foley gathered to answer questions about the injunction filed to block the CDC and the U.S. Department of Health from transferring as many as 50 patients who have tested positive for coronavirus from Sacramento to the city\u2019s Fairview Developmental Center.\u201cWe saw it on the news this morning,\u201d said Santa Ana resident William Hart, who attended the meeting. \u201cWe were shocked. We didn\u2019t know this was happening. My wife\u2019s been crying all day.\u201dFederal court papers filed Friday state that the federal government planned to transfer the patients from Travis Air Force Base on Sunday or Monday. Thursday night, Costa Mesa city officials began hearing of the plan to move between 30 and 50 patients to the state-owned land.Foley said the city was surprised to learn that the Fairview Developmental Center was being considered for a group of patients who have tested positive for coronavirus, and city leaders filed an injunction to block the transfer in an effort to protect residents.\u201cWe have a lot of activity in the area,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s not the kind of area that\u2019s isolated and that would be appropriate for quarantining people who have an infectious disease.\u201dA federal judge Friday granted the city of Costa Mesa\u2019s temporary restraining order requesting to block the transfer.The largest concern was the lack of information, despite the fact that the patients were expected to arrive in a matter of days, said Costa Mesa fire chief Dan Stefano.\u201cThere has not been an information flow, and in a situation like that, for us, it creates the greatest concern,\u201d he said.Officials said the patients are California residents and may be coming from the Diamond Princess cruise ship from which more than 300 U.S. citizens were removed Monday.City manager Loriann Farrell Harrison said the city needs to know more before feeling comfortable with the transfer.\u201cThe reason that we have followed through with an injunction is because we don\u2019t have a lot of information. We would like to know more about who the individuals are,\u201d she said.The California Health and Human Services Agency released a statement Saturday regarding the possible transfer of coronavirus patients to Costa Mesa.\u201cThe federal quarantine of former Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers at Travis Air Force Base remains a federal operation,\u201d the statement said. \u201cCalifornia has been working hard to support this federal effort in a way that ensures the public health and safety of our communities and the passengers themselves.\u201dAccording to the statement, the federal government has determined that anyone testing positive for coronavirus cannot stay at Travis Air Force Base, and the Fairview Developmental Center is one of the locations under consideration to quarantine the patients until the infection has cleared.\u201cIf Fairview were chosen, the federal government would be responsible for providing health care \u2013 easing the burden on our hospitals during flu season \u2013 and for providing robust security to ensure the public safety and public health of the surrounding community,\u201d the statement said.In the injunction, the city of Costa Mesa said it seeks to stop the transfer until \u201can adequate site survey has been conducted, the designated site has been determined suitable for this purpose, all necessary safeguards and precautions have been put in place, and the public and local government have been informed of all efforts to mitigate risk of transmission of the disease.\u201dThe temporary injunction holds off the transfer of patients until Monday, when a federal judge will hear the case.As of Feb. 21, the CDC had only confirmed 35 cases of coronavirus in the U.S., with California\u2019s confirmed total at 15.(\u00a9 Copyright 2020 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved. City News Service contributed to this report.)Cost Mesa might consider that an outbreak can happen in there area and to allow this Gov to house current patients where it si needed.It would be nice if the feds would work with the city government and to ensure that the facility is appropriate to not allow transference of this virus to Costa Mesa residents.  This is a health issue for everyone involved and I applaud CM in their efforts to protect the health & safety of their residents.When did the total number of confirmed covid-19 cases in the US jump from 34 to over 70?  This only proves that the CDC and the federal government are lying to the American people.  Somebody needs to be explaining themselves.Why can\u2019t they be taken to Miramar Air Base which is already housing quarantined persons? It almost seems like CV patients are being spread around as much as possible. We had 5 placed at Sacred Heart Hospital in Spokane Washington yesterday. Why couldn\u2019t they have been place in Seattle with the other CV patients? Giant train wreck happening\u2026.This story makes zero sense. The total # of confirmed cases in the U.S. is 35, yet you are stating that 70 confirmed cases are being transferred here. Dear God, follow a little Journalism 101 and get your facts straight before running your article, which is spreading false claims and creating undue stress on your readers.What if the patients say \u201cfine, we\u2019ll just head to our homes and conduct business as usual\u201d?  Cali is all peace and love until it\u2019s in their backyard.  Their current stance might make things worse.those infected need to be housed in quarantine on military bases.  how about Camp Pendleton or miramir as suggested above.You would have thought the Feds and local government would have a system in place knowing that at some point an epidemic like this was coming but nope.It\u2019s called depopulation. 1. The deep state wants this virus to hit hard. It is losing it\u2019s grip on power. It released the virus to cover itself. Epstein/Clinton child rape organization, Trump/Obama and their destruction of the economy. Bush/Clinton/Obama wars. The collapsing of societies due to all the failures and corruption of the government. 9/11 inside job to get everything going, etc\u2026 Basically they are trying to retain their power. They see Bernie getting elected and shutting down the military industrial complex. They are doing everything they can.The goal is to spread the virus, kill off enough people to create mass confusion, panic, etc and buy them time to do whatever insane things they are working on. If you notice, EVERY step of the way has been total \u201cincompetence\u201d. WHO, Cruise ship, etc along with complete fabrication of the numbers.2. The fact is that if you bring any infected people in to a location then that location becomes a ground zero for the infection. That is basic infectious diseases and virology 101 and just common sense. You see how they can\u2019t even quarantine the ship properly(watch the video by the Japanese doctor/scientist).3. The goal is to keep people in the dark long enough to maximize damage. If panic sets in too soon then people self-quarantine and that prevents the virus from spreading. Supplies will vanish and then people start rioting, etc\u2026  If they are not sick.When enough die then it makes it easier for the deep state to do whatever it is doing. One must connect all the pieces of the puzzle:9/11(inside job to justify attacking Muslims for Mossad), police state(it\u2019s been ramping up greatly last few years), All the elections fraud(Hillary, Buttigieg, etc), All the bailouts(Obama/Wallstreet/Big banks), All the wars, The destruction of the healthcare system(Obama), The \u201cspace force\u201d(Trump), etc\u2026 and so much more that you don\u2019t know about.99% of government is a jobs program to boost employment numbers and make it look like the economy is not as bad as it is. It\u2019s full of clueless people that only follow orders and care nothing about helping society, it\u2019s just a job to them, and easy job with lots of benefits and no accountability.The purpose of releasing the virus in China was because it would be a super spreader event(due to their amassing for the NY) and give cover(wet market theory which is total BS) and severely weaken China. [We don\u2019t know if it was done by the deep state or they are just capitalizing on it or if all this is just due to the pure ignorance of the US government. China could have done it to weaken the US(yes, because it can control the outbreak much easier and save far more than US can, so it sacrifices a little to gain a lot). It could have been released by any number of governments or terrorist organizations and they could release more]Any case, all we can do is sit back and watch the building fall. Who you let lead you, it turns out, does matter, who would have thunk it?Is a blessing from the SATAN to Governments,that struggle greatly for luck of funds,for Social Security,PENSION payments,to the \u201cuseless Eaters\u201d,thats me over 60",

The top three best-selling products included instant noodles, rice, and milk powder.The e-commerce platform believes, according to a CNA report, that people are choosing to eat at home rather than dine out. Instant noodles and rice are popular items, while milk powder for infants is also selling fast.Buy123, an e-tailer owned by KuoBrothers, has experienced a similar boost, with sales of prepared food climbing by up to 30 percent over the past two weeks. The company's top three food items are said to be dumplings, rice, pizza, and scallion pancakes.The news agency pointed out PChome recently advertised 200 job opportunities, with engineers and logistics specialists among the most wanted. KuoBrothers is also recruiting engineers through Taiwan's biggest job-hunting site, 104.com, with the highest monthly salary NT$100,000 ($3,289.26) per month.On the other hand, bricks and mortar retailers are facing a first quarter challenge. Department stores in Taipei's Xinyi District said sales had tanked 40 to 70 percent due to decreasing footfall.Breeze is said to be dismissing up to 30 percent of its workforce, the largest ever annual organizational adjustment. More than 100 workers will be affected, UDN reported.Updated : 2020-03-15 15:36 GMT+08:00Taiwan News  \u00a9  2019 All Rights Reserved.",

            "main_text": "The Health Ministry on Saturday said nine South Koreans tested positive for the coronavirus after a recent visit to Israel.\nThe Koreans were in Israel from February 8-15 and were confirmed to have the virus upon their return to South Korea, according to a statement from the ministry.\n    \n\n\n            if(typeof rgb_remove_toi_dfp_banner != \"function\" || !rgb_remove_toi_dfp_banner(\"#div-gpt-ad-336x280_Middle_1\")){\n                googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-336x280_Middle_1\"); });\n            };\n        \n\nThe ministry called on anyone who was in close contact with the Koreans to report this and self-quarantine for 14 days from the date of their last interaction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFree Sign Up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nIt also posted a list of places the group visited, among them Netanya, Caesaria, Nazareth, the Sea of Galilee, the Dead Sea, Beersheba, Jerusalem and the West Bank city of Hebron.\nThe statement from the ministry came shortly after a BBC reporter in Seoul said seven South Koreans from a tour group to Israel of 77 organized by the Catholic Church tested positive for the virus upon their return home.\nIt was not clear whether they were carrying the virus when they arrived in Israel. Symptoms of the virus can take up to two weeks, and possibly longer, to present. South Korea has reported over 400 cases of the virus to date.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to clarify if someone from the local churches was in contact with them [the South Koreans],\u201d Wadih Abu Al-Nasr, the Vatican\u2019s spokesman in Israel, told Channel 13 news.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping they weren\u2019t infected in Israel. I wish them a speedy recovery and hope and pray that none of our people here were infected by this problematic virus,\u201d he added.\nThe manager of a Jerusalem hotel where the group stayed during its visit told Channel 12 that staff that cleaned the group\u2019s rooms had been instructed by the Health Ministry to self quarantine.\n\u201cOther hotel workers must report if they feel ill or develop any symptoms,\u201d he said. He added that employees were calm.\nThe Israel Nature and Parks Authority confirmed the group visited the national parks Tel Beersheva, Masada and Caesaria.\n\u201cInstructions were given to employees at the sites who were in contact [with the South Koreans],\u201d it said in a statement.\nThe report comes a day after Israel reported its first case of the novel COVID-19 virus, an Israeli woman who returned to the country after being quarantined on a cruise ship off Japan that saw a large number of infections.\nSouth Korea on Saturday reported an eight-fold jump in viral infections in four days to 433, most of them linked to a church and a hospital in and around the country\u2019s fourth-largest city, where health workers scrambled to screen more than 9,000 worshipers.\n\n7 of South Korea\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases had just returned from an 8 day trip to Israel. 77 people were on the holiday organised by their Catholic Church.\n\u2014 Laura Bicker (@BBCLBicker) February 22, 2020\nThere\u2019s concern that the death toll, currently at two, could grow. Virus patients with signs of pneumonia or other serious conditions at the Cheongdo hospital were transferred to other facilities, 17 of them in critical condition, Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told reporters.\nHe said that the outbreak had entered a serious new phase, but still expressed cautious optimism that it can be contained to the region surrounding Daegu, where the first case was reported on Tuesday.\nIn some positive news, China said Saturday the daily count of new virus cases there fell significantly to 397, though another 109 people died of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Most of the new cases and all but three of the deaths were in Hubei province, where the outbreak started.\nHowever, in a troubling sign, Hubei\u2019s government reported Saturday that a man showed symptoms of the virus 27 days after being infected, according to Reuters, nearly double the estimated incubation time of 14 days.\n\nA passenger has her temperature taken by airport health staff with an infrared thermometer after arriving at Hong Kong International Airport on February 21, 2020. (Vivek Prakash/AFP)\n\nThe new figures, along with an upward revision of Hubei\u2019s earlier count, brought the total number of cases in mainland China to 76,288 with 2,345 deaths.

The virus has been named \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d and the disease it causes has been named \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d (abbreviated \u201cCOVID-19\u201d).On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concernexternal icon\u201d (PHEIC). On January 31, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency (PHE) for the United States to aid the nation\u2019s healthcare community in responding to COVID-19. On March 11, WHO publiclyexternal icon\u00a0characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. On March 13, the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergencyexternal icon.Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. \u00a0All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.Early on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Person-to-person spread was subsequently reported outside Hubei and in countries outside China, including in the United States. Some international destinations now have ongoing community spread\u00a0with the virus that causes COVID-19, as do some parts of the United States. Community spread means some people have been infected and it is not known how or where they became exposed.

Reported illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, a reportexternal icon out of China suggests serious illness occurs in 16% of cases. Older people and people of all ages with severe chronic medical conditions \u2014 like heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, for example \u2014 seem to be at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.Learn more about the symptoms associated with COVID-19.A pandemic is a global outbreak of disease. Pandemics happen when a new virus emerges to infect people and can spread between people sustainably. Because there is little to no pre-existing immunity against the new virus, it spreads worldwide.The virus that causes COVID-19 is infecting people and spreading easily from person-to-person. Cases have been detected in most countries worldwide and community spread is being detected in a growing number of countries. On March 11, the COVID-19 outbreak was characterized as a pandemic by the WHOexternal icon.This is the first pandemic known to be caused by the emergence of a new coronavirus. In the past century, there have been four pandemics caused by the emergence of novel influenza viruses. As a result, most research and guidance around pandemics is specific to influenza, but the same premises can be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemics of respiratory disease follow a certain progression outlined in a \u201cPandemic Intervals Framework.\u201d Pandemics begin with an investigation phase, followed by recognition, initiation, and acceleration phases. The peak of illnesses occurs at the end of the acceleration phase, which is followed by a deceleration phase, during which there is a decrease in illnesses. Different countries can be in different phases of the pandemic at any point in time and different parts of the same country can also be in different phases of a pandemic.There are ongoing investigations to learn more. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.Different parts of the country are seeing different levels of COVID-19 activity. The United States nationally is currently in the initiation phases, but states where community spread is occurring are in the acceleration phase. The duration and severity of each phase can vary depending on the characteristics of the virus and the public health response.Risk depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people; the severity of resulting illness; and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccines or medications that can treat the illness) and the relative success of these. In the absence of vaccine or treatment medications, nonpharmaceutical interventions become the most important response strategy. These are community interventions that can reduce the impact of disease.The risk from COVID-19 to Americans can be broken down into risk of exposure versus risk of serious illness and death.Risk of exposure:Risk of Severe Illness:Early information out of China, where COVID-19 first started, shows that some people are at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness. This includes:CDC has developed guidance to help in the risk assessment and management\u00a0of people with potential exposures to COVID-19.More cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified in the United States in the coming days, including more instances of community spread. CDC expects that widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the United States will occur. In the coming months, most of the U.S. population will be exposed to this virus.Widespread transmission of COVID-19 could translate into large numbers of people needing medical care at the same time. Schools, childcare centers, and workplaces, may experience more absenteeism. Mass gatherings may be sparsely attended or postponed. Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths. Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, and sectors of the transportation industry may also be affected. Healthcare providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed. At this time, there is no vaccine to protect against COVID-19 and no medications approved to treat it.\u00a0Nonpharmaceutical interventions will be the most important response strategy to try to delay the spread of the virus and reduce the impact of disease.Global efforts at this time are focused concurrently on lessening the spread and impact of this virus. The federal government is working closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial partners, as well as public health partners, to respond to this public health threat.CDC is implementing its pandemic preparedness and response plans, working on multiple fronts, including providing specific guidance on measures to\u00a0prepare communities\u00a0to respond to local spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. There is an abundance of\u00a0pandemic guidance\u00a0developed in anticipation of an influenza pandemic that is being adapted for a potential COVID-19 pandemic.This is a picture of CDC\u2019s laboratory test kit for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

            "main_text": "AdvertisementFOLLOW ONThis undated electron microscope image made available by the U.S. National Institutes of Health in February 2020 shows the Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Also known as 2019-nCoV, the virus causes COVID-19. The sample was isolated from a patient in the U.S. (NIAID-RML via AP)SHAREOTTAWA -- \n\tCanadian medical experts say the country's already overstretched emergency rooms would find it difficult to cope if a true outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, were to take hold in Canada.So far, the virus has been relatively contained to mainland China, thanks in part to one of the largest quarantines in modern history.\u201cWe must not look back and regret that we failed to take advantage of the window of opportunity that we have now,\u201d Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, said in a message to all the world's countries Friday.The risk of contracting the virus in Canada right now is extremely low, and public health officials have been lauded for their efforts to detect and isolate the nine cases confirmed in the country so far.The hundreds of patients across the country who have tested negative for the virus are also a sign that containment efforts are working as they should.But Canada's most recent case in British Columbia has raised fears about where and how the disease is being transmitted abroad. Unlike others who've imported the virus from China or from people who have recently been to China, the woman in her 30s contracted the illness while in Iran.\u201cAny imported cases linked to Iran could be an indicator that there is more widespread transmission than we know about,\u201d said Canada's chief medical officer Dr. Theresa Tam Friday.Canada has taken major steps to prevent the kind of shock that befell Ontario during the outbreak of the coronavirus known as SARS in 2003 that led to 44 deaths. Creating the Public Health Agency of Canada, which Tam heads, is one of them.The country is now better co-ordinated, has increased its lab-testing capabilities and is prepared to trace people's contacts to find people who might have caught a contagious illness without knowing it.But once the number of incoming cases reaches a critical mass, the approach must change, according to infectious-diseases physician Dr. Isaac Bogoch of Toronto's University Health Network.He likens the response to trying to catch fly balls in the outfield: as the number of balls in the air increases, they become harder and harder to snag.\u201cEvery health care system has limits,\u201d Bogoch says. \u201cThe question is, if we start getting inundated with cases, how stretched can we get?\u201dMany emergency-room doctors argue Canada's ERs are already as stretched as they can get and are worried about what would happen if they suddenly had to start treating COVID-19 cases en masse.From the public-health perspective, the greatest challenge may be as simple communicating across all parts of the health system across the country, said Dr. Jasmine Pawa, president of the Public Health Physicians of Canada.\u201cWe cover a very wide geographic area,\u201d she said, though she added that Canada has made great strides over the course of the SARS experience and the H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009.Dr. Alan Drummond of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, who works at the hospital in Perth, Ont., says he doesn't want to fearmonger, especially considering all the lessons Canada has learned from past outbreaks, but the reality of life in the ER gives him pause.\u201cOur day-to-day experience in crowded hospitals, unable to get the right patient in the right bed on a day-to-day basis \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 makes us really question what the integrity of our health-care system would be like in a major severe pandemic,\u201d Drummond says.He envisions that a disease like COVID-19, if it spread widely, would have a major impact, including the possibility of cancelled surgeries and moving stable patients out of hospitals who would otherwise stay.\u201cI think there would have to be hard decisions made about who lives and who dies, given our limited availability by both speciality and (intensive-care) beds and we would probably see some degree of health-care rationing,\u201d he says.The problem may be even more pronounced because of Canada's aging population, he said. The virus tends to hit older people harder, according to observations made in China and abroad, and is also particularly dangerous for people with other health problems.Older people also tend to stay admitted in hospital beds even when they are in relatively stable condition because of a lack of long-term-care beds across the country.That keeps emergency rooms from being able to move acute patients out of the ER and into those beds, limiting hospitals' capacity to handle new cases.Tam agreed Friday that hospital capacity is a \u201ccritical aspect\u201d of Canada's preparedness for a potential coronavirus outbreak, but said even very bad flu seasons can have a similar effect on emergency rooms.\u201cIf we can delay the impact of the coronavirus until a certain period, when there's less influenza for example, that would also be very helpful,\u201d she said.She also suggested people who are concerned about the possibility that they're developing COVID-19 symptoms should call ahead to a hospital so they can make proper arrangements for containment and isolation.Canada is doing its best, along with every other country in the world, to seize this time of relative containment and plan ahead, Tam said.This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 22, 2020.SHAREAdvertisementUse of this Website assumes acceptance of Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy\u00a9 2020All rights reserved.Back to top",

In addition, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) became the third country to report Iran-linked cases.In other developments, China reported more cases and added to its death total, and officials in the United States detailed plans to house evacuees and test surveillance samples.In the wake of warning earlier this week that the window for containing COVID-19 has narrowed, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, met with African health ministers in an emergency meeting about preparedness, which was organized by the African Union and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.The WHO has voiced deep concern over the potential spread of the virus to countries with weak health systems, especially those in Africa.Though 80% of patients have mild disease and recover, the other 20% have severe or critical disease, he said in a speech today before the group. \"These patients require intensive care, using equipment such as respiratory support machines that are, as you know, in short supply in many African countries. And that's a cause for concern.\"In two separate reports today, South Korea's Centers for Disease Control (KCDC) first reported 142 cases then reported 87 more for a total of 433, more than double the 204 reported yesterday. Of the new cases, 100 are from a Shincheonji Church of Jesus cluster, and 95 are linked to a cluster at Qingdao Daenam Hospital in Cheongdo County. Health officials also reported South Korea's second death from the virus.The KCDC also published a summary of its first 346 cases, which shows that 48.8% are linked to the church cluster and 31.2% are linked to the hospital cluster.It also has details about the hospital outbreak, which is centered in the facility's psychiatric ward and has so far sickened 9 staff and 102 patients. South Korea's two deaths are linked to the hospital outbreak. The report also notes that transmission linked to the church likely reflects repeated exposures, such as during small group meetings.Meanwhile, Japan's health ministry today reported 22 more cases, raising the country's total to 113, though it also notes an overall total of 132 that includes 16 asymptomatic carriers and 3 confirmed positives.The cases span 10 locations: Kumamoto City, Kumamoto Prefecture, Wakayama Prefecture, Chiba Prefecture, Hokkaido, Ishikawa Prefecture, Tokyo, Nagoya, Tochigi Prefecture, and Sagamihara.In Singapore, the health ministry reported 3 more cases, raising the country's total to 89. One of the new cases is linked to a church cluster, one involves an evacuee from Wuhan, and the exposure source is under investigation for the third case. In total, only 9 of Singapore's cases don't have links to other cases.Iran today reported 10 new cases, 1 of them fatal, The News International reported today, citing a health ministry spokesman. Eight patients are hospitalized in Qom, the country's epicenter, with two hospitalized in Tehran.Iran reported its first cases, both fatal, on Feb 20, and today's developments lift the country's total to 28 cases, 5 of them fatal.In a related development, the UAE today reported two cases, involving a couple who had traveled from Iran, according to a health ministry tweet. One of the patients is a 70-year-old man who being treated in an intensive care unit, and the other is his 64-year-old wife. The UAE now has 13 cases.Italy today reported as many as 11 new cases in its steadily growing outbreak, and there are now 2 fatalities, Reuters reported today, citing healthcare sources quoted in an ANSA news agency report.Italy now has 30 cases in the northern part of the country, 27 of them in Lombardy region. The latest death occurred in a woman from Lombardy.In China, members of an international joint mission led by the WHO is in Wuhan today with their Chinese colleagues to assess the situation. The group has also visited Beijing, plus Sichuan and Guangdong provinces.The country's National Health Commission today reported 397 new cases today, down from 889 reported yesterday, for a total of 76,288.Officials also reported 109 more deaths and 156 fewer suspected cases, putting those respective totals at 2,345 and 11,477.In US developments, the California city of Costa Mesa has won federal injunction that temporarily bars the transfer of people quarantined at Travis Air Force Base to a state-owned building in Costa Mesa, according to an NBC News report.City officials said about 30 to 50 people, reportedly those who tested positive for the virus, were slated to arrive at the facility as early as Feb 23. The building was once an assisted-living facility for people with disabilities. An expedited hearing is slated for Feb 24.Meanwhile, federal officials have added a sixth site\u2014Honolulu\u2014 to its surveillance system for COVID-19, Anthony Fauci, MD, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during an interview yesterday on CNBC.A recently reported Japanese patient had traveled to Hawaii before he became ill. Last week, federal officials announced the first phase of a plan to look for people who may be infected with the disease at flu surveillance sentinel sites in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, and New York City.Health officials will test negative flu specimens for the virus that causes COVID-19.Get CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now\u00bbUnrestricted financial support provided byGrant support for ASP provided byBecome an underwriter\u00bbCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

            "main_text": "Recommendations and Reports / April 21, 2017 / 66(1);1\u201334Noreen Qualls, DrPH1; Alexandra Levitt, PhD2; Neha Kanade, MPH1,3; Narue Wright-Jegede, MPH1,4; Stephanie Dopson, ScD5; Matthew Biggerstaff, MPH6; Carrie Reed, DSc6; Amra Uzicanin, MD1 (View author affiliations)Views equals page views plus PDF downloadsFigure 1Figure 2Figure 3Figure 4Figure 5Figure 6Table 1Table 2Table 3Table 4Table 5Table 6Table 7Table 8Table 9Table 10When a novel influenza A virus with pandemic potential emerges, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) often are the most readily available interventions to help slow transmission of the virus in communities, which is especially important before a pandemic vaccine becomes widely available. NPIs, also known as community mitigation measures, are actions that persons and communities can take to help slow the spread of respiratory virus infections, including seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses.These guidelines replace the 2007 Interim Pre-pandemic Planning Guidance: Community Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Mitigation in the United States \u2014 Early, Targeted, Layered Use of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/11425). Several elements remain unchanged from the 2007 guidance, which described recommended NPIs and the supporting rationale and key concepts for the use of these interventions during influenza pandemics. NPIs can be phased in, or layered, on the basis of pandemic severity and local transmission patterns over time. Categories of NPIs include personal protective measures for everyday use (e.g., voluntary home isolation of ill persons, respiratory etiquette, and hand hygiene); personal protective measures reserved for influenza pandemics (e.g., voluntary home quarantine of exposed household members and use of face masks in community settings when ill); community measures aimed at increasing social distancing (e.g., school closures and dismissals, social distancing in workplaces, and postponing or cancelling mass gatherings); and environmental measures (e.g., routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces).Several new elements have been incorporated into the 2017 guidelines. First, to support updated recommendations on the use of NPIs, the latest scientific evidence available since the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 pandemic has been added. Second, a summary of lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response is presented to underscore the importance of broad and flexible prepandemic planning. Third, a new section on community engagement has been included to highlight that the timely and effective use of NPIs depends on community acceptance and active participation. Fourth, to provide new or updated pandemic assessment and planning tools, the novel influenza virus pandemic intervals tool, the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool, the Pandemic Severity Assessment Framework, and a set of prepandemic planning scenarios are described. Finally, to facilitate implementation of the updated guidelines and to assist states and localities with prepandemic planning and decision-making, this report links to six supplemental prepandemic NPI planning guides for different community settings that are available online (https://www.cdc.gov/nonpharmaceutical-interventions).TopNonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are strategies for disease, injury, and exposure control (https://www.cdc.gov/phpr/capabilities/DSLR_capabilities_July.pdfpdf icon). They include actions that persons and communities can take to help slow the spread of respiratory viruses (e.g., seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses). These actions include personal protective measures for everyday use (e.g., staying home when ill, covering coughs and sneezes, and washing hands often) and communitywide measures reserved for pandemics and aimed at reducing opportunities for exposure (e.g., coordinated closures and dismissals of child care facilities and schools and cancelling mass gatherings). When a novel influenza A virus with pandemic potential emerges, NPIs can be used in conjunction with available pharmaceutical interventions (antiviral medications) to help slow its transmission in communities, especially when a vaccine is not yet widely available. Given current vaccine technology, a pandemic vaccine might not be available for up to 6 months (https://www.fda.gov/%20ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm336267.htmexternal icon). NPIs can be used before a pandemic is declared in areas where a novel influenza A virus is detected and during a pandemic.These 2017 guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations on the use of NPIs in mitigating the effects of pandemic influenza. These guidelines update and expand the 2007 strategy (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/11425).*TopThe purpose of these guidelines is to help state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments with prepandemic planning and decision-making by providing updated recommendations on the use of NPIs. These recommendations have incorporated lessons learned from the federal, state, and local responses to the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus pandemic (hereafter referred to as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic) and findings from research. Communities, families and individuals, employers, and schools can create plans that use these interventions to help slow the spread of a pandemic and prevent disease and death.Specific goals for implementing NPIs early in a pandemic include slowing acceleration of the number of cases in a community, reducing the peak number of cases during the pandemic and related health care demands on hospitals and infrastructure, and decreasing overall cases and health effects ( Figure 1). When a pandemic begins, public health authorities need to decide on an appropriate set of NPIs for implementation and to reiterate the importance of personal protective measures for everyday use (e.g., voluntary home isolation of ill persons [staying home when ill], respiratory etiquette, and hand hygiene) and environmental cleaning measures (e.g., routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces), which are recommended at all times for prevention of respiratory illnesses ( Table 1). Personal protective measures reserved for pandemics (e.g., voluntary home quarantine of exposed household members [staying home when a household member is ill] and use of face masks by ill persons) also might be recommended (Table 1). A more difficult decision is how and when to implement community-level NPIs that might be warranted but are more disruptive (e.g., temporary school closures and dismissals, social distancing in workplaces and the community, and cancellation of mass gatherings) (Table 1). These decisions are made by state and local officials on the basis of conditions in the applicable jurisdictions, with guidance from CDC (according to pandemic severity and potential efficacy) and governing authorities (1). Prepandemic planning, along with community engagement, is an essential component of these decisions ( Table 2).The decision regarding whether and when to recommend additional NPIs is another component ( Table 3). State and local public health departments might use certain influenza surveillance indicators to help decide when to consider implementing NPIs such as school closures and dismissals and other social distancing measures in schools, workplaces, and public settings during an influenza pandemic. The choice of influenza surveillance indicators might differ among states and localities, depending on the availability and capacity of their public health resources. Examples of possible influenza surveillance indicators include additional patient visits to health care providers for influenza-like illness (ILI) and increased geographic spread of influenza within a state. Indicators for school closures and dismissals might include increased school absenteeism rates or the earliest laboratory-confirmed influenza cases among students, teachers, or staff members. Indicators that might help confirm that NPI implementation should continue include increased influenza-associated hospitalizations or increases in adult or pediatric deaths attributed to influenza. Additional information about NPI prepandemic planning is available (supplementary Chapter 1 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313).TopAn influenza pandemic occurs when a novel virus emerges for which the majority of the population has little or no immunity. Influenza pandemics are facilitated by sustained human-to-human transmission, and the infection spreads worldwide over a relatively short period (2). The first influenza pandemic of the 21st century began in 2009, 2 years after the 2007 strategy for prepandemic planning was published. Lessons learned during the response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic underscored the importance of a flexible approach to the use of NPIs, particularly during the early stages of a pandemic, and led to the development of new tools for assessing pandemic severity and prepandemic planning ( Box 1).The 2009 H1N1 pandemic was a reminder to be prepared for the unpredictable nature of pandemics. Knowing in advance which subtype of pandemic virus will emerge is impossible, as is where and when it will emerge, how quickly the virus will spread, how severe the illness will be, and who will be the most affected. Because of this unpredictability, prepandemic planning must be broad and flexible.The 2007 strategy for prepandemic planning was developed with the assumption that the next influenza pandemic would be severe, like the 1957 pandemic, which was characterized by high transmissibility and medium clinical severity. When the 2007 strategy was developed, the primary concern was that a pandemic virus might evolve from the highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, a virus that reemerged in Asia in 2003 in domestic poultry and spread to Africa, the Middle East, and Europe among poultry, with sporadic zoonotic transmission (37). Moreover, CDC thought that this virus would most likely emerge overseas, providing the United States with time to prepare for a domestic response, including making use of prepandemic H5N1 vaccine in CDC\u2019s Strategic National Stockpile. Instead, the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus turned out to be a novel H1N1 virus that appears to have emerged in southern Mexico and was first identified in two persons in California (13). Although the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in the United States was moderate in terms of overall morbidity and mortality among the U.S. general population, severe outcomes from H1N1pdm09 virus infection were more common among children, young adults, and specific groups at risk for serious complications (e.g., pregnant women) than among older adults (Box 1).Although the emergence of the H1N1pdm09 virus prompted development of pandemic vaccines, a pandemic vaccine was not available until October 2009, 6 months after the initial report that identified the pandemic virus. In addition, another 2 months were required (December 2009) for sufficient stocks to be manufactured, distributed, and available to vaccinate several population groups, including school-aged children and persons living with or caring for infants aged <6 months, as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).\u2020 Even though work is ongoing to accelerate the pace of development, distribution, and administration of a vaccine during future pandemics, this experience reaffirmed the importance of the use of NPIs in the early stages of a pandemic before a well-matched vaccine is widely available (i.e., vaccines produced using a virus that is very similar to the circulating virus).Another lesson learned about NPI implementation during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was that rapidly changing guidance can create confusion and difficulties during implementation (Box 1) (30,31). Nevertheless, field studies found that school-related NPIs, including school closures recommended to mitigate the impact of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic during spring 2009, were considered acceptable and feasible for most parents and caregivers, even when parents had to miss work and in the absence of free or reduced-cost school lunches for students (28,38\u201341). Other interventions that reduced the spread of H1N1pdm09 virus in some communities included hand hygiene (42), regularly scheduled school summer breaks (19), and social distancing measures, such as cancelling mass gatherings and closing public places (22).The 2009 H1N1 pandemic underscored that effective prepandemic planning requires the involvement of public health and local leaders, employers, organizations, and stakeholders and is essential to ensure timely and effective use of NPIs to limit disease spread during a pandemic ( Box 2). Effective use of NPIs depends on the acceptance and participation of individual persons who implement personal protective measures and of communities that implement communitywide measures such as temporary school closures (https://www.cdc.gov/phpr/capabilities/DSLR_capabilities_July.pdfpdf icon).The 2007 guidance took into account the results of a 2006 opinion poll conducted with a representative national sample of 1,697 adults aged \u226518 years. The results indicated that when faced with an outbreak of pandemic influenza, the majority of persons in the United States would be willing to make major changes in their lives and cooperate with public health recommendations on the use of NPIs (http://archive.sph.harvard.edu/press-releases/2006-releases/press10262006.htmlexternal icon). Findings were similar in a follow-up study during the 2009\u20132010 H1N1 pandemic (Box 1) (https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/horp/project-on-the-public-response-to-h1n1external icon).For example, in 2006, 85% of the respondents said that they and all members of their household would stay home for 7\u201310 days if another household member were ill with pandemic influenza. The H1N1 opinion polls also identified barriers to implementation of NPIs among persons and communities (e.g., the ability to stay home when ill, job security, and income protection) (https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/horp/project-on-the-public-response-to-h1n1external icon). States and localities could establish local planning councils or hold public engagement meetings that address these and other issues related to public health preparedness, pandemic education, and planning. States and local communities also can draw on planning guidance provided in the CDC Public Health Preparedness Capabilities: National Standards for State and Local Planning, which lists NPIs as one of 15 capabilities (https://www.cdc.gov/phpr/capabilities/DSLR_capabilities_July.pdfpdf icon). Additional information about pandemic influenza and NPI community engagement is available (supplementary Chapter 1 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313).In 2014, CDC updated its 2008 guidance on pandemic intervals to include six intervals that describe influenza pandemic progression in a way that supports flexible prepandemic preparedness and response. The intervals include 1) investigation of novel influenza cases, 2) recognition of potential for ongoing transmission, 3) initiation, 4) acceleration, 5) deceleration of the pandemic wave, and 6) preparation for a future pandemic wave (43). These intervals can be used during prepandemic planning and can serve as a platform for public health decision-making and actions during the beginning of a potential influenza pandemic. Each interval is associated with particular response activities, including implementation of select NPIs during the initiation and acceleration intervals and coordinated discontinuation of select community-level NPIs reserved for pandemics during the deceleration interval ( Figure 2) ( Table 4). Although the six-interval framework describes the sequence of pandemic disease evolution over time, the framework does not characterize the transmissibility of the virus or the clinical severity of the outbreak. Therefore, CDC has developed additional tools for pandemic planning and response, including the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (supplementary Chapter 2 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313); https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/tools/risk-assessment.htm) and the Pandemic Severity Assessment Framework (PSAF). Additional information about the pandemic intervals is available (supplementary Chapter 2 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313).An influenza pandemic can range from mild to extremely severe in terms of clinical severity and transmission rate. When a pandemic emerges, public health authorities should assess its projected impact and recommend rapid action to reduce virus transmission, protect populations at high risk for complications, and minimize societal disruption. As observed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response, attack rates and case-fatality ratios can be difficult to measure early in a pandemic because of variations in care-seeking behavior and testing practices; not everyone seeks care for their illness, and not everyone is tested and receives a diagnosis of pandemic influenza. As a result, severe cases might be more likely to be reported, resulting in an overestimate of the case-hospitalization or case-fatality ratio. Tools for prepandemic planning have been updated and augmented based on that experience, and the Pandemic Severity Index in the 2007 guidance has been replaced with PSAF. PSAF uses multiple clinical and epidemiologic indicators to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the transmissibility and clinical severity of an emerging pandemic. Whereas the Pandemic Severity Index was based on the assumption that a future pandemic would cause an illness rate of 30% in the U.S. population and relied on an assessment of case-fatality ratios to determine severity of an evolving pandemic, PSAF incorporates multiple measures of clinical severity (e.g., case-fatality ratios, case-hospitalization ratios, and deaths-hospitalizations ratios) and viral transmissibility (e.g., secondary household attack rates, school attack rates, workplace attack rates, community attack rates, or all of these, as well as rates of emergency department and outpatient visits for ILI) (44).When a pandemic begins, in the United States or anywhere in the world, CDC makes an initial assessment of viral transmissibility and clinical severity on the basis of these multiple PSAF measures ( Table 5) (44). On the basis of the initial assessment, CDC recommends that affected U.S. jurisdictions respond (and other jurisdictions prepare to respond). Although data are limited during the initial 3\u20134 weeks after the emergence of a pandemic virus, these early data are compiled into a broad, preliminary assessment. CDC uses PSAF scores of viral transmissibility and clinical severity to place the pandemic within one of four assessment quadrants ( Figure 3). Depending on the surveillance capacity in the location where the novel virus emerges and first spreads, 4\u20138 weeks or longer might be required to accrue sufficient data for a refined assessment of an evolving pandemic. Once data are available, the refined assessment is used to more precisely characterize the clinical severity and transmissibility of the pandemic virus ( Figure 4) ( Table 6). These initial and refined assessments of pandemic severity are used, in coordination with state and local public health partners, to guide the use of NPI measures. Additional information about PSAF is available (supplementary Chapter 2 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313).TopThis 2017 update consists of three separate documents: this report and two supplementary documents (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313 and https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44314). This report provides a brief introduction to pandemic influenza and NPIs; describes the 2007 strategy and the purpose of the updates, particularly after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic; outlines the methods used to develop this update and describe the evidence considered for NPI use during an influenza pandemic; presents CDC\u2019s NPI recommendations; and discusses key areas for further NPI research. The two supplementary documents contain more specific and detailed information about pandemic influenza and NPIs. One document (Technical Report 1 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313) is divided into chapters and provides an introduction to and overview of NPIs, a description of the new tools developed for pandemic influenza planning and assessment, and a toolbox describing the NPI evidence base, implementation issues, and research gaps. The second document (Technical Report 2 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44314) consists of several appendices that provide a glossary of terms, a detailed description of the methods used for developing the NPI recommendations, a comprehensive summary table of the NPI body of evidence, and a list of tools and resources for pandemic influenza planning and preparedness.This 2017 update was developed through collaboration involving input from several sources, including peer-reviewed scientific literature, current research, CDC subject-matter experts, and external stakeholders (e.g., federal agencies, public health officials, and business and education partners). Development of these updated guidelines involved participation by multiple CDC groups (e.g., the Community Mitigation Guidelines Work Group and the coordination, abstraction, and consultation teams), as well as a group of external stakeholders who reviewed a document, summarizing the overall direction and key principles and concepts of the guidelines. Input from the work group members, subject-matter experts, and stakeholders was considered and incorporated during the creation of the 2017 planning guidelines. The guidelines were developed during October 2011\u2013October 2016 ( Table 7). The complete list of contributors and their roles in the process are available (supplementary Appendix 2 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44314).Ten years ago, when the 2007 strategy was being developed, the evidence for the use of NPIs during influenza pandemics was limited, consisting primarily of historical analyses and contemporary observations rather than controlled scientific studies (45,46). These analyses and observations were supplemented by modeling studies that used historical data to evaluate NPI use in U.S. cities during the 1918 pandemic (47,48) or that simulated pandemic scenarios as they might occur in the future (49\u201351). The simulations, like the historical analyses, generally supported the effectiveness of early, targeted, and phased-in (layered) use of multiple NPIs\u00a7 in preventing spread of disease, especially when used in combination with antiviral medications (46,49). This conclusion seemed plausible, confirming the presumption that individual, partially effective NPIs act in complementary ways to decrease various factors that facilitate the spread of influenza under different circumstances and settings (52). However, the NPI modeling studies had substantial limitations, including lack of data supporting assumptions about the effectiveness of individual NPIs, economic and social costs of NPIs, and likely rates of compliance (46,49,53).In 2016, the evidence supporting the effectiveness of NPIs, both when used alone and in combination, was more substantial and included controlled studies evaluating different NPIs. New modeling studies based on data collected during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response also became available. This update is based on approximately 191 journal articles written in English and published from 1990 through September 2016 that focused on personal protective measures in general; school closure effectiveness and unintended consequences; school absenteeism; spread of disease in child care facilities, colleges, and universities; impact of mass gatherings; and role and impact of NPIs in non\u2013health care workplace settings. These articles were reviewed, abstracted, and synthesized. To assess the strength of the evidence, a five-step NPI rating scheme process was developed by adapting and applying the approach of the Guide to Community Preventive Services (The Community Guide) (https://www.thecommunityguide.orgexternal icon). Additional information about the NPI rating scheme process is available (supplementary Appendices 3 and 4 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44314).The selected articles were organized into three groups: 1) personal NPIs (personal protective measures for everyday use and personal protective measures reserved for influenza pandemics); 2) community NPIs (social distancing measures and school closures and dismissals); and 3) environmental NPIs (surface cleaning measures) ( Table 8). Key steps included selecting the relevant literature, abstracting and synthesizing the evidence, and assessing the evidence quality (both individual study quality and quality of the body of evidence). A recommendation was formulated based on the evidence of effectiveness for each NPI. The strength of NPI recommendations took into consideration the effectiveness of the intervention, the ease of implementation (including unwanted consequences), and the importance of the intervention as a public health strategy. Additional information about the NPI evidence base is available (supplementary Chapter 3 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313 and supplementary Appendix 5 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44314).TopNPIs routinely recommended for prevention of respiratory virus transmission, such as seasonal influenza, include personal protective measures for everyday use (i.e., voluntary home isolation of ill persons, respiratory etiquette, and hand hygiene) and environmental surface cleaning measures (i.e., routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces and objects). During an influenza pandemic, these NPIs are recommended regardless of the pandemic severity level. Additional personal and community NPIs also might be recommended. Personal protective measures reserved for pandemics include voluntary home quarantine of exposed household members and use of face masks in community settings when ill. Community NPIs might include temporary closures or dismissals of child care facilities and schools with students in grades kindergarten through 12 (K\u201312), as well as other social distancing measures that increase the physical space between people (e.g., workplace measures such as replacing in-person meetings with teleconferences or modifying, postponing, or cancelling mass gatherings) ( Figure 5) (Table 1). Local decisions about NPI selection and timing involve consideration of overall pandemic severity and local conditions (1) and require flexibility and possible modifications as the pandemic progresses and new information becomes available.Updated recommendations on the use of NPIs to help slow the spread and decrease the impact of an influenza pandemic are provided, as is information on the rationale for using each NPI as part of a comprehensive public health strategy for pandemic response and the appropriate settings and use for each NPI according to the severity of the pandemic ( Table 9).\u00b6 The recommendations that follow are considered an update to the existing recommendations in the 2007 guidance because the same set of NPIs has been maintained and recommended for use early in a pandemic. However, the difference between the guidance issued in 2007 and in 2017 is the clear delineation of NPIs into two categories: 1) NPIs recommended at all times and 2) NPIs recommended for use only during pandemics (based on the level of pandemic severity and local conditions). The 2017 update also provides additional evidence to support the NPI recommendations.NPIs that can be implemented by individual persons include the following:Personal protective measures for everyday use: These include voluntary home isolation of ill persons, respiratory etiquette, and hand hygiene.Personal protective measures reserved for pandemics: These include voluntary home quarantine of exposed household members and use of face masks in community settings when ill.Personal protective measures are preventive actions that can be used daily to slow the spread of respiratory viruses (https://www.cdc.gov/nonpharmaceutical-interventions/personal/index.html; supplementary Chapter 3 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313). These measures include the following:Voluntary home isolation (i.e., staying home when ill or self-isolation): Persons with influenza stay home for at least 24 hours after a fever or signs of a fever (chills, sweating, and feeling warm or flushed)** are gone (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/preventing.htm), except to obtain medical care or other necessities.\u2020\u2020 To ensure that the fever is gone, patients\u2019 temperature should be measured in the absence of medication that lowers fever (e.g., acetaminophen or ibuprofen). In addition to fever, common influenza symptoms include cough or chest discomfort, muscle or body aches, headache, and fatigue. Persons also might experience sneezing, a runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, vomiting, and diarrhea (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/consumer/symptoms.htm).Respiratory etiquette: Persons cover coughs and sneezes, preferably with a tissue, and then dispose of tissues and disinfect hands immediately after a cough or sneeze, or (if a tissue is not available) cough or sneeze into a shirt sleeve. Touching the eyes, nose, and mouth should be avoided to help slow the spread of germs (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/covercough.htm).Hand hygiene: Persons perform regular and thorough hand washing with soap and water (or use alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% ethanol or isopropanol when soap and water are not available).Rationale for use as a public health strategy. Most persons infected with an influenza virus might become infectious 1 day before the onset of symptoms and remain infectious up to 5\u20137 days after becoming ill (54,55). However, studies found that infants and immunocompromised persons might shed influenza viruses for prolonged periods (up to 21 days and a mean of 19 days, respectively) (56,57). The effectiveness of personal protective measures depends on their ability to interrupt virus transmission from one person to another. Voluntary home isolation, which is a form of patient isolation, prevents an ill person from infecting other people outside of their household.\u00a7\u00a7 Respiratory etiquette reduces the dispersion of droplets contaminated with influenza virus being propelled through the air by coughing or sneezing. Hand hygiene reduces the transmission of influenza viruses that occurs when one person touches another (e.g., with a contaminated hand). Contamination also can occur through self-inoculation via fomite transmission (indirect contact transmission) when persons touch a contaminated surface and then touch their nose with a contaminated hand. A study conducted in households in Bangkok, Thailand, found that increased handwashing reduced surface contamination with influenza virus, which lowered the potential for self-inoculation via fomite transmission (58). Additional studies found that influenza viruses can remain viable on the human hand for roughly 3\u20135 minutes (59) and that influenza viruses can remain on fingers for 30 minutes after contamination (60).Settings and use. Voluntary home isolation involves persons remaining at home when ill with influenza. Respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene are recommended in homes and in all other community settings, including schools and workplaces. All three personal protective measures are considered everyday preventive actions that should be implemented year-round but that are especially important during annual influenza seasons and influenza pandemics ( Table 10). Use of these personal protective measures might result in some secondary (unintended or unwanted) consequences (e.g., concerns about job security for ill persons who lack paid sick leave or skin irritations due to frequent hand washing).Voluntary home isolation: CDC recommends voluntary home isolation of ill persons (staying home when ill) year-round and especially during annual influenza seasons and influenza pandemics.Respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene: CDC recommends respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene in all community settings, including homes, child care facilities, schools, workplaces, and other places where people gather, year-round and especially during annual influenza seasons and influenza pandemics.Voluntary home isolation, respiratory etiquette, and hand hygiene are recommended during both annual influenza seasons and influenza pandemics. Additional personal protective measures that might be recommended during pandemics include voluntary home quarantine of exposed household members and the use of face masks in community settings when ill. These measures might contribute to reductions in transmission of pandemic influenza viruses when the level of pandemic severity and local conditions warrant their use (supplementary Chapter 3 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313).Voluntary home quarantine of non-ill household members of persons with influenza (also called self-quarantine or household quarantine) helps prevent disease spread from households to schools, workplaces, and other households because those household members have been exposed to the influenza virus. Exposed household members of symptomatic persons (with confirmed or probable pandemic influenza) should stay home for up to 3 days (the estimated incubation period for seasonal influenza) (61) starting from their initial contact with the ill person. If they then become ill, they should practice voluntary home isolation (i.e., they should remain at home until recovered as discussed previously; https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/index.html). For certain exposed household members (e.g., those at high risk for influenza complications or with severe immune deficiencies), guidelines should be consulted regarding the prophylactic use of antiviral medications (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/index.htm).Rationale for use as a public health strategy. Voluntary home quarantine might help slow a pandemic by reducing community transmission from households with a person who has influenza because the exposed household members are at increased risk for infection. Furthermore, certain infected (but not yet symptomatic) household members could begin shedding influenza virus at least a day before exhibiting symptoms and could infect friends, neighbors, and others in the community (e.g., at school or work) before becoming symptomatic. Therefore, all members of a household with a symptomatic person (with confirmed or probable pandemic influenza) might be asked to stay home for a specified period of time (up to 3 days) to assess for early signs and symptoms of pandemic influenza virus infection. If other household members become ill during this period, then the time for voluntary home quarantine might need to be extended for another incubation period. The evidence for voluntary home quarantine, particularly when used in combination with other NPIs, includes a systematic literature review, historical analyses of the 1918 pandemic, and mathematical modeling studies (supplementary Chapter 3 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313 and supplementary Appendix 5 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44314).Settings and use. Voluntary home quarantine of exposed household members might be recommended during severe, very severe, or extreme influenza pandemics (Table 10) to help reduce the chance of transmitting the virus to others outside of the household. Advance planning is needed to minimize potential secondary consequences for persons who have special cultural, economic, legal, mental, physical, or social status needs (e.g., older adults who depend on necessary community-based services such as home-delivered meals and transportation to health care services). Other secondary consequences might include missed work and loss of income for persons whose employers do not have paid sick leave policies that include home quarantine during pandemics.Voluntary home quarantine: CDC might recommend voluntary home quarantine of exposed household members as a personal protective measure during severe, very severe, or extreme influenza pandemics in combination with other personal protective measures such as respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene. If a member of the household is symptomatic with confirmed or probable pandemic influenza, then all members of the household should stay home for up to 3 days (the estimated incubation period for seasonal influenza),\u00b6\u00b6 starting from their initial contact with the ill person, to monitor for influenza symptoms.Face masks (disposable surgical, medical, or dental procedure masks) are widely used by health care workers to prevent respiratory infections both in health care workers and patients. They also might be worn by ill persons during severe, very severe, or extreme pandemics to prevent spread of influenza to household members and others in the community. However, little evidence supports the use of face masks by well persons in community settings, although some trials conducted during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic found that early combined use of face masks and other NPIs (such as hand hygiene) might be effective (supplementary Chapter 3 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313).Rationale for use as a public health strategy. Face masks provide a physical barrier that prevents the transmission of influenza viruses from an ill person to a well person by blocking large-particle respiratory droplets propelled by coughing or sneezing. Face mask use by well persons is not routinely needed in most situations to prevent acquiring the influenza virus. However, use of face masks by well persons might be beneficial in certain situations (e.g., when persons at high risk for influenza complications cannot avoid crowded settings or parents are caring for ill children at home). Face mask use by well persons also might reduce self-inoculation (e.g., touching the nose with the hand after touching a contaminated surface).Settings and use. Disposable surgical, medical, and dental procedure masks are used widely in health care settings to prevent exposure to respiratory infections. Face masks have few secondary consequences (e.g., discomfort or difficulty breathing) when worn properly and consistently, and face masks sized for children are available. (Additional information about face masks is available at https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/productsandmedicalprocedures/generalhospitaldevicesandsupplies/personalprotectiveequipment/ucm055977.htmexternal icon and https://www.osha.gov/Publications/respirators-vs-surgicalmasks-factsheet.htmlexternal icon.)Use of face masks by ill persons: CDC might recommend the use of face masks by ill persons as a source control measure during severe, very severe, or extreme influenza pandemics when crowded community settings cannot be avoided (e.g., when adults and children with influenza symptoms seek medical attention) or when ill persons are in close contact with others (e.g., when symptomatic persons share common spaces with other household members or symptomatic postpartum women care for and nurse their infants). Some evidence indicates that face mask use by ill persons might protect others from infection.Use of face masks by well persons: CDC does not routinely recommend the use of face masks by well persons in the home or other community settings as a means of avoiding infection during influenza pandemics except under special, high-risk circumstances (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/infectioncontrol/maskguidance.htm). For example, during a severe pandemic, pregnant women and other persons at high risk for influenza complications might use face masks if unable to avoid crowded settings, especially if no pandemic vaccine is available. In addition, persons caring for ill family members at home (e.g., a parent of a child exhibiting influenza symptoms) might use face masks to avoid infection when in close contact with a patient, just as health care personnel wear masks in health care settings.NPIs that can be implemented by communities include the following:School closures and dismissals: These include temporary closures and dismissals of child care facilities, K\u201312 schools, and institutions of higher education.Social distancing measures: These include measures for schools, workplaces, and mass gatherings.In the event of a pandemic, state and local public health authorities play an important role in protecting the school community and should establish and maintain partnerships with district and school leaders, school emergency operations planning teams, and local municipality leaders (e.g., mayors). Public health authorities are a credible source of information, have multiple (often free) resources available for information awareness campaigns, and provide guidance for increasing school response measures. Depending on the severity of the pandemic, these measures might range from everyday preventive actions to preemptive, coordinated school closures and dismissals. A school closure means closing a school and sending all the students and staff members home, whereas during a school dismissal, a school might stay open for staff members while the children stay home. Preemptive school dismissals can be used to disrupt transmission of influenza before many students and staff members become ill. Coordinated dismissals refer to the simultaneous or sequential closing of schools in a jurisdiction. Thus, preemptive, coordinated school closures and dismissals can be used early during an influenza pandemic to prevent virus transmission in schools and surrounding communities by reducing close contact among the following groups (supplementary Chapter 3 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313):Children in child care centers and preschoolsSchool-aged children and teens in K\u201312 schoolsYoung adults in institutions of higher educationDuring a dismissal, the school facilities are kept open, which allows teachers to develop and deliver lessons and materials, thus maintaining continuity of teaching and learning, and allows other staff members to continue to provide services and help with additional response efforts. School closures and dismissals might be coupled with social distancing measures (e.g., cancelling sporting events and other mass gatherings) to reduce out-of-school social contact among children when schools are closed.Rationale for use as a public health strategy. Preventing the spread of disease in educational settings among children and young adults reduces the risk for infection for these age groups and slows virus transmission in the community. Components of the strategy might include preemptive, coordinated school closures and dismissals implemented during the earliest stages of a pandemic, before many students and staff members become ill. Preemptive, coordinated dismissals can be implemented by the following facilities for the following reasons:Child care facilities and K\u201312 schoolsChildren have higher influenza attack rates than adults (62) and are infectious for a longer period than adults (63,64).Influenza transmission is common in schools and contributes to school absenteeism and parental absenteeism from work (65,66).The presence of school-aged children in a household is a risk factor for influenza virus infection in families (62,65,67).Social contact and mixing patterns among school-aged children differ substantially depending on the grade and school level, during various periods of the school day, between weekdays and weekends, and between regular school terms and holiday breaks (68\u201371). Physical floor plans and intergrade activities (e.g., cafeteria size and lunch breaks) also can affect in-school social mixing (68).Schoolchildren can introduce the influenza virus into a community, leading to increased rates of illness among their household or community contacts (72\u201374).Institutions of higher educationInfluenza outbreaks on college and university campuses typically have high attack rates (44%\u201373%) (75\u201378) and cause substantial morbidity (79,80). For example, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, influenza spread rapidly through a university campus within 2 weeks (81); on another residential campus, one infected freshman initiated an outbreak that resulted in 226 laboratory-confirmed cases. Freshmen were the main facilitators of the spread of the H1N1pdm09 virus because of their higher number and frequency of social contacts (82).Influenza is more prevalent among residential students at boarding schools and colleges than among nonresidential students (78,83).ILIs are common among college and university students and are associated with increased health care use, decreased health status, and impaired school performance (84).Implementation of preemptive, coordinated school closures and dismissals during an evolving influenza pandemic might have one or more of the following three public health objectives***:Objective 1: To gain time for an initial assessment of transmissibility and clinical severity of the pandemic virus in the very early stage of its circulation in humans (closures for up to 2 weeks)Objective 2: To slow down the spread of the pandemic virus in areas that are beginning to experience local outbreaks and thereby allow time for the local health care system to prepare additional resources for responding to increased demand for health care services (closures up to 6 weeks)Objective 3: To allow time for pandemic vaccine production and distribution (closures up to 6 months)Two other types of school closures and dismissals might be implemented during a pandemic for public health or institutional reasons. These interventions do not slow disease spread in the community; therefore, they are not considered NPIs. They include the following:Selective school closures and dismissals: These might be implemented by schools that serve students at high risk for complications from infection with influenza,\u2020\u2020\u2020 especially when transmission rates are high. For example, a school that serves children with certain medical conditions or pregnant teens might decide to close while other schools in the area remain open. In addition, some communities or early childhood programs might consider closing child care facilities to help decrease the spread of influenza among children aged <5 years. Selective dismissals are intended to protect persons at high risk for influenza rather than to help reduce virus transmission within the community.Reactive school closures and dismissals: These might be implemented when many students and staff members are ill and not attending school or when many students and staff members are arriving at school ill and being sent home. For example, a child care center might close because it is unable to operate under these conditions. Reactive dismissals, which might occur during outbreaks of seasonal influenza (85) and during pandemics (15), are unlikely to affect virus transmission because they typically take place after considerable, if not widespread, transmission has already occurred in the community. For example, a 4-day reactive closure in a western Kentucky school district did not reduce ILI transmission in the rural community (86). Similarly, closing 559 Michigan schools at least once during the fall wave (i.e., second wave) of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic had little effect on community levels of ILI (87).For more information about preparing for influenza and the different types of dismissals, see CDC websites regarding 1) child care facilities (https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/childcare/toolkit/pdf/childcare_toolkit.pdfpdf icon), 2) K\u201312 schools (https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/schools/toolkit/pdf/schoolflutoolkit.pdfpdf icon), and 3) institutions of higher education (https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/institutions/toolkit/pdf/IHE_toolkit.pdfpdf icon).Settings and use. Preemptive, coordinated school closures and dismissals might be implemented at child care facilities, K\u201312 schools, and institutions of higher education. They are most likely to be implemented when an influenza pandemic is severe, very severe, or extreme (Table 10). Secondary consequences include missed work and loss of income for parents who stay home from work to care for their children and missed opportunities to vaccinate school-aged children rapidly unless other mechanisms are considered.School closures and dismissals: CDC might recommend the use of preemptive, coordinated school closures and dismissals during severe, very severe, or extreme influenza pandemics. This recommendation is in accord with the conclusions of the U.S. Community Preventive Services Task Force (https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/emergency-preparedness-and-response-school-dismissals-reduce-transmission-pandemic-influenzaexternal icon), which makes the following recommendations:The task force recommends preemptive, coordinated school dismissals during a severe influenza pandemic.The task force found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against preemptive, coordinated school dismissals during a mild or moderate influenza pandemic. In these instances, jurisdictions should make decisions that balance local benefits and potential harms.Social distancing measures can reduce virus transmission by decreasing the frequency and duration of social contact among persons of all ages. These measures are common-sense approaches to limiting face-to-face contact, which reduces person-to-person transmission.Rationale for use as a public health strategy. Social distancing measures that reduce opportunities for person-to-person virus transmission can help delay the spread and slow the exponential growth of a pandemic. The optimal strategy is to implement these measures simultaneously in places where persons gather. Although direct evidence is limited for the effectiveness of these measures, components of the strategy might include reducing social contacts at the following places:Schools: Children have higher influenza attack rates than adults, and influenza transmission is common in schools.Workplaces: More than half of all U.S. adults participate in the U.S workforce,\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 and workers often share office space and equipment and have frequent face-to-face contact. Influenza attack rates in working-age adults (aged 18\u201364 years) might be as high as 15.5% during a single influenza season (88).Mass gatherings: Group events such as concerts, festivals, and sporting events bring people into close contact for extended periods (89\u201392). A systematic literature review of respiratory disease outbreaks related to mass gatherings in the United States during 2005\u20132014 indicated that 40 of 72 different outbreaks were associated with state or county agriculture fairs and (zoonotic) transmission of influenza A H3N2v, and 25 outbreaks were associated with residential youth summer camps and person-to-person transmission of influenza A H1N1 (93). An infected traveler attending a mass gathering might introduce influenza to a previously unaffected area, and a person who becomes infected at the event can further spread the infection after returning home (89,90,92,94\u201396). Even when a circulating virus has a relatively low basic reproductive rate (R0), intensely crowded settings might lead to high secondary attack rates (92). For example, during the 2013 Hajj (Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca) in Saudi Arabia, influenza A/H1N1 virus was found in only two Indonesians on arrival but spread to 25 persons from Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia after the Hajj because of the extremely crowded conditions when performing rituals (97).Multiple social distancing measures can be implemented simultaneously. Although there is limited empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of implementing any individual measure alone (other than school closures and dismissals), the evidence for implementing multiple social distancing measures in combination with other NPIs includes systematic literature reviews, historical analyses of the 1918 pandemic, and mathematical modeling studies (supplementary Chapter 3 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313 and supplementary Appendix 5 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44314).Settings and use. Social distancing measures can be implemented in a range of community settings, including educational facilities, workplaces, and public places where people gather (e.g., parks, religious institutions, theaters, and sports arenas). The choice of social distancing measure depends on the severity of the pandemic (Table 10). Certain measures might be implemented with few secondary consequences (e.g., increased use of e-mail and teleconferences in some workplaces), whereas others might require advance planning (e.g., modification of mass gatherings). Examples of practical measures that might reduce face-to-face contact in community settings include the following:If schools remain open during a pandemic, divide school classes into smaller groups of students and rearrange desks so students are spaced at least 3 feet (98) from each other in a classroom.Offer telecommuting and replace in-person meetings in the workplace with video or telephone conferences.Modify, postpone, or cancel mass gatherings.Social distancing measures: Even though the evidence base for the effectiveness of some of these measures is limited, CDC might recommend the simultaneous use of multiple social distancing measures to help reduce the spread of influenza in community settings (e.g., schools, workplaces, and mass gatherings) during severe, very severe, or extreme influenza pandemics while minimizing the secondary consequences of the measures. Social distancing measures include the following:Increasing the distance to at least 3 feet (98) between persons when possible might reduce person-to person transmission. This applies to apparently healthy persons without symptoms. In the event of a very severe or extreme pandemic, this recommended minimal distance between people might be increased.Persons in community settings who show symptoms consistent with influenza and who might be infected with (probable) pandemic influenza should be separated from well persons as soon as practical, be sent home, and practice voluntary home isolation.Environmental surface cleaning measures can help eliminate influenza viruses from frequently touched surfaces and objects, including tables, door knobs, toys, desks, and computer keyboards. These measures involve cleaning surfaces with detergent-based cleaners or disinfectants that have been registered with the Environmental Protection Agency.\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6Rationale for use as a public health strategy. Although the percentage of influenza cases involving contact transmission (i.e., hand transfer of virus from contaminated objects to the eyes, nose, or mouth) is unknown, this mode of transmission is a recognized route of virus spread (99). The routine use of cleaning measures that eliminate viruses from contaminated surfaces might reduce the spread of influenza viruses (supplementary Chapter 3 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313).Settings and use. Environmental surface cleaning measures are recommended for frequently touched surfaces and objects in homes, child care facilities, schools, workplaces, and other places where persons gather. These measures can be used for prevention of seasonal influenza and in all pandemic severity scenarios (Table 10). Use of these measures might result in some secondary consequences (e.g., failing to read instruction labels before applying disinfectants to ensure that they are safe and appropriate to use or cleaning with poor ventilation during the application process).Environmental surface cleaning measures: CDC recommends environmental surface cleaning measures in all settings, including homes, schools, and workplaces, to remove influenza viruses from frequently touched surfaces and objects. Use of these measures might help prevent transmission of various infectious agents, including seasonal and pandemic influenza (https://www.cdc.gov/nonpharmaceutical-interventions/environmental/index.html; https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/questions/cleaning-disinfecting-environmental-surfaces.html).Additional guidance is available from CDC for health care facilities (https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/eic_in_HCF_03.pdfpdf icon), schools (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/school/cleaning.htm), and airline, travel, and transportation industries (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/archived/transportation-planning.html).TopThis report expands the NPI guidance presented in the 2007 report by providing evidence-based recommendations on the use of the same set of NPIs. These NPIs include personal protective measures for everyday use and for use during a pandemic, community measures (school closures and dismissals and social distancing), and environmental surface cleaning measures.The rationale for and key concepts regarding the use of NPIs during influenza pandemics first presented in the 2007 guidance remain unchanged. Because production of a pandemic vaccine can take up to 6 months and antiviral medications might be prioritized for treatment, NPIs are likely to be the only prevention tools available early in a pandemic. Therefore, they are critical to slowing the spread of the pandemic influenza virus while a pandemic vaccine is under development.Like the 2007 strategy, this 2017 update affirms the importance of prepandemic planning and preparedness for use of NPIs during a pandemic response and recommends the early, targeted, and simultaneous implementation of multiple NPIs to decrease influenza virus transmission. Although community-level NPIs can help slow virus transmission, as supported by historical information (100), empirical observations (101), and mathematical modeling (102), these measures are likely to cause unwanted consequences by introducing new norms for social behavior (e.g., adopting precautionary health-protective behaviors such as limiting face-to-face contact with family and friends, only shopping for essential items, avoiding places where people congregate, or not using public transportation) (103), interrupting routine societal functions, and entailing additional costs. If an evolving influenza pandemic is characterized by high clinical severity, the benefits of deploying NPIs, including those with greater potential for secondary consequences, are likely to outweigh potential harms. The more difficult decision is determining how and when to implement the community-level NPIs that are more disruptive to society (e.g., temporary K\u201312 school closures) during pandemics of moderate severity. In each locality, the goal should be to implement NPIs early enough and long enough to maximize effectiveness while minimizing economic and social costs to ensure that NPIs are commensurate to the pandemic severity.New elements in this report, in addition to the evidence-based NPI recommendations, include a summary of key lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response (Box 1), information on community engagement and preparedness (supplementary Chapter 1 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313), and information on new or updated pandemic assessment tools (supplementary Chapter 2 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313), which include the novel influenza virus pandemic intervals tool, the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool, and PSAF. As described in the following sections, this report also presents two additional planning tools designed to assist states and localities in ensuring pandemic preparedness.During the initial stages of a pandemic, CDC will use the PSAF tool to prepare an initial assessment of pandemic severity that provides early guidance on use of NPIs to help slow the transmission of the novel virus. To facilitate the use of the initial assessment information by state and local health departments, CDC has provided a set of four prepandemic planning scenarios. Each scenario aligns with one of the four assessment quadrants (Figure 3) and provides information on past influenza pandemics for comparison (Table 9). These planning scenarios are designed to facilitate state and local prepandemic planning for NPI implementation according to pandemic severity (as classified by PSAF) ( Figure 6) (Tables 9 and 10). After sufficient epidemiologic data are accrued and the refined assessment of pandemic severity becomes available, CDC will issue updated pandemic NPI guidance, which will be tailored more precisely to the specific pandemic. Additional information about the planning scenarios and phasing of NPIs is available (supplementary Chapter 2 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313).The 2007 report included supplemental prepandemic NPI planning guides for individuals and families; child care programs, K\u201312 schools, and institutions of higher education; community- and faith-based organizations; and businesses and other workplaces. These guides have been updated, and two new guides have been developed for public health communicators and event planners that address NPI communications and modification, postponement, or cancellation of mass gatherings. These guides are intended to help operationalize the 2017 update and provide specific information that can assist different groups in their prepandemic planning and decision-making (https://www.cdc.gov/nonpharmaceutical-interventions).Although progress has been made since 2009 toward building the evidence base for use of NPIs to slow the spread of pandemic influenza, additional research is needed. For personal NPIs, areas for additional research include evaluating the effects of increased frequency and quality of hand washing on influenza virus transmission, determining the role of infected persons who are not symptomatic in the transmission of influenza viruses in households, and assessing the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of recommending face mask use by well persons in community settings as a means of avoiding infection during a pandemic. For community NPIs, one topic for additional study involves gathering empirical data on social mixing patterns in schools and community settings. These data can be used to create high-fidelity, high-resolution mathematical models of virus transmission in these settings to facilitate data-driven evaluations of different social distancing measures. Another area of research for community NPIs involves assessing the potential secondary consequences (e.g., missed work) of select community-level measures (e.g., school closures) for families, communities, and society to assess the economic effects of these measures. For environmental NPIs, additional research is needed to better understand surface contamination (e.g., which types of surfaces are more likely to be contaminated with influenza viruses) and identify situations in which surface cleaning should be emphasized (e.g., in households with confirmed influenza cases versus in healthy households). Additional information about NPI research gaps is available (supplementary Chapter 3 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313).TopThe 2009 H1N1 pandemic provided an opportunity to test, in practice, the key concepts of NPIs in mitigating the impact of an influenza pandemic, just 2 years after the publication of the 2007 guidance. As the experience from 2009 has shown, NPIs can be a critical component of pandemic influenza mitigation. Although well-matched pandemic vaccines remain the main tool in reducing the risk of acquiring infection and in controlling the spread of a pandemic virus, vaccines might not be widely available for up to 6 months after the emergence of a pandemic influenza virus, given current vaccine production technology. Furthermore, as during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, antiviral medications might be prioritized for treatment but not used for widespread chemoprophylaxis because of concerns about antiviral resistance and limited stockpiles of antiviral medications. Therefore, NPIs might be the only prevention tools readily available for persons and communities to help slow transmission of an influenza virus during the initial stages of a pandemic. However, individual NPIs might be only partially effective in limiting community transmission when implemented alone. Thus, the most efficient implementation involves early, targeted, and layered use of multiple NPIs (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/planning-preparedness/community-mitigation.html). In addition, some community-level NPIs that potentially have the greatest epidemiologic effects on pandemic influenza virus transmission in communities, most notably school closures and dismissals, also are most likely to be associated with secondary (unwanted) consequences (104). Hence, prepandemic planning, including engaging communities in planning activities well ahead of the next pandemic, is critical to enable appropriate local decision-making during the early stages of a pandemic.After the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, evidence on the effectiveness and feasibility of NPIs expanded substantially. A summary of the evidence in this 2017 update includes 2009 H1N1-related research (supplementary Appendix 5 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44314). However, knowledge gaps remain and should be addressed by future research. Further updates of these guidelines will be developed and issued when significant new information and evidence emerges about the effectiveness and feasibility of NPIs in mitigating the impact of pandemic influenza.TopAlexandra Levitt, PhD, Office of Infectious Diseases, CDC,; Stephanie Dopson, ScD, Influenza Coordination Unit, Office of Infectious Diseases, CDC; Mark Frank, MPH, Influenza Coordination Unit, Office of Infectious Diseases, CDC; Rachel Holloway, Influenza Coordination Unit, Office of Infectious Diseases, CDC; Lisa Koonin, DrPH, Influenza Coordination Unit, Office of Infectious Diseases, CDC; Sonja Rasmussen, MD, Influenza Coordination Unit, Office of Infectious Diseases, CDC; Stephen Redd, MD, Influenza Coordination Unit, Office of Infectious Diseases, CDC; Christopher  de la Motte Hurst, MPH, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC; Neha Kanade, MPH, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC; Noreen Qualls, DrPH, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC; Jeanette Rainey, PhD, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC; Amra Uzicanin, MD, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC; Matthew Biggerstaff, MPH, Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, CDC; Daniel Jernigan, MD, Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, CDC; Carrie Reed, DSc, Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, CDC.TopCoordination TeamAlexandra Levitt, PhD, Office of Infectious Diseases; Narue Wright-Jegede, MPH, Neha Kanade, MPH, and Noreen Qualls, DrPH, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC.Abstraction TeamYao-Hsuan Chen, PhD, Charissa Dowdye, MPH, Hongjiang Gao, PhD, Narue Wright-Jegede, MPH, Neha Kanade, MPH, Jasmine Kenney, MPH, Erin Keyes, MPH, Tiffani Phelps, MPH, Noreen Qualls, DrPH, Jeanette Rainey, PhD, Jianrong Shi, MD, Karen Wong, MD, and Yenlik Zheteyeva, MD, Community Interventions for Infection Control Unit, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC.Consultation TeamMaleeka Glover, ScD, Influenza Coordination Unit, Office of Infectious Diseases; Rita Helfand, MD, Office of the Director, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases; Clive Brown, FRSPH, Martin Cetron, MD, Pamela Diaz, MD, Katrin Kohl, MD, PhD, David McAdam, MPA, and Jessica Reichard, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases; Bryan Christensen, PhD, Carolyn Gould, MD, Jeff Hageman, MD, John Jernigan, MD, and David Kuhar, MD, Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases; William Potts-Datema, MS, and Mary Vernon-Smiley, MD, Division of Adolescent and School Health, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention; Belinda Smith and Teresa Smith, RN, Health Communication Science Office, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Carolyn Bridges, MD, and Samuel Graitcer, MD, Immunization Services Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Joseph Bresee, MD, Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Lisa Delaney, MD, and Chad Dowell, MD, Office of the Director, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; Samuel Groseclose, DVM, Laura Leidel, MSN, and Carol Pertowski, MD, Office of the Director, Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response; Steven Boedigheimer, MBA, Christa Singleton, MD, Theresa Smith, MD, and Todd Talbert, MA, Division of State and Local Readiness, Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response, CDC.TopThe CDC contributors wish to disclose that they have no financial or competing interests or other relationships that would unfairly influence these CDC guidelines and recommendations.TopCorresponding author: Noreen Qualls, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC.

Guidance and policies in these areas will be developed separately, as needed.\u2020 In July 2009, ACIP recommended vaccination of several population groups, including children aged 6 months through 18 years because cases of H1N1 influenza had occurred in children who were in close contact with each other in school and child care settings (https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/vaccination/acip.htm).\u00a7 The pandemic mitigation framework proposed in the 2007 strategy was based on the early, targeted, and layered use of multiple NPIs. NPIs should be initiated early in a pandemic before local epidemics grow exponentially, be targeted toward those at the nexus of transmission (in affected areas where the novel virus circulates), and be layered together to reduce community transmission as much as possible. A list of NPIs that are recommended at all times and those that are reserved for pandemics is provided (Table 1).\u00b6 Influenza pandemics can range from mild to extreme in terms of rates of viral transmission and clinical severity, as described in the four prepandemic planning scenarios developed by CDC. A very severe or extreme pandemic, such as the 1918 pandemic, is characterized by high to very high transmissibility and clinical severity. A severe pandemic, such as the pandemics of 1957 and 1968, is characterized by high transmissibility and low to medium clinical severity. A mild or moderate pandemic, such as the 2009 pandemic, is characterized by low to medium transmissibility and clinical severity.** Although many authorities use either 100\u00b0F or 100.4\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C) as indicative of fever, this number can vary depending on factors such as the method of measurement and the age of the person. Therefore, other values for fever could be appropriate. CDC has public health recommendations that are based on the presence (or absence) of fever (i.e., persons\u2019 temperature is not higher than their own normal temperature).\u2020\u2020 Guidance for caring for persons at home who have influenza symptoms is available at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/consumer/caring-for-someone.htm.\u00a7\u00a7 Additional information about isolation and quarantine is available at https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/QuarantineIsolation.html.\u00b6\u00b6 If the incubation period for the next pandemic were shorter or longer than 3 days, CDC would amend the recommendation accordingly.*** Additional information on the use of preemptive, coordinated school closures and dismissals of different durations is available (supplementary Chapter 3 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44313).\u2020\u2020\u2020 Persons at high risk for influenza-related complications include children aged <5 years (and especially aged <2 years), adults aged \u226565 years, pregnant women, residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, and American Indians/Alaska Natives. Those at high risk also include persons with asthma, neurological and neurodevelopmental conditions, chronic lung disease, and heart disease; disorders of the blood, endocrine system, kidney, or liver; metabolic disorders; and weakened immune systems from disease or medication. Two other groups at higher risk are persons aged <19 years who receive long-term aspirin therapy and those with extreme obesity (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/high_risk.htm).\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 As of September 2016, the U.S. workforce included 62.9% of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged \u226516 years (Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Pandemic influenza: emergency planning and community preparedness. 2008. Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press; 2008:158).TopAbbreviations: HHS = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; ILI = influenza-like illness; WHO = World Health Organization.TopThe 2009 H1N1 pandemic demonstrated the unpredictable nature of influenza viruses and showed that prepandemic planning must be broad and flexible. Lessons learned during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response from the United States and other affected countries follow.The epidemiology of pandemic influenza might be different from the epidemiology of seasonal influenza; therefore, different populations might be disproportionately affected.The 2007 Pandemic Severity Index had limited usefulness because attack rates and case-fatality ratios were difficult to measure and imprecise early in the pandemic.Well-established methods to prevent seasonal influenza transmission, such as hand hygiene promotion, also were effective in pandemic influenza settings to prevent the spread of H1N1pdm09 virus in some communities.Additional assessments are needed to determine the value of combining voluntary home quarantine with antiviral chemoprophylaxis.Most members of the public complied with public health recommendations regarding hand hygiene and social distancing.School-related NPIs, including school closures and dismissals, were acceptable and feasible.Public health practitioners should be prepared to explain that the initial pandemic guidance might change if a pandemic is more or less severe than initially assessed.Public engagement, community preparedness, and trust in government action are important for successful NPI implementation during a pandemic.TopBefore initiating a community engagement effort, consider the following:1. Be clear about the purpose or goals of the engagement effort and the relevant populations and communities.2. Become knowledgeable about the community\u2019s culture, economic conditions, social networks, political and power structures, norms and values, demographic trends, history, and experience with efforts by outside groups to engage it in various programs. Learn about the community\u2019s perceptions of those initiating the engagement activities.For engagement to occur, the following steps are necessary:3. Go to the community, establish relationships, build trust, work with the formal and informal leaders, and seek commitment from community organizations and leaders to create processes for mobilizing the community.4. Remember and accept that collective self-determination is the responsibility and right of all people in a community. No external entity should assume the ability to bestow on a community the power to act in its own self-interest.For engagement to succeed, consider the following:5. Partnering with the community is necessary to create change and improve health.6. All aspects of community engagement must recognize and respect the diversity of the community. Awareness of the various cultures of a community and other factors affecting diversity must be paramount in planning, designing, and implementing approaches to engaging a community.7. Community engagement can only be sustained by identifying and mobilizing community assets and strengths and by developing the community\u2019s capacity and resources to make decisions and take action.8. Organizations that would like to involve a community and those seeking to effect change must be prepared to release control of actions or interventions to the community and be flexible enough to meet changing needs.9. Community collaboration requires long-term commitment by the engaging organizations and its partners.Source: Adapted from: Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.

These studies contribute to the overall body of literature on NPIs and help support the evidence base on the effectiveness of NPIs.

Selective dismissals might be implemented by schools that serve students at high risk for complications from infection with influenza.

Selective and reactive dismissals do not help slow disease transmission in the community.\n**Social distancing measures that reduce face-to-face contact in schools might include dividing classes into smaller groups of students who are spaced further apart from each other within the classroom.\n\u2020\u2020Social distancing measures that reduce face-to-face contact in workplaces might include offering telework and remote meeting options. Flexible sick leave policies should be implemented to encourage workers to stay home if needed.\n\u00a7\u00a7In all scenarios, mass gathering attendance during local outbreaks should be discouraged for persons at high risk for severe influenza-related complications.TopSource: Adapted from: Reed C, Biggerstaff M, Finelli L, et al.

            "main_text": "Disease outbreak news\n22 February 2020On 7 February 2020, the Chile IHR National Focal Point informed the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) of the detection of three confirmed cases of autochthonous dengue fever reported on Easter Island. The cases were diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on 6 February and microbiological characterization identified the cases as serotype 2 (DENV 2 by PCR). Laboratory confirmation was performed at the national reference laboratory of the Chile Institute of Public Health on 6 February 2020.These are the first confirmed cases of dengue due to DENV 2 reported on Easter Island in 2020. The cases are females with ages ranging from 27 to 49 years. The dates of symptom onset were between 27 January to 6 February 2020. None of the cases reported any travel history.In 2000, the presence of the vector, A. aegypti, was confirmed on Easter Island. The first dengue outbreak was reported in 2002 and was due to DENV 1. In 2009, two autochthonous DENV 4 cases were detected and in 2016, 2017 and 2018, cases due to DENV 1 were reported (33, 2 and 18 cases, respectively). In 2019, a total of 38 dengue cases were reported on Easter Island (28 autochthonous DENV 1 cases, nine imported cases from Tahiti (four DENV 1 and five DENV 2 cases), and one probable autochthonous DENV 1 case). No severe dengue cases were reported in 2019.Since 2009, no other serotypes besides DENV 1 have been identified in autochthonous cases until the beginning of 2020.The density of competent vectors on Easter Island could potentially contribute to the spread of the disease throughout the island.Actions implemented by local public health authorities are as follows:Dengue fever is a febrile illness that affects infants, young children, and adults, with symptoms ranging from mild fever to high fever, with headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and rash. It is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected with one of the four dengue virus serotypes.The introduction of serotype DENV 2 into this population, majority of which already have primary infection with DENV 1, can pose a potential risk for severe dengue cases due to secondary infections.Easter Island has a subtropical climate. The average annual temperature is 20.5\u00b0C with small variations between seasons that do not usually exceed 7\u00b0C.  Summer runs from 21 December to 21 March, with January and February being the warmest months with an average maximum temperature of 28\u00b0C and minimum temperature of 15\u00b0C.Easter Island has weekly air transport connections with French Polynesia, where there is an ongoing dengue outbreak with predominantly DENV 2. Additionally, due to the presence of the competent vector and, given that Easter Island is a popular tourist destination, the risk of spread to neighboring islands and countries cannot be ruled out.In light of the increase in dengue cases and possible severe dengue cases in several countries and territories of the Region of the Americas especially in 2019, PAHO/WHO encourages Member States to follow the key recommendations regarding outbreak preparedness and response, case management, laboratory, and integrated vector management (IVM) as published in the 21 November 2018 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Alert on Dengue and the 11 November 2019 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on Dengue.There is no specific treatment for dengue; however, the timely detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue, and appropriate case management are key elements of care to prevent patient deaths due to dengue. A delay in seeking medical care in severe dengue cases is often related to deaths from dengue virus disease.Additionally, IVM activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure. This should include both larval and adult vector control strategies (i.e. environmental management and source reduction and chemical control measures). Vector control measures should be implemented at households, places of work, schools, and healthcare facilities, among others, to prevent the vector-person contact.Given that Aedes mosquitoes, the competent vector, have greater activity during the day, personal protection measures are recommended such as the use of protective clothing that minimizes skin exposure and repellents that can be applied to exposed skin or clothes; the use of repellents must be in strict accordance with the label instructions. Window and door screens, and mosquito nets (impregnated or not with insecticide), can be useful to reduce the vector-person contact in closed spaces during the day or night. Community supported source reduction measures should be initiated, and vector surveillance and control implemented.For more information, please see the following links:",

            "main_text": "Disease outbreak news\n22 February 2020On 7 February 2020, the Chile IHR National Focal Point informed the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) of the detection of three confirmed cases of autochthonous dengue fever reported on Easter Island. The cases were diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on 6 February and microbiological characterization identified the cases as serotype 2 (DENV 2 by PCR). Laboratory confirmation was performed at the national reference laboratory of the Chile Institute of Public Health on 6 February 2020.These are the first confirmed cases of dengue due to DENV 2 reported on Easter Island in 2020. The cases are females with ages ranging from 27 to 49 years. The dates of symptom onset were between 27 January to 6 February 2020. None of the cases reported any travel history.In 2000, the presence of the vector, A. aegypti, was confirmed on Easter Island. The first dengue outbreak was reported in 2002 and was due to DENV 1. In 2009, two autochthonous DENV 4 cases were detected and in 2016, 2017 and 2018, cases due to DENV 1 were reported (33, 2 and 18 cases, respectively). In 2019, a total of 38 dengue cases were reported on Easter Island (28 autochthonous DENV 1 cases, nine imported cases from Tahiti (four DENV 1 and five DENV 2 cases), and one probable autochthonous DENV 1 case). No severe dengue cases were reported in 2019.Since 2009, no other serotypes besides DENV 1 have been identified in autochthonous cases until the beginning of 2020.The density of competent vectors on Easter Island could potentially contribute to the spread of the disease throughout the island.Actions implemented by local public health authorities are as follows:Dengue fever is a febrile illness that affects infants, young children, and adults, with symptoms ranging from mild fever to high fever, with headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and rash. It is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected with one of the four dengue virus serotypes.The introduction of serotype DENV 2 into this population, majority of which already have primary infection with DENV 1, can pose a potential risk for severe dengue cases due to secondary infections.Easter Island has a subtropical climate. The average annual temperature is 20.5\u00b0C with small variations between seasons that do not usually exceed 7\u00b0C.  Summer runs from 21 December to 21 March, with January and February being the warmest months with an average maximum temperature of 28\u00b0C and minimum temperature of 15\u00b0C.Easter Island has weekly air transport connections with French Polynesia, where there is an ongoing dengue outbreak with predominantly DENV 2. Additionally, due to the presence of the competent vector and, given that Easter Island is a popular tourist destination, the risk of spread to neighboring islands and countries cannot be ruled out.In light of the increase in dengue cases and possible severe dengue cases in several countries and territories of the Region of the Americas especially in 2019, PAHO/WHO encourages Member States to follow the key recommendations regarding outbreak preparedness and response, case management, laboratory, and integrated vector management (IVM) as published in the 21 November 2018 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Alert on Dengue and the 11 November 2019 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on Dengue.There is no specific treatment for dengue; however, the timely detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue, and appropriate case management are key elements of care to prevent patient deaths due to dengue. A delay in seeking medical care in severe dengue cases is often related to deaths from dengue virus disease.Additionally, IVM activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure. This should include both larval and adult vector control strategies (i.e. environmental management and source reduction and chemical control measures). Vector control measures should be implemented at households, places of work, schools, and healthcare facilities, among others, to prevent the vector-person contact.Given that Aedes mosquitoes, the competent vector, have greater activity during the day, personal protection measures are recommended such as the use of protective clothing that minimizes skin exposure and repellents that can be applied to exposed skin or clothes; the use of repellents must be in strict accordance with the label instructions. Window and door screens, and mosquito nets (impregnated or not with insecticide), can be useful to reduce the vector-person contact in closed spaces during the day or night. Community supported source reduction measures should be initiated, and vector surveillance and control implemented.For more information, please see the following links:",

Infectious disease physicians say the rapid spread of coronavirus cases outside China could signal a game changer in the response to the global outbreak.\"Globally, we will not be able to contain the spread of this virus. We can slow it down, but we can't stop it,\" said Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital who worked on the front lines of the SARS epidemic in 2003.\"The number of countries with cases is going to continue to increase.\"Officials are\u00a0also concerned about the number of cases with \"no clear epidemiological link,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Friday, such as travel history to China or contact with a known confirmed case.He said while the number of cases outside China remains small, they are \"worrisome.\"\"It's in our hands now,\" Tedros said. \"If we do well within the narrowing window of opportunity, we can avert any serious crisis. If we squander the opportunity, then there will be a serious problem on our hands.\"Canada's ninth presumptive case of coronavirus is a woman in her 30s who recently travelled to Iran and is now recovering at home in British Columbia.Health officials were surprised to learn she had not travelled to China or any of its neighbouring countries, and have classified the case as a \"sentinel event\" \u2014 one that originated from a region that is completely unexpected.Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, said they are investigating where the woman\u00a0may have contracted the virus, working alongside the Public Health Agency of Canada. The woman had a travelling companion, was visiting family and is now in isolation at home.\"Until very recently, we didn't consider Iran as a place of transmission of COVID-19,\" Henry said in an interview. \"So that set off quite a number of warning bells for us.\"Henry said the investigation continues into where the woman travelled, but she\u00a0hadn't been to the city of\u00a0Qom, where a handful of cases have been recorded. \"She did report at the airport [in Tehran] that there were quite a lot of people who were sick and who were wearing masks,\" she said.The answers are important to public health measures aimed at containing the virus, such as whether Canada should expand its border-screening questionnaires for travellers from places beyond the epicentre in China's Hubei province.Henry said the exportation of a case from a country like Iran, which hasn't previously reported a lot of infections, also has parallels with the start of the epidemic in China.\"The first exported cases from China were similar,\" she said, \"and essentially an indication that there may be more cases than were recognized.\"If it is confirmed the traveller was infected in Iran,\u00a0then it likely means there's more than a handful of cases there, said\u00a0Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto General Hospital who is researching the outbreak.\"The real question is how much disease burden is in Iran and do they have the capacity to really get this under control,\" he said.\u00a0\"We might be inching toward this situation where this infection is not contained and we have to really be prepared for a possible scenario where there's more widespread transmission throughout the world.\"South Korea is also seeing a surge in new cases \u2014\u00a0reportedly linked to what authorities call a \"super-spreading event\" at a church congregation where the majority of infections originated.\"What we're hearing out of South Korea is starting to sound like alarming numbers,\" said Bogoch. \"But South Korea has a pretty robust medical system and a fantastic public health infrastructure.\"Bogoch said South Korea's health-care system was tested significantly with an epidemic of MERS in 2015, much like Toronto was with SARS in 2003.\"We learned incredible lessons from SARS that are really implemented to this day that are helping us cope with this COVID-19 epidemic,\" he said.\"Hopefully Korea has really learned some lessons from their MERS epidemic a few years ago to really help them cope with this.\"While\u00a0managing ill patients and preventing hospital outbreaks are key to a country's health-care infrastructure,\u00a0McGeer said\u00a0that infrastructure may have little to do with preventing the spread of the coronavirus.\"This is not about how strong your health-care system is,\" she said.\u00a0\"They may well be able to identify chains of transmission and quarantine and isolate people.\u00a0But the larger the number of cases, the more difficult it becomes.\"In northern Italy, officials shut down schools and public events after a cluster of 16 cases and one death were announced\u00a0Friday. Five of those cases were identified as health workers.WHO officials have pushed for countries to be transparent about their\u00a0cases, so resources can be shifted to where the need is greatest.For WHO, sub-Saharan Africa was a concern, given the degree of travel between China and Africa and limited ability to test for the virus in many African countries.Stephen Hoption Cann, an epidemiologist at the school of population and public health at the University of British Columbia, said if COVID-19 continues to spread worldwide, there is the possibility of the virus becoming endemic \u2014 or\u00a0 something that re-emerges on a seasonal basis.\"Are we going to be able to contain this virus and prevent it from spreading into the next season?\" he said. \"It's really hard to say now; it's looking like there's a possibility that we will be seeing it back again next winter.\"To read the entire\u00a0Second Opinion\u00a0newsletter every Saturday morning, subscribe by\u00a0clicking here.With files from Christine Birak and Marcy CuttlerAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

Andersen\nDepartment of Immunology and Microbiology,\nThe Scripps Research Institute,\nLa Jolla, CA 92037,\nUSA.Since the first reports of a novel pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China there has been considerable discussion and uncertainty over the origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 are now widespread in China, with cases in every province. As of 14 February 2020, 64,473 such cases have been confirmed, with 1,384 deaths attributed to the virus. These official case numbers are likely an underestimate because of limited reporting of mild and asymptomatic cases, and the virus is clearly capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. Based on the possibility of spread to countries with weaker healthcare systems, the World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). There are currently neither vaccines nor specific treatments for this disease.SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the  Coronaviridae  known to infect humans. Three of these viruses, SARS CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, can cause severe disease; four, HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E, are associated with mild respiratory symptoms. Herein, we review what can be deduced about the origin and early evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from the comparative analysis of available genome sequence data. In particular, we offer a perspective on the notable features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and discuss scenarios by which these features could have arisen. Importantly, this analysis provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct nor a purposefully manipulated virus.The genomic comparison of both alpha- and betacoronaviruses (family  Coronaviridae ) described below identifies two notable features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (i) based on structural modelling and early biochemical experiments, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be optimized for binding to the human ACE2 receptor; (ii) the highly variable spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1 and S2 boundary via the insertion of twelve nucleotides. Additionally, this event led to the acquisition of three predicted O-linked glycans around the polybasic cleavage site.The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses is the most variable part of the virus genome. Six residues in the RBD appear to be critical for binding to the human ACE2 receptor and determining host range1. Using coordinates based on the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV, they are Y442, L472, N479, D480, T487, and Y4911. The corresponding residues in SARS-CoV-2 are L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501, and Y505. Five of these six residues are mutated in SARS-CoV-2 compared to its most closely related virus, RaTG13 sampled from a  Rhinolophus affinis  bat, to which it is ~96% identical2 (Figure 1a). Based on modeling1 and biochemical experiments3,4, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have an RBD that may bind with high affinity to ACE2 from human, non-human primate, ferret, pig, and cat, as well as other species with high receptor homology1. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 may bind less efficiently to ACE2 in other species associated with SARS-like viruses, including rodents and civets1.The phenylalanine (F) at residue 486 in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein corresponds to L472 in the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. Notably, in SARS-CoV cell culture experiments the L472 mutates to phenylalanine (L472F)5, which is predicted to be optimal for binding of the SARS-CoV RBD to the human ACE2 receptor6. However, a phenylalanine in this position is also present in several SARS-like CoVs from bats (Figure 1a). While these analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of binding the human ACE2 receptor with high affinity, the interaction is not predicted to be optimal1. Additionally, several of the key residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 are different to those previously described as optimal for human ACE2 receptor binding6. In contrast to these computational predictions, recent binding studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 binds with high affinity to human ACE27. Thus the SARS-CoV-2 spike appears to be the result of selection on human or human-like ACE2 permitting another optimal binding solution to arise. This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is  not  the product of genetic engineering.The second notable feature of SARS-CoV-2 is a predicted polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2, the two subunits of the spike protein (Figure 1b)8,9. In addition to two basic arginines and an alanine at the cleavage site, a leading proline is also inserted; thus, the fully inserted sequence is PRRA (Figure 1b). The strong turn created by the proline insertion is predicted to result in the addition of O-linked glycans to S673, T678, and S686 that flank the polybasic cleavage site. A polybasic cleavage site has not previously been observed in related lineage B betacoronaviruses and is a unique feature of SARS-CoV-2. Some human betacoronaviruses, including HCoV-HKU1 (lineage A), have polybasic cleavage sites, as well as predicted O-linked glycans near the S1/S2 cleavage site.While the functional consequence of the polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, experiments with SARS-CoV have shown that engineering such a site at the S1/S2 junction enhances cell\u2013cell fusion but does not affect virus entry10. Polybasic cleavage sites allow effective cleavage by furin and other proteases, and can be acquired at the junction of the two subunits of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of avian influenza viruses in conditions that select for rapid virus replication and transmission (e.g. highly dense chicken populations). HA serves a similar function in cell-cell fusion and viral entry as the coronavirus S protein. Acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site in HA, by either insertion or recombination, converts low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses into highly pathogenic forms11-13. The acquisition of polybasic cleavage sites by the influenza virus HA has also been observed after repeated forced passage in cell culture or through animals14,15. Similarly, an avirulent isolate of Newcastle Disease virus became highly pathogenic during serial passage in chickens by incremental acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site at the junction of its fusion protein subunits16. The potential function of the three predicted O-linked glycans is less clear, but they could create a \u201cmucin-like domain\u201d that would shield potential epitopes or key residues on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Biochemical analyses or structural studies are required to determine whether or not the predicted O-linked glycan sites are utilized.figure2718\u00d71487 394 KBFigure 1. (a) Mutations in contact residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (top) was aligned against the most closely related SARS-like CoVs and SARS-CoV-1. Key residues in the spike protein that make contact to the ACE2 receptor are marked with blue boxes in both SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. ( b) Acquisition of polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans.  The polybasic cleavage site is marked in grey with the three adjacent predicted O-linked glycans in blue. Both the polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and not previously seen in lineage B betacoronaviruses. Sequences shown are from NCBI GenBank, accession numbers MN908947, MN996532, AY278741, KY417146, MK211376. The pangolin coronavirus sequences are a consensus generated from SRR10168377 and SRR10168378 (NCBI BioProject PRJNA573298)18,19.It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of an existing SARS-related coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for human ACE2 receptor binding with an efficient binding solution different to that which would have been predicted. Further, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one would expect that one of the several reverse genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would have been used. However, this is not the case as the genetic data shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone17. Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in a non-human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage in culture could have given rise to the same observed features.Selection in an animal host. As many of the early cases of COVID-19 were linked to the Huanan seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, it is possible that an animal source was present at this location. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, particularly RaTG13, it is plausible that bats serve as reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2. It is important, however, to note that previous outbreaks of betacoronaviruses in humans involved direct exposure to animals other than bats, including civets (SARS) and camels (MERS), that carry viruses that are genetically very similar to SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, respectively. By analogy, viruses closely related to SARS-Cov-2 may be circulating in one or more animal species. Initial analyses indicate that Malayan pangolins ( Manis javanica ) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain a CoV that is similar to SARS-CoV-218,19. Although the bat virus RaTG13 remains the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 across the whole genome, the Malayan pangolin CoV is identical to SARS-CoV-2 at all six key RBD residues (Figure 1). However, no pangolin CoV has yet been identified that is sufficiently similar to SARS-CoV-2 across its entire genome to support direct human infection. In addition, the pangolin CoV does not carry a polybasic cleavage site insertion. For a precursor virus to acquire the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the spike protein suitable for human ACE2 receptor binding, an animal host would likely have to have a high population density \u2013 to allow natural selection to proceed efficiently \u2013 and an ACE2 gene that is similar to the human orthologue. Further characterization of CoVs in pangolins and other animals that may harbour SARS-CoV-like viruses should be a public health priority.Cryptic adaptation to humans. It is also possible that a progenitor to SARS-CoV-2 jumped from a non-human animal to humans, with the genomic features described above acquired through adaptation during subsequent human-to-human transmission. We surmise that once these adaptations were acquired (either together or in series) it would enable the outbreak to take-off, producing a sufficiently large and unusual cluster of pneumonia cases to trigger the surveillance system that ultimately detected it.All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced so far have the well adapted RBD and the polybasic cleavage site, and are thus derived from a common ancestor that had these features. The presence of an RBD in pangolins that is very similar to the one in SARS-CoV-2 means that this was likely already present in the virus that jumped to humans, even if we don\u2019t yet have the exact non-human progenitor virus. This leaves the polybasic cleavage site insertion to occur during human-to-human transmission. Following the example of the influenza A virus HA gene, a specific insertion or recombination event is required to enable the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as an epidemic pathogen.Estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 using currently available genome sequence data point to virus emergence in late November to early December 201920,21, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases22. Hence, this scenario presumes a period of unrecognised transmission in humans between the initial zoonotic transfer event and the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site. Sufficient opportunity could occur if there had been many prior zoonotic events producing short chains of human-to-human transmission (so-called \u2018stuttering chains\u2019) over an extended period. This is essentially the situation for MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula where all the human cases are the result of repeated jumps of the virus from dromedary camels, producing single infections or short chains of transmission that eventually resolve. To date, after 2,499 cases over 8 years, no human adaptation has emerged that has allowed MERS-CoV to take hold in the human population.How could we test whether cryptic spread of SARS-CoV-2 enabled human adaptation?  Metagenomic studies of banked serum samples could provide important information, but given the relatively short period of viremia it may be impossible to detect low level SARS-CoV-2 circulation in historical samples. Retrospective serological studies potentially could be informative and a few such studies have already been conducted. One found that animal importation traders had a 13% seropositivity to coronaviruses23, while another noted that 3% residents of a village in Southern China were seropositive to these viruses24. Interestingly, 200 residents of Wuhan did not show coronavirus seroreactivity. Critically, however, these studies could not have distinguished whether positive serological responses were due to a prior infection with SARS-CoV-1 or -2. Further retrospective serological studies should be conducted to determine the extent of prior human exposure to betacoronaviruses in different geographic areas, particularly using assays that can distinguish among multiple betacoronaviruses.Selection during passage. Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models have been ongoing in BSL-2 for many years in multiple laboratories across the world25-28. There are also documented instances of the laboratory acquisition of SARS-CoV-1 by laboratory personnel working under BSL-2 containment29,30. We must therefore consider the possibility of a deliberate or inadvertent release of SARS-CoV-2. In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired the observed RBD mutations site during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in studies with SARS-CoV5 as well as MERS-CoV31. However, the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site or O-linked glycans - if functional - argues against this scenario. New polybasic cleavage sites have only been observed after prolonged passaging of low pathogenicity avian influenza virus in cell culture or animals. Furthermore, the generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with a very high genetic similarity. Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required an intense program of passage in cell culture or animals with ACE-2 receptor similar to humans (e.g. ferrets). It is also questionable whether generation of the O-linked glycans would have occurred on cell culture passage, as such mutations typically suggest the involvement of an immune system, that is not present  in vitro .In the midst of the global COVID-19 public health emergency it is reasonable to wonder why the origins of the epidemic matter. A detailed understanding of how an animal virus jumped species boundaries to infect humans so productively will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events. For example, if SARS-CoV-2 pre-adapted in another animal species then we are at risk of future re-emergence events even if the current epidemic is controlled. In contrast, if the adaptive process we describe occurred in humans, then even if we have repeated zoonotic transfers they are unlikely to take-off unless the same series of mutations occurs. In addition, identifying the closest animal relatives of SARS-CoV-2 will greatly assist studies of virus function. Indeed, the availability of the RaTG13 bat sequence facilitated the comparative genomic analysis performed here, helping to reveal the key mutations in the RBD as well as the polybasic cleavage site insertion.The genomic features described here may in part explain the infectiousness and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Although genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here, and it is unclear whether future data will help resolve this issue. Identifying the immediate non-human animal source and obtaining virus sequences from it would be the most definitive way of revealing virus origins. In addition, it would be helpful to obtain more genetic and functional data about the virus, including experimental studies of receptor binding and the role of the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans. The identification of a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the sequencing of very early cases including those not connected to the Wuhan market, would similarly be highly informative. Irrespective of how SARS-CoV-2 originated, the ongoing surveillance of pneumonia in humans and other animals is clearly of utmost importance.We thank all those who have contributed SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and contributed analyses and ideas to Virological.org (http://virological.org/).

I would add, however, that even if two virus isolates have an IDENTICAL amino acid sequence, that would not automatically make one the origin of the other. In my post 10 days ago, Tackling Rumors of a Suspicious Origin of nCoV2019 , I showed that mutations in the 3rd wobble base in an otherwise conserved region accumulate as to make seemingly identical viruses very much separated in time \u2013 indeed over decades.It is time to leave playing \u201cwho\u2019s ur daddy\u201d to daytime television. No known viral RNA sequence is the daddy of SARS-CoV-2. No match. If it doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit. It is all bat guano. Whatever analogy you like.

            "main_text": "At first, 23-year-old Khadar Abdi Abdullahi\u2019s eyes began turning yellow. Then the palms of his hands did the same. Soon he was bleeding from his nose, and from his mouth, and his body was swelling all over. Eventually, he collapsed with fever. He later died.A deadly sickness is spreading through villages near a Chinese natural gas project in Ethiopia\u2019s Somali region, according to locals and officials who spoke to The Guardian. Many of Khadar\u2019s neighbours have suffered the same symptoms. Like him, some died.It is not clear what is causing the sickness, and officials in the federal government in Addis Ababa firmly denied allegations both of a health and environmental crisis in the Somali region, or of any problems relating to large-scale energy projects there.Poly-GCL, a partly state-owned Chinese company, has been prospecting for oil and gas in the Ogaden Basin, as the vicinity is known,\u00a0since 2014. Calub, roughly 500km south-east of Jigjiga and near neighbouring Somalia, is due to start commercial gas production soon.Khadar, like many from the area, is suspicious that the sickness is caused by hazardous chemical waste that has poisoned the water supply.\u201cIt is the toxins that flow in the rainfall from Calub [gas field] that are responsible for this epidemic,\u201d said Khadar, as he sat outdoors in the eastern Ethiopian city of Jigjiga.He had recently been discharged from hospital; doctors there said there was nothing more they could do for him. He was weak and thin and his eyes were sinking into their sockets.\u201cThere are new diseases that have never been seen before in this area,\u201d said an adviser to the Somali regional government, speaking on condition of anonymity.\u201cWithout any public health protection, it is very clear that Poly-GCL uses chemicals that are detrimental to human health.\u201dIt is an allegation The Guardian heard repeatedly during a recent visit to the thinly populated scrubland that surrounds Calub gas field, though it was not able to independently verify its veracity.Poly-GCL did not respond to requests to comment.Ketsela Tadesse, director of licensing at the federal ministry of mines and petroleum, said the government was not aware of any reports of spillages, adding that in any case there were \u201cthere are no permanent settlers\u201d in the vicinity of the gas field.\u201cWe can emphatically state that all the gas wells at Calub and elsewhere in the Ogaden Basin, are sealed, safe and secured \u2026 according to international standards,\u201d Tadesse said.What is clear, however, is that the mysterious sickness has caused deaths.Ceeble Tuuba, a resident and prominent activist in the town of Haarcad, said her neighbour Cambaro Tawal was the first local to die from it, in 2014.\u201cThe widespread symptoms from which locals living around Calub die are different from all others,\u201d she said.Tuuba cited the example of her two-year-old nephew, who was taken to the hospital in Jigjiga earlier this year. He stayed there for a month, receiving multiple blood transfusions to no effect. He died after being discharged from hospital.His symptoms were those common to all who have contracted this unidentified sickness, she said: swelling, fever, sleeplessness, yellowing eyes and palms, and lack of appetite.A doctor from the referral hospital in Jijiga, who surveyed the area but wished to remain anonymous, said most of the symptoms locals exhibited in the clinics he visited were life-threatening.Ceeble said \u201ccountless\u201d of her neighbours had died in this way in recent years.Hassan Ali, a doctor at a health clinic in Haarcad, claimed there is a direct correlation between the number of reported cases in each village and its proximity to the Calub wells.Xuseen Sheekh Siraad, the chairman of Dhoobaweyn district, estimated that there have been at least 2 000 deaths since 2014.But there is no official death toll and those who live around Calub are predominantly nomadic pastoralists, whose contact with the Ethiopian government is limited. Many bury their dead without informing local officials.Furthermore, Hassan explained, most do not come to the clinic, and even if they do it does not have the facilities to treat or even diagnose serious cases such as liver failure.Last year, Poly-GCL conducted\u00a0the first-ever crude oil extraction tests\u00a0in the Ogaden Basin. It also\u00a0signed\u00a0a memorandum of understanding with neighbouring Djibouti to invest about R60.4-billion in building a\u00a0760km-pipeline from Ogaden to the Djiboutian coast, which will enable Ethiopia to export as much as\u00a06.3tn cubic feet\u00a0of natural gas.At a groundbreaking ceremony in June 2018, Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia\u2019s\u00a0Nobel prize-winning prime minister, said oil and gas would help alleviate the country\u2019s unemployment problem.\u201cOil production should never be a bane to us,\u201d he\u00a0declared, adding that earnings at full capacity could be as much as\u00a0R105-billion a year. Exports, he said, would begin in\u00a02021.But oil and gas exploration has a long and troubled history in the Ogaden.When the former Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie first embarked on oil exploration in the Ogaden in 1945,\u00a0mass demonstrations\u00a0forced him to suspend the project.Between 1955 and 1991,\u00a046 wells\u00a0were drilled at sites in Calub and Hilala. None were successful.In 2007, rebels from the secessionist Ogaden National Liberation Front\u00a0stormed\u00a0another Chinese-run oilfield, killing 74 workers and destroying the facility.The Ethiopian government responded by launching a counter-insurgency campaign involving tactics so brutal that Human Rights Watch said they amounted to\u00a0crimes against humanity. Whole villages around Calub were razed to the ground.The area remains heavily militarised, with police and soldiers patrolling the highway and the gas field\u2019s 40km restricted zone.Ismail Qamaan, 63, has lived his whole life in the Calub area and remembers the arrival of a German firm in the 1960s. He said a large truck recently drove across his neighbourhood, spilling a white substance.Deaths increased following this spillage according to Ismail. \u201cThey have destroyed everything that we had,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must account for what they did.\u201dBut the most serious allegations came from two former employees of Poly-GCL.Speaking on condition of anonymity, an engineer who worked for the company in Calub for three years said that there were regular spillages of deadly drilling fluids including sulphuric acid.Exposure to such chemicals can lead to\u00a0liver failure and stomach cancer.Ali Hassan Farah, another former employee, said that \u201cthose indigenous to the land die from raw toxins spilt out of sheer carelessness. Operational companies in Calub have forfeited their duty to protect local people.\u201dHowever, chemical spillages could have been caused by local Ethiopian transport firms, for instance, not Poly-GCL, and it is also possible that environmental damage predates the company\u2019s arrival in the area.At least two environmental impact assessments related to oil and gas development in the Ogaden have been carried out. The results have not been made public.Ketsela said all impact assessments had been \u201cchecked and certified by relevant governmental bodies, and the ministry of mines and petroleum has been monitoring the situation since then\u201d.Since August last year, there has been a new government in Somali region, led by acting state president Mustafa Omer, who has been\u00a0praised\u00a0for his reforms.An official told The Guardian that the region was trying to repair the\u00a0damage done\u00a0under its authoritarian predecessor, including in the management of natural resources.\u201cWe recognise the serious consequences of resource exploration, particularly for those living closest to exploration sites,\u201d said Abdikarim Abdirahman, the regional head of energy, mines and petroleum.\u201cWe have established an office for energy, mines and petroleum as well as an office dedicated to the environment \u2026 We are seriously dedicated to addressing the decades of marginalisation and abuse that have resulted from oil and gas exploration.\u201dMeanwhile, the federal government in Addis Ababa, the capital, recently announced a\u00a0revenue-sharing formula\u00a0that will grant the host region 50% of any income from oil or gas exploration, 10% of which will go directly to the production area. The rest will be split between the federal government and Ethiopia\u2019s other regions.Locals are sceptical. Many are particularly worried about the construction of the pipeline, for which feasibility studies are currently underway.They said that once again they have not been consulted, and feared it could further disrupt their grazing lands and natural environment.\u201cNot a single person has ever asked us about our plight,\u201d said Ismail.This feature was\u00a0originally published\u00a0as part of The Guardian\u2019s Global Development project.Log in to leave a comment",

            "main_text": "3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices slumped by nearly 4% on Monday as the rapid spread of the coronavirus in countries outside China added to investor concerns over the effect on demand for crude.Global equities also extended losses as worries about the impact of the virus grew, with the number of cases jumping in Iran, Italy and South Korea.Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell $2.20, or 3.8%, to settle at $56.30 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell $1.95, or 3.7%, to settle at $51.43 a barrel.\u201cThe reports of the coronavirus spreading is raising more fears of demand destruction,\u201d said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. \u201cWhen we saw the big move down in the stock market, oil traders were selling first and asking questions later.\u201dThe coronavirus has infected nearly 77,000 people and killed more than 2,500 in China, most of them in Hubei.South Korea\u2019s fourth-largest city, Daegu, was increasingly isolated as the number of infections there rose rapidly.Europe\u2019s biggest outbreak is in Italy, which reported a seventh death from the flu-like virus and 220 infections.Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Iraq on Monday recorded their first new coronavirus cases, all involving people who had been in Iran, which raised its toll from the disease to 12 dead and 61 infected.Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Turkey imposed travel and immigration curbs on Iran.Still, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that using the word \u201cpandemic\u201d did not fit the facts.\u201cWe must focus on containment while preparing for a potential pandemic,\u201d he told reporters in Geneva, adding that the world was not witnessing an uncontained spread or large-scale deaths.Saudi Aramco expects the coronavirus impact on oil demand to be short-lived and for consumption to rise in the second half of the year, Chief Executive Amin Nasser told Reuters.On Monday, local health officials in China said that four provinces had lowered their virus emergency response measures.Goldman Sachs said commodity prices could fall sharply before any rebound on the back of Chinese stimulus efforts.\u201cThe promise of stimulus has made commodity markets act like equity markets, building up risks of a sharp correction,\u201d the bank said in a note.Bank of America Global Research kept its 2020 forecast for the price of Brent crude steady at $62 a barrel, citing voluntary and involuntary declines in OPEC supply and the resilience of markets to geopolitical shocks.Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has decided to step up a sanctions campaign on Venezuela\u2019s oil sector and will be more aggressive in punishing people and companies that violate them, the top U.S. envoy to the Latin American country said.Additional reporting by Noah Browning in London and Jessica Jaganathan in Singapore; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Jason NeelyAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

            "headline": "Some Samsung, Hyundai workers self-quarantine as Korea Inc braces for virus impact",
            "main_text": "4 Min ReadSEOUL (Reuters) - Some South Korean workers at Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) are staying home as a precautionary measure as corporate Korea scrambles to prevent the coronavirus outbreak from causing widespread disruption in its home market.The country\u2019s third-largest conglomerate SK Group, which controls memory chip maker SK Hynix (000660.KS) and mobile carrier SK Telecom (017670.KS), advised its employees to work remotely starting from Tuesday due to the coronavirus outbreak.About 1,500 workers of Samsung Electronics\u2019 phone complex in the southeastern city of Gumi have self-quarantined after one of its workers was infected with the disease, a person familiar with the matter said. They include 900 workers who commute to Gumi from neighboring Daegu city, the person said.The southeastern city of Daegu - the epicenter of the virus outbreak in South Korea- and nearby cities are an industrial hub in South Korea, Asia\u2019s fourth-biggest economy, and home to factories of Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor and a number of others.South Korea on Monday reported 161 new cases of the coronavirus, bringing the total number of infected patients in the country to 763, a day after the government raised its infectious disease alert to its highest level.Samsung Electronics shares fell 4.1% and Hyundai Motor ended down 4.3%, tracking the wider market's .KS11 3.9% fall, as the  spike in new coronavirus cases intensified fears about the epidemic's fallout on the economy and businesses.Samsung said it has restarted production at its phone factory complex in Gumi on Monday, after closing it over the weekend, adding that the floor where the infected employee worked will resume production on Tuesday.\u201cAs of 1 p.m. KT (0400 GMT) Feb. 24, the Gumi Complex has started normal operations and we expect no impact on production,\u201d Samsung said in a statement, without elaborating further.Samsung\u2019s Gumi factory accounts for a small portion of its total phone production, but it produces premium phones and foldable phones, research firm Counterpoint said.Six employees at Hyundai Motor\u2019s factories in the southeastern city of Ulsan are also at home, with four of them linked to a church at the center of the virus outbreak, a union spokesman said in a statement.\u201cWe are walking on ice,\u201d one Hyundai factory worker told Reuters.A factory run by Hyundai supplier Seojin Industrial was closed over the weekend after the death of a virus-infected worker, an official at the supplier said. He said that authorities disinfected the factory, located in the city of Gyeongju, and it is unclear when production will resume.Seojin declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.Any disruption would be a fresh blow to Hyundai, which has restarted most of its domestic factories\u2019 production after being hit by suspensions due to parts shortages from China.Ulsan is home to Hyundai\u2019s biggest car factories, and there are a number of suppliers in the city and surrounding areas, which cater not only to the automaker, but export to the United States, Japan and other markets.A Hyundai Motor spokesman said there has been no production disruption so far as the automaker has inventory.With virus fears spreading nationwide, Hyundai set up thermal cameras at all of its operations across the nation, including its headquarters in Seoul, to check temperatures.Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Joyce Lee; Additional reporting by Heekyong Yang; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan and Muralikumar Anantharaman and Kirsten DonovanhAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Although African swine fever is not harmful to humans, there is no vaccine for the virus yet. Therefore, we need to be careful.\nThe biosecurity of pig farms plays a pivotal role in preventing any ASF outbreak. Preventive measures that need to be taken include spraying pig markets with disinfectants, avoiding feeding of leftover feedstuff to domestic pigs, systematic farming, purchasing only pedigree pigs, and carrying out separate farming of newly purchased pigs and existing pigs.\nIn addition, people must avoid consuming imported frozen pig and pork products such as bacon, ham, and sausage, according to officials. Hunting wild pigs and farming of wild pigs with domestic pigs must be avoided.\nThe local health authorities should remain on the alert and keep in touch with pig farmers so they can immediately detect any suspicious signs in pig farms.\nThe symptoms of ASF \u2014 red spots on the body, diarrhea, vomiting, and trembling \u2014 are similar to those of other diseases common to pigs, which also lead to the deaths of pigs. Therefore, only the results of a laboratory test are reliable.\nEducating pig farmers about the virus is paramount. Knowledge of ASF should be within the reach of local pig farmers to ensure that they know what symptoms to look out for and how to effectively deal with an outbreak to prevent the virus from spreading.\nBusinesses and the general public must be provided up-to-date information on which types of products are prohibited and from which countries.",

They didn\u2019t know which hospital to visit next, or what treatment to seek.The COVID-19 epidemic that originated in Wuhan late last year has choked the city\u2019s health system, killing over 2,600 people and infecting nearly 80,000 worldwide. To cope with the overwhelming number of patients infected with the coronavirus, the city has converted many of its general and specialist hospitals, as well as public venues, into facilities for treating COVID-19 cases.Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital was one of the first to be repurposed, and there are currently 48 medical facilities in the city that have been\u00a0designated\u00a0for treating coronavirus patients. However, with the focus concentrated on containing the epidemic, patients with other diseases say they have struggled to get medical attention, becoming \u201cinvisible victims\u201d of COVID-19.An empty dialysis room at the Hanyang branch of Wuhan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hubei province, Jan. 28, 2020. From @\u65b0\u4eac\u62a5 on WeiboAfter Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital told Ye to make alternative arrangements, he tried to contact other hospitals in the city, but to no avail. Some told him they had run out of beds, while others said they were unable to treat his condition.\u201cWe tried everything \u2014 calling an ambulance, begging doctors, asking friends and relatives for help, seeking help on social media,\u201d Ye said. \u201cNothing worked.\u201dWith no alternative, Ye took his sick father-in-law home, where he is now hooked up to a respirator. He hasn\u2019t eaten for the past five days, and his condition is deteriorating.\u201cWe cannot do anything but wait at home for him to die,\u201d Ye said. \u201cI feel so helpless. I don\u2019t even know what to do if he dies. It\u2019s like there\u2019s no way to live, and there\u2019s no way to die.\u201dAlso caught in the coronavirus crossfire are people with HIV. With the ongoing restrictions on movement, many are holed-up in their homes, unable to access antiretroviral therapies that would help them enjoy longer, healthier lives.Huang Haojie, director of the Wuhan LGBT Center, told Sixth Tone that the center has received a flood of messages from concerned individuals. \u201cThe sudden lockdown in Wuhan has made it extremely difficult for HIV patients to get medicine,\u201d he said.In China, HIV medications are only accessible in specific hospitals where individuals are registered. Many living with HIV refrain from seeking help from family and friends due to the stigma associated with the disease.\u201cPeople are afraid of going without the medicine, but they are more afraid of (their disease) being discovered by their family,\u201d Huang said, adding that some people with HIV were visiting their families for the Lunar New Year and are likely still with them.Though China\u2019s National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention\u00a0temporarily allowed patients to get their monthly dose of HIV medication without registering, Huang said such a \u201cquick response\u201d to the epidemic doesn\u2019t completely address the problem. For many in rural areas, a total shutdown of transportation during the lockdown means they cannot travel to get their drugs.\u201cOne HIV patient from the countryside told our center that he set off from his village at 6 a.m. and returned home at 6 p.m. \u2014 he walked all day to get the medicine,\u201d Huang said.A screenshot from a video about a mother trying to leave Hubei province to get chemotherapy for her daughter, who has leukemia, February 2020. From Reuters\u2019 YouTube channelEarlier this month, a video of a mother frantically trying to take her daughter out of Hubei for treatment made headlines in China, underscoring the plight of people who feel helpless as they struggle to take care of sick family members. In the video, the woman is seen pleading with police, saying her daughter with leukemia isn\u2019t able to get chemotherapy because of the surge in coronavirus patients.To address the needs of patients other than the ones diagnosed with COVID-19, the Hubei\u00a0provincial government\u00a0announced a list of hospitals for such patients last week. The 50 hospitals in Wuhan have been designated for critically ill patients, pregnant women, infants, and those who require dialysis.Li Hua, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect her privacy, told Sixth Tone that the coronavirus epidemic has been a \u201cnightmare\u201d for her as she tries to get treatment for her mother, who was diagnosed with late-stage lymphoma in early January. Though the provincial government\u2019s designated hospitals have made it easier to secure a bed at the Hubei Cancer Hospital, she is still uncertain how long they\u2019ll be able to stay there.Before her mother was hospitalized Thursday, Li said they were turned away by two hospitals, both of which had been reserved for coronavirus patients. She\u2019s worried because lymphoma patients need continuous chemotherapy, and her mother may not be able to physically get to the next chemotherapy session.\u201cI don\u2019t know what tomorrow will hold,\u201d said the 26-year-old, who spends much of her time online these days searching for treatment-related information. \u201cYou have to depend on yourself. Medical resources are in dire straits.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how long the lockdown is going to last,\u201d she said. \u201cI can only hope our family can get through this period safely.\u201dEditor: Bibek Bhandari.(Header image: IC)Copyright \u00a9 2016~2020 \u00a0Sixth Tone.\n                        All Rights Reserved.SIXTH TONEFresh voices from today's ChinaDownload",

            "main_text": "Experts say it\u2019s time to start using the \u2018p-word\u2019, and people with medical conditions should \u2018get ahead\u2019 on their prescriptionsBen DohertyTue 25 Feb 2020 03.30 AEDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2020 16.37 AEDTAs cases of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus rise outside of China health experts in Australia argue a global coronavirus pandemic \u201cis very likely, if not inevitable\u201d.Some say the world is already in the early stages of a pandemic, which is defined by the World Health Organisation as a disease spreading across two continents.Clusters of Covid-19 \u2013 the illness caused by the novel coronavirus (officially known as Sars-CoV-2) \u2013 are emerging all over the world, with some showing no obvious link to China, leaving experts struggling to determine where they started and how they have spread.Globally, there have been 78,973 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 2,466 deaths. The vast majority of infections and deaths have been in mainland China, centred around central Hubei province.How does a country like Australia, geographically remote and with a limited number of mild cases \u2013 all of which have been traced back to their origin \u2013 counter a pandemic?Under the Australian government\u2019s Emergency Response Plan for Covid-19, the \u201cinitial action\u201d response when cases are first identified in Australia is focused on \u201cminimising transmission\u201d and \u201cmanaging initial cases\u201d. It involves border measures such as health screenings at airports and ports, escalating to travel bans, which are currently in place for travellers from mainland China.Confirmed cases are tracked backwards to find points of infection, and potential contacts \u2013 such as fellow passengers on flights \u2013 alerted to the potential that they have been exposed to the disease.Those who have been exposed to suspected cases are asked to self-isolate at home. Citizens and permanent residents returning from known hotspots face periods of enforced quarantine.If, and as, cases escalate, hospitals can be advised to consider bringing in additional \u201csurge staff\u201d and state governments asked to consider establishing \u201cfever clinics\u201d or other alternative models of care \u201cto minimise the burden on the health system\u201d.Places where outbreaks could spread especially rapidly, or could impact upon vulnerable populations \u2013 residential aged care facilities, schools and prisons \u2013 can be given extra support and staff to investigate and manage outbreaks.Australia\u2019s Covid-19 plan draws from the Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza, which contemplates a novel coronavirus from which the Australian population would have little immunity.\u201cCurrently, there are no effective anti-virals available and there is no vaccine. Availability of a customised novel coronavirus vaccine would be the greatest tool in reducing the impact. It is still not known if or when this might be available,\u201d the emergency response plan reads, noting that there is still no vaccine available for the other major coronaviruses Sars and Mers.Government-directed social distancing measures may increase from reactively \u2013 or, if necessary, preemptively \u2013 closing schools if it appears children are particularly susceptible; encouraging, or potentially mandating, workplace closures and working from home; and cancelling large public events.And Australia will also attempt to insulate itself from any growing pandemic with increasing travel advisories for countries that are experiencing significant outbreaks.Already, the Department of Foreign Affairs has raised the travel advisory for China to the highest level: \u201cDo Not Travel\u201d, and told its citizens already in the country they should leave the country as soon as they are able.On Monday, the Australian government raised its travel advice for both South Korea and Japan.\u201cBased on advice from Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, we now recommend you \u2018exercise a high degree of caution\u2019... due to a heightened risk of sustained local transmission of coronavirus (Covid-19),\u201d Dfat said of both countries.Risk communication experts Jody Lanard and Peter Sandman have argued that with the rise in cases globally, \u201cit\u2019s a good time to think about how to use the \u2018P-word\u2019 (pandemic) in talking about Covid-19\u201d.\u201cThe most crucial (and overdue) risk communication task for the next few days is to help people visualise their communities when \u2018keeping it out\u2019 \u2013 containment \u2013 is no longer relevant. The P word is a good way to launch this message.\u201dLanard and Sandman say there are measures individuals can take to prepare for and deal with a potential global outbreak.They advise people with medical conditions to \u201cget ahead\u201d on prescriptions if possible \u201cin case of very predictable supply chain disruptions, and so they won\u2019t have to go out to the pharmacy at a time when there may be long lines of sick people\u201d.Lanard and Sandman also recommend people slowly starting to stock up on non-perishable food \u201cto last their households through several weeks of social distancing at home during an intense wave of transmission in their community\u201d.\u201cAnd the example we like the best, because it gives every single person an immediate action that they can take over and over: right now, today, start practicing not touching your face when you are out and about!\u201cYou probably won\u2019t be able to do it perfectly, but you can greatly reduce the frequency of potential self-inoculation. You can even institute a buddy system, where friends and colleagues are asked to remind each other when someone scratches her eyelid or rubs his nose.\u201dThe government\u2019s emergency response plan says Australia is well placed globally to respond to any widespread outbreak, but that the risks should not be under-estimated.\u201cThe novel coronavirus outbreak represents a significant risk to Australia. It has the potential to cause high levels of morbidity and mortality and to disrupt our community socially and economically.\u201dThis month, the Australian government updated its Australian Health Sector Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19). The plan outlines a staged response to a worsening pandemic: Australia is currently in the \u201cinitial action\u201d stage.The emergency response plans says impact of the outbreak will be determined by:the clinical severity of the outbreak (how severe cases are, and many people need to be hospitalised)its transmissibility (how easily it is spread, currently it has a preliminary reproduction number of 1.4 to 2.5)the capacity of the health system to treat infected patientsthe effectiveness of interventions to treat the illness or stop it spreadingVictoria\u2019s chief health minister, Dr Brett Sutton, said all Australian states, along with the commonwealth government, have been working on pandemic preparedness for weeks.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that with local transmission in several countries a pandemic is very likely, if not inevitable. We are working rapidly on planning and surge with our health sector.\u201cWe\u2019ve provided guidance to practitioners and many communications materials but are now focused on the models of care that will need to be in place \u2013 clinics, phone triage, home care, right through to ICU and aged care.\u201d\u201cVictoria and Australia nonetheless remain completely in containment mode,\u201d Sutton said, \u201cidentifying any possible case; isolating those who are infectious; and quarantining contacts. Regardless of developments internationally, this gives all of us time and space to plan and prepare.\u201d",

            "headline": "2019-2020 U.S. Flu Season: Preliminary Burden Estimates",
            "main_text": "*Because influenza surveillance does not capture all cases of flu that occur in the U.S., CDC provides these estimated ranges to better reflect the larger burden of influenza. These estimates are calculated based on CDC\u2019s weekly influenza surveillance data and are preliminary.This web page provides weekly, preliminary estimates of the cumulative in-season numbers of flu illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States. CDC does not know the exact number of people who have been sick and affected by influenza because influenza is not a reportable disease in most areas of the U.S. However, CDC has estimated the burden of flu since 2010 using a mathematical model that is based on data\u00a0collected through the U.S. Influenza Surveillance System, a network that\u00a0covers approximately 8.5% of the U.S. population (~27 million people).The estimates of the cumulative burden of seasonal influenza are subject to several limitations.First, the cumulative rate of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations reported during the season may be an under-estimate of the rate at the end of the season because of identification and reporting delays.Second, rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations were adjusted for the frequency of influenza testing and the sensitivity of influenza diagnostic assays. However, data on testing practices during the 2019-2020 season are not available in real-time. CDC used data on testing practices from the past influenza seasons as a proxy. Burden estimates will be updated at a later date when data on contemporary testing practices become available.Third, estimates of influenza-associated illness and medical visits are based on data from prior seasons, which may not be accurate if the seriousness of illness or patterns of care-seeking have changed.The cumulative burden of influenza is an estimate of the number of people who have been sick, seen a healthcare provider, been hospitalized, or died as a result of influenza since October 01, 2018. CDC does not know the exact number of people who have been sick and affected by influenza because influenza is not a reportable disease in most areas of the United States. However, these numbers are estimated using a mathematical model, based on observed rates of laboratory-confirmed\u00a0influenza-associated hospitalizations.Preliminary estimates of the cumulative burden of seasonal influenza during the 2019-2020 season in the United States are based on crude rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations, reported through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET),\u00a0which were adjusted for the frequency of influenza testing during recent prior seasons and the sensitivity of influenza diagnostic assays. Rates of hospitalization were then multiplied by previously estimated ratio of hospitalizations to symptomatic illnesses, and frequency of seeking medical care to calculate symptomatic illnesses, medical visits, and deaths associated with seasonal influenza, respectively.The estimates of cumulative burden of seasonal influenza are considered preliminary and may change each week as new laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations are reported to CDC. New reports include both new admissions that have occurred during the reporting week and also patients admitted in previous weeks that have been newly reported to CDC.The number of hospitalizations estimated so far this season is lower than end-of-season total hospitalization estimates for any season since CDC began making these estimates. This table also summarizes all estimated influenza disease burden, by season, in U.S. from 2010-11 through 2017-18.*These estimates are preliminary\u00a0and based on data from CDC\u2019s\u00a0 weekly influenza surveillance\u00a0reports summarizing key influenza activity indicators.Estimated number of influenza-associated hospitalizationsThe y-axis extends from 0 to 1 million.The x-axis is a timeline starting October 5, 2019 and extending to May 30, 2020.There is a single blue-shaded curve labeled with \u201c2019/20\u201d.There are several other lines on the right side of the graph under Total hospitalizations at end of past seasons. The lines are labeled, from top to bottom, as 2018/19, 2017/18, 2014/15, 2016/17, 2012/13, 2013/14, 2015/16, 2010/11, and 2011/12 and represent the estimated burden for these seasons.\u00a0 This allows for the comparison of the current season to past seasons.To receive weekly email updates about Seasonal Flu, enter your email address:",

            "main_text": "Canada is preparing to respond to a possible pandemic as the number of coronavirus cases continues to climb around the globe.Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said the global threat posed by the novel coronavirus,\u00a0which can lead to a respiratory illness called COVID-19, is evolving fast. While the outbreak continues to be contained mostly to the epicentre in Hubei, China, she noted that the virus is spreading now\u00a0at the community level, person-to-person, in several other countries.\"These\u00a0signs are concerning, and they mean that the window of opportunity for containment ... for stopping the global spread of the virus, is closing,\" Tam told reporters in a teleconference Monday.\"It also tells countries like Canada, that have been able to manage and detect cases so far, that we have to prepare across governments, across communities, and as families and individuals, in the event of more widespread transmission in our community.\"The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, but so far hasn't declared it a\u00a0pandemic.Tam said the trajectory of the coronavirus is unknown at this time and it's possible that cases have occurred in other countries that don't have the proper tools to diagnose and contain it.Canada developed a pandemic response plan in 2009, which would serve as the foundation for any shift in the official\u00a0response to the current outbreak, she said.The response plan includes accelerating research work here and contributing to international efforts to develop a vaccine abroad. Tam said it\u00a0also could lead to expanding laboratory testing capabilities and access to diagnostic tools, and taking stock of\u00a0essential supplies to make sure authorities don't run short. She added\u00a0that Canada's course of action would be much the same whether the WHO declares a pandemic or not.Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Monday that a pandemic declaration by the WHO would render travel restrictions meaningless because it would mean that efforts to contain the virus had failed.\"As the window closes in terms of stopping the global spread, as we watch the WHO assess whether or not this is a full pandemic, obviously our attention turns more toward our domestic preparedness and what Canada can do to make sure our system and structures are ready for a change in our own population,\" she said.The WHO said today that\u00a0China has reported\u00a077,362 cases of COVID-19, including 2,618 deaths.Outside China, there are now 2,074 cases in 28 countries, including 10 in Canada, and 23 related deaths.Despite the rising numbers, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said officials are encouraged by the fact that the number of new cases continues to decline in China.The epidemic peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been steadily\u00a0declining since, he said.Tedros said a decision on whether to declare a pandemic is based on an ongoing assessment of the geographical spread of the virus, the severity of the disease\u00a0and its impact on society.\"For the moment, we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus, and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or death,\" he said.\"Does this virus have pandemic potential? Absolutely\u00a0it has. Are we there yet? From our assessment, not yet.\"Tedros said labelling the outbreak a pandemic could create unnecessary fear.Tam said that the goal now is to slow the spread of the virus, adding it's\u00a0difficult to stop its spread because more countries are reporting people with no or mild symptoms.Canada has been successful so far in detecting imported cases and preventing person-to-person spread within communities,\u00a0but is preparing for other scenarios, Tam said.Tam said enhanced border control measures and messaging at airports will be broadened to include warnings to travellers returning from other countries with reported cases of coronavirus.She said international travellers arriving at Canadian airports will be told to self-isolate if they're experiencing flu-like symptoms.Tam said all travellers should take general precautions and plan ahead by, for instance, making sure they have\u00a0enough medication for a trip.She repeated the standard public health messages encouraging people to\u00a0wash their hands frequently, cover coughs and sneezes, keep track of federal travel health advice posted online and share travel history with health-care providers in the event of becoming\u00a0sick.With files from the CBC's Amina ZafarTo encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).
