Andersen\nDepartment of Immunology and Microbiology,\nThe Scripps Research Institute,\nLa Jolla, CA 92037,\nUSA.Since the first reports of a novel pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China there has been considerable discussion and uncertainty over the origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 are now widespread in China, with cases in every province. As of 14 February 2020, 64,473 such cases have been confirmed, with 1,384 deaths attributed to the virus. These official case numbers are likely an underestimate because of limited reporting of mild and asymptomatic cases, and the virus is clearly capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. Based on the possibility of spread to countries with weaker healthcare systems, the World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). There are currently neither vaccines nor specific treatments for this disease.SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the  Coronaviridae  known to infect humans. Three of these viruses, SARS CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, can cause severe disease; four, HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E, are associated with mild respiratory symptoms. Herein, we review what can be deduced about the origin and early evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from the comparative analysis of available genome sequence data. In particular, we offer a perspective on the notable features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and discuss scenarios by which these features could have arisen. Importantly, this analysis provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct nor a purposefully manipulated virus.The genomic comparison of both alpha- and betacoronaviruses (family  Coronaviridae ) described below identifies two notable features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (i) based on structural modelling and early biochemical experiments, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be optimized for binding to the human ACE2 receptor; (ii) the highly variable spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1 and S2 boundary via the insertion of twelve nucleotides. Additionally, this event led to the acquisition of three predicted O-linked glycans around the polybasic cleavage site.The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses is the most variable part of the virus genome. Six residues in the RBD appear to be critical for binding to the human ACE2 receptor and determining host range1. Using coordinates based on the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV, they are Y442, L472, N479, D480, T487, and Y4911. The corresponding residues in SARS-CoV-2 are L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501, and Y505. Five of these six residues are mutated in SARS-CoV-2 compared to its most closely related virus, RaTG13 sampled from a  Rhinolophus affinis  bat, to which it is ~96% identical2 (Figure 1a). Based on modeling1 and biochemical experiments3,4, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have an RBD that may bind with high affinity to ACE2 from human, non-human primate, ferret, pig, and cat, as well as other species with high receptor homology1. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 may bind less efficiently to ACE2 in other species associated with SARS-like viruses, including rodents and civets1.The phenylalanine (F) at residue 486 in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein corresponds to L472 in the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. Notably, in SARS-CoV cell culture experiments the L472 mutates to phenylalanine (L472F)5, which is predicted to be optimal for binding of the SARS-CoV RBD to the human ACE2 receptor6. However, a phenylalanine in this position is also present in several SARS-like CoVs from bats (Figure 1a). While these analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of binding the human ACE2 receptor with high affinity, the interaction is not predicted to be optimal1. Additionally, several of the key residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 are different to those previously described as optimal for human ACE2 receptor binding6. In contrast to these computational predictions, recent binding studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 binds with high affinity to human ACE27. Thus the SARS-CoV-2 spike appears to be the result of selection on human or human-like ACE2 permitting another optimal binding solution to arise. This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is  not  the product of genetic engineering.The second notable feature of SARS-CoV-2 is a predicted polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2, the two subunits of the spike protein (Figure 1b)8,9. In addition to two basic arginines and an alanine at the cleavage site, a leading proline is also inserted; thus, the fully inserted sequence is PRRA (Figure 1b). The strong turn created by the proline insertion is predicted to result in the addition of O-linked glycans to S673, T678, and S686 that flank the polybasic cleavage site. A polybasic cleavage site has not previously been observed in related lineage B betacoronaviruses and is a unique feature of SARS-CoV-2. Some human betacoronaviruses, including HCoV-HKU1 (lineage A), have polybasic cleavage sites, as well as predicted O-linked glycans near the S1/S2 cleavage site.While the functional consequence of the polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, experiments with SARS-CoV have shown that engineering such a site at the S1/S2 junction enhances cell\u2013cell fusion but does not affect virus entry10. Polybasic cleavage sites allow effective cleavage by furin and other proteases, and can be acquired at the junction of the two subunits of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of avian influenza viruses in conditions that select for rapid virus replication and transmission (e.g. highly dense chicken populations). HA serves a similar function in cell-cell fusion and viral entry as the coronavirus S protein. Acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site in HA, by either insertion or recombination, converts low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses into highly pathogenic forms11-13. The acquisition of polybasic cleavage sites by the influenza virus HA has also been observed after repeated forced passage in cell culture or through animals14,15. Similarly, an avirulent isolate of Newcastle Disease virus became highly pathogenic during serial passage in chickens by incremental acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site at the junction of its fusion protein subunits16. The potential function of the three predicted O-linked glycans is less clear, but they could create a \u201cmucin-like domain\u201d that would shield potential epitopes or key residues on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Biochemical analyses or structural studies are required to determine whether or not the predicted O-linked glycan sites are utilized.figure2718\u00d71487 394 KBFigure 1. (a) Mutations in contact residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (top) was aligned against the most closely related SARS-like CoVs and SARS-CoV-1. Key residues in the spike protein that make contact to the ACE2 receptor are marked with blue boxes in both SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. ( b) Acquisition of polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans.  The polybasic cleavage site is marked in grey with the three adjacent predicted O-linked glycans in blue. Both the polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and not previously seen in lineage B betacoronaviruses. Sequences shown are from NCBI GenBank, accession numbers MN908947, MN996532, AY278741, KY417146, MK211376. The pangolin coronavirus sequences are a consensus generated from SRR10168377 and SRR10168378 (NCBI BioProject PRJNA573298)18,19.It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of an existing SARS-related coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for human ACE2 receptor binding with an efficient binding solution different to that which would have been predicted. Further, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one would expect that one of the several reverse genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would have been used. However, this is not the case as the genetic data shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone17. Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in a non-human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage in culture could have given rise to the same observed features.Selection in an animal host. As many of the early cases of COVID-19 were linked to the Huanan seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, it is possible that an animal source was present at this location. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, particularly RaTG13, it is plausible that bats serve as reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2. It is important, however, to note that previous outbreaks of betacoronaviruses in humans involved direct exposure to animals other than bats, including civets (SARS) and camels (MERS), that carry viruses that are genetically very similar to SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, respectively. By analogy, viruses closely related to SARS-Cov-2 may be circulating in one or more animal species. Initial analyses indicate that Malayan pangolins ( Manis javanica ) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain a CoV that is similar to SARS-CoV-218,19. Although the bat virus RaTG13 remains the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 across the whole genome, the Malayan pangolin CoV is identical to SARS-CoV-2 at all six key RBD residues (Figure 1). However, no pangolin CoV has yet been identified that is sufficiently similar to SARS-CoV-2 across its entire genome to support direct human infection. In addition, the pangolin CoV does not carry a polybasic cleavage site insertion. For a precursor virus to acquire the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the spike protein suitable for human ACE2 receptor binding, an animal host would likely have to have a high population density \u2013 to allow natural selection to proceed efficiently \u2013 and an ACE2 gene that is similar to the human orthologue. Further characterization of CoVs in pangolins and other animals that may harbour SARS-CoV-like viruses should be a public health priority.Cryptic adaptation to humans. It is also possible that a progenitor to SARS-CoV-2 jumped from a non-human animal to humans, with the genomic features described above acquired through adaptation during subsequent human-to-human transmission. We surmise that once these adaptations were acquired (either together or in series) it would enable the outbreak to take-off, producing a sufficiently large and unusual cluster of pneumonia cases to trigger the surveillance system that ultimately detected it.All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced so far have the well adapted RBD and the polybasic cleavage site, and are thus derived from a common ancestor that had these features. The presence of an RBD in pangolins that is very similar to the one in SARS-CoV-2 means that this was likely already present in the virus that jumped to humans, even if we don\u2019t yet have the exact non-human progenitor virus. This leaves the polybasic cleavage site insertion to occur during human-to-human transmission. Following the example of the influenza A virus HA gene, a specific insertion or recombination event is required to enable the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as an epidemic pathogen.Estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 using currently available genome sequence data point to virus emergence in late November to early December 201920,21, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases22. Hence, this scenario presumes a period of unrecognised transmission in humans between the initial zoonotic transfer event and the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site. Sufficient opportunity could occur if there had been many prior zoonotic events producing short chains of human-to-human transmission (so-called \u2018stuttering chains\u2019) over an extended period. This is essentially the situation for MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula where all the human cases are the result of repeated jumps of the virus from dromedary camels, producing single infections or short chains of transmission that eventually resolve. To date, after 2,499 cases over 8 years, no human adaptation has emerged that has allowed MERS-CoV to take hold in the human population.How could we test whether cryptic spread of SARS-CoV-2 enabled human adaptation?  Metagenomic studies of banked serum samples could provide important information, but given the relatively short period of viremia it may be impossible to detect low level SARS-CoV-2 circulation in historical samples. Retrospective serological studies potentially could be informative and a few such studies have already been conducted. One found that animal importation traders had a 13% seropositivity to coronaviruses23, while another noted that 3% residents of a village in Southern China were seropositive to these viruses24. Interestingly, 200 residents of Wuhan did not show coronavirus seroreactivity. Critically, however, these studies could not have distinguished whether positive serological responses were due to a prior infection with SARS-CoV-1 or -2. Further retrospective serological studies should be conducted to determine the extent of prior human exposure to betacoronaviruses in different geographic areas, particularly using assays that can distinguish among multiple betacoronaviruses.Selection during passage. Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models have been ongoing in BSL-2 for many years in multiple laboratories across the world25-28. There are also documented instances of the laboratory acquisition of SARS-CoV-1 by laboratory personnel working under BSL-2 containment29,30. We must therefore consider the possibility of a deliberate or inadvertent release of SARS-CoV-2. In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired the observed RBD mutations site during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in studies with SARS-CoV5 as well as MERS-CoV31. However, the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site or O-linked glycans - if functional - argues against this scenario. New polybasic cleavage sites have only been observed after prolonged passaging of low pathogenicity avian influenza virus in cell culture or animals. Furthermore, the generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with a very high genetic similarity. Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required an intense program of passage in cell culture or animals with ACE-2 receptor similar to humans (e.g. ferrets). It is also questionable whether generation of the O-linked glycans would have occurred on cell culture passage, as such mutations typically suggest the involvement of an immune system, that is not present  in vitro .In the midst of the global COVID-19 public health emergency it is reasonable to wonder why the origins of the epidemic matter. A detailed understanding of how an animal virus jumped species boundaries to infect humans so productively will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events. For example, if SARS-CoV-2 pre-adapted in another animal species then we are at risk of future re-emergence events even if the current epidemic is controlled. In contrast, if the adaptive process we describe occurred in humans, then even if we have repeated zoonotic transfers they are unlikely to take-off unless the same series of mutations occurs. In addition, identifying the closest animal relatives of SARS-CoV-2 will greatly assist studies of virus function. Indeed, the availability of the RaTG13 bat sequence facilitated the comparative genomic analysis performed here, helping to reveal the key mutations in the RBD as well as the polybasic cleavage site insertion.The genomic features described here may in part explain the infectiousness and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Although genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here, and it is unclear whether future data will help resolve this issue. Identifying the immediate non-human animal source and obtaining virus sequences from it would be the most definitive way of revealing virus origins. In addition, it would be helpful to obtain more genetic and functional data about the virus, including experimental studies of receptor binding and the role of the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans. The identification of a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the sequencing of very early cases including those not connected to the Wuhan market, would similarly be highly informative. Irrespective of how SARS-CoV-2 originated, the ongoing surveillance of pneumonia in humans and other animals is clearly of utmost importance.We thank all those who have contributed SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and contributed analyses and ideas to Virological.org (http://virological.org/).

I would add, however, that even if two virus isolates have an IDENTICAL amino acid sequence, that would not automatically make one the origin of the other. In my post 10 days ago, Tackling Rumors of a Suspicious Origin of nCoV2019 , I showed that mutations in the 3rd wobble base in an otherwise conserved region accumulate as to make seemingly identical viruses very much separated in time \u2013 indeed over decades.It is time to leave playing \u201cwho\u2019s ur daddy\u201d to daytime television. No known viral RNA sequence is the daddy of SARS-CoV-2. No match. If it doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit. It is all bat guano. Whatever analogy you like.

Andersen\nDepartment of Immunology and Microbiology,\nThe Scripps Research Institute,\nLa Jolla, CA 92037,\nUSA.Since the first reports of a novel pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China there has been considerable discussion and uncertainty over the origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 are now widespread in China, with cases in every province. As of 14 February 2020, 64,473 such cases have been confirmed, with 1,384 deaths attributed to the virus. These official case numbers are likely an underestimate because of limited reporting of mild and asymptomatic cases, and the virus is clearly capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. Based on the possibility of spread to countries with weaker healthcare systems, the World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). There are currently neither vaccines nor specific treatments for this disease.SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the  Coronaviridae  known to infect humans. Three of these viruses, SARS CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, can cause severe disease; four, HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E, are associated with mild respiratory symptoms. Herein, we review what can be deduced about the origin and early evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from the comparative analysis of available genome sequence data. In particular, we offer a perspective on the notable features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and discuss scenarios by which these features could have arisen. Importantly, this analysis provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct nor a purposefully manipulated virus.The genomic comparison of both alpha- and betacoronaviruses (family  Coronaviridae ) described below identifies two notable features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (i) based on structural modelling and early biochemical experiments, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be optimized for binding to the human ACE2 receptor; (ii) the highly variable spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1 and S2 boundary via the insertion of twelve nucleotides. Additionally, this event led to the acquisition of three predicted O-linked glycans around the polybasic cleavage site.The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses is the most variable part of the virus genome. Six residues in the RBD appear to be critical for binding to the human ACE2 receptor and determining host range1. Using coordinates based on the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV, they are Y442, L472, N479, D480, T487, and Y4911. The corresponding residues in SARS-CoV-2 are L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501, and Y505. Five of these six residues are mutated in SARS-CoV-2 compared to its most closely related virus, RaTG13 sampled from a  Rhinolophus affinis  bat, to which it is ~96% identical2 (Figure 1a). Based on modeling1 and biochemical experiments3,4, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have an RBD that may bind with high affinity to ACE2 from human, non-human primate, ferret, pig, and cat, as well as other species with high receptor homology1. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 may bind less efficiently to ACE2 in other species associated with SARS-like viruses, including rodents and civets1.The phenylalanine (F) at residue 486 in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein corresponds to L472 in the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. Notably, in SARS-CoV cell culture experiments the L472 mutates to phenylalanine (L472F)5, which is predicted to be optimal for binding of the SARS-CoV RBD to the human ACE2 receptor6. However, a phenylalanine in this position is also present in several SARS-like CoVs from bats (Figure 1a). While these analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of binding the human ACE2 receptor with high affinity, the interaction is not predicted to be optimal1. Additionally, several of the key residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 are different to those previously described as optimal for human ACE2 receptor binding6. In contrast to these computational predictions, recent binding studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 binds with high affinity to human ACE27. Thus the SARS-CoV-2 spike appears to be the result of selection on human or human-like ACE2 permitting another optimal binding solution to arise. This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is  not  the product of genetic engineering.The second notable feature of SARS-CoV-2 is a predicted polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2, the two subunits of the spike protein (Figure 1b)8,9. In addition to two basic arginines and an alanine at the cleavage site, a leading proline is also inserted; thus, the fully inserted sequence is PRRA (Figure 1b). The strong turn created by the proline insertion is predicted to result in the addition of O-linked glycans to S673, T678, and S686 that flank the polybasic cleavage site. A polybasic cleavage site has not previously been observed in related lineage B betacoronaviruses and is a unique feature of SARS-CoV-2. Some human betacoronaviruses, including HCoV-HKU1 (lineage A), have polybasic cleavage sites, as well as predicted O-linked glycans near the S1/S2 cleavage site.While the functional consequence of the polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, experiments with SARS-CoV have shown that engineering such a site at the S1/S2 junction enhances cell\u2013cell fusion but does not affect virus entry10. Polybasic cleavage sites allow effective cleavage by furin and other proteases, and can be acquired at the junction of the two subunits of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of avian influenza viruses in conditions that select for rapid virus replication and transmission (e.g. highly dense chicken populations). HA serves a similar function in cell-cell fusion and viral entry as the coronavirus S protein. Acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site in HA, by either insertion or recombination, converts low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses into highly pathogenic forms11-13. The acquisition of polybasic cleavage sites by the influenza virus HA has also been observed after repeated forced passage in cell culture or through animals14,15. Similarly, an avirulent isolate of Newcastle Disease virus became highly pathogenic during serial passage in chickens by incremental acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site at the junction of its fusion protein subunits16. The potential function of the three predicted O-linked glycans is less clear, but they could create a \u201cmucin-like domain\u201d that would shield potential epitopes or key residues on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Biochemical analyses or structural studies are required to determine whether or not the predicted O-linked glycan sites are utilized.figure2718\u00d71487 394 KBFigure 1. (a) Mutations in contact residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (top) was aligned against the most closely related SARS-like CoVs and SARS-CoV-1. Key residues in the spike protein that make contact to the ACE2 receptor are marked with blue boxes in both SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. ( b) Acquisition of polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans.  The polybasic cleavage site is marked in grey with the three adjacent predicted O-linked glycans in blue. Both the polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and not previously seen in lineage B betacoronaviruses. Sequences shown are from NCBI GenBank, accession numbers MN908947, MN996532, AY278741, KY417146, MK211376. The pangolin coronavirus sequences are a consensus generated from SRR10168377 and SRR10168378 (NCBI BioProject PRJNA573298)18,19.It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of an existing SARS-related coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for human ACE2 receptor binding with an efficient binding solution different to that which would have been predicted. Further, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one would expect that one of the several reverse genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would have been used. However, this is not the case as the genetic data shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone17. Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in a non-human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage in culture could have given rise to the same observed features.Selection in an animal host. As many of the early cases of COVID-19 were linked to the Huanan seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, it is possible that an animal source was present at this location. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, particularly RaTG13, it is plausible that bats serve as reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2. It is important, however, to note that previous outbreaks of betacoronaviruses in humans involved direct exposure to animals other than bats, including civets (SARS) and camels (MERS), that carry viruses that are genetically very similar to SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, respectively. By analogy, viruses closely related to SARS-Cov-2 may be circulating in one or more animal species. Initial analyses indicate that Malayan pangolins ( Manis javanica ) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain a CoV that is similar to SARS-CoV-218,19. Although the bat virus RaTG13 remains the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 across the whole genome, the Malayan pangolin CoV is identical to SARS-CoV-2 at all six key RBD residues (Figure 1). However, no pangolin CoV has yet been identified that is sufficiently similar to SARS-CoV-2 across its entire genome to support direct human infection. In addition, the pangolin CoV does not carry a polybasic cleavage site insertion. For a precursor virus to acquire the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the spike protein suitable for human ACE2 receptor binding, an animal host would likely have to have a high population density \u2013 to allow natural selection to proceed efficiently \u2013 and an ACE2 gene that is similar to the human orthologue. Further characterization of CoVs in pangolins and other animals that may harbour SARS-CoV-like viruses should be a public health priority.Cryptic adaptation to humans. It is also possible that a progenitor to SARS-CoV-2 jumped from a non-human animal to humans, with the genomic features described above acquired through adaptation during subsequent human-to-human transmission. We surmise that once these adaptations were acquired (either together or in series) it would enable the outbreak to take-off, producing a sufficiently large and unusual cluster of pneumonia cases to trigger the surveillance system that ultimately detected it.All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced so far have the well adapted RBD and the polybasic cleavage site, and are thus derived from a common ancestor that had these features. The presence of an RBD in pangolins that is very similar to the one in SARS-CoV-2 means that this was likely already present in the virus that jumped to humans, even if we don\u2019t yet have the exact non-human progenitor virus. This leaves the polybasic cleavage site insertion to occur during human-to-human transmission. Following the example of the influenza A virus HA gene, a specific insertion or recombination event is required to enable the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as an epidemic pathogen.Estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 using currently available genome sequence data point to virus emergence in late November to early December 201920,21, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases22. Hence, this scenario presumes a period of unrecognised transmission in humans between the initial zoonotic transfer event and the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site. Sufficient opportunity could occur if there had been many prior zoonotic events producing short chains of human-to-human transmission (so-called \u2018stuttering chains\u2019) over an extended period. This is essentially the situation for MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula where all the human cases are the result of repeated jumps of the virus from dromedary camels, producing single infections or short chains of transmission that eventually resolve. To date, after 2,499 cases over 8 years, no human adaptation has emerged that has allowed MERS-CoV to take hold in the human population.How could we test whether cryptic spread of SARS-CoV-2 enabled human adaptation?  Metagenomic studies of banked serum samples could provide important information, but given the relatively short period of viremia it may be impossible to detect low level SARS-CoV-2 circulation in historical samples. Retrospective serological studies potentially could be informative and a few such studies have already been conducted. One found that animal importation traders had a 13% seropositivity to coronaviruses23, while another noted that 3% residents of a village in Southern China were seropositive to these viruses24. Interestingly, 200 residents of Wuhan did not show coronavirus seroreactivity. Critically, however, these studies could not have distinguished whether positive serological responses were due to a prior infection with SARS-CoV-1 or -2. Further retrospective serological studies should be conducted to determine the extent of prior human exposure to betacoronaviruses in different geographic areas, particularly using assays that can distinguish among multiple betacoronaviruses.Selection during passage. Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models have been ongoing in BSL-2 for many years in multiple laboratories across the world25-28. There are also documented instances of the laboratory acquisition of SARS-CoV-1 by laboratory personnel working under BSL-2 containment29,30. We must therefore consider the possibility of a deliberate or inadvertent release of SARS-CoV-2. In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired the observed RBD mutations site during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in studies with SARS-CoV5 as well as MERS-CoV31. However, the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site or O-linked glycans - if functional - argues against this scenario. New polybasic cleavage sites have only been observed after prolonged passaging of low pathogenicity avian influenza virus in cell culture or animals. Furthermore, the generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with a very high genetic similarity. Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required an intense program of passage in cell culture or animals with ACE-2 receptor similar to humans (e.g. ferrets). It is also questionable whether generation of the O-linked glycans would have occurred on cell culture passage, as such mutations typically suggest the involvement of an immune system, that is not present  in vitro .In the midst of the global COVID-19 public health emergency it is reasonable to wonder why the origins of the epidemic matter. A detailed understanding of how an animal virus jumped species boundaries to infect humans so productively will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events. For example, if SARS-CoV-2 pre-adapted in another animal species then we are at risk of future re-emergence events even if the current epidemic is controlled. In contrast, if the adaptive process we describe occurred in humans, then even if we have repeated zoonotic transfers they are unlikely to take-off unless the same series of mutations occurs. In addition, identifying the closest animal relatives of SARS-CoV-2 will greatly assist studies of virus function. Indeed, the availability of the RaTG13 bat sequence facilitated the comparative genomic analysis performed here, helping to reveal the key mutations in the RBD as well as the polybasic cleavage site insertion.The genomic features described here may in part explain the infectiousness and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Although genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here, and it is unclear whether future data will help resolve this issue. Identifying the immediate non-human animal source and obtaining virus sequences from it would be the most definitive way of revealing virus origins. In addition, it would be helpful to obtain more genetic and functional data about the virus, including experimental studies of receptor binding and the role of the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans. The identification of a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the sequencing of very early cases including those not connected to the Wuhan market, would similarly be highly informative. Irrespective of how SARS-CoV-2 originated, the ongoing surveillance of pneumonia in humans and other animals is clearly of utmost importance.We thank all those who have contributed SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and contributed analyses and ideas to Virological.org (http://virological.org/).

I would add, however, that even if two virus isolates have an IDENTICAL amino acid sequence, that would not automatically make one the origin of the other. In my post 10 days ago, Tackling Rumors of a Suspicious Origin of nCoV2019 , I showed that mutations in the 3rd wobble base in an otherwise conserved region accumulate as to make seemingly identical viruses very much separated in time \u2013 indeed over decades.It is time to leave playing \u201cwho\u2019s ur daddy\u201d to daytime television. No known viral RNA sequence is the daddy of SARS-CoV-2. No match. If it doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit. It is all bat guano. Whatever analogy you like. A thrust of distrust and recrimination is not the path to protecting the planet from a viral catastrophe.Bill GallaherMandarin translation thanks to CHEN Guo from the Center for Infection and Immunity in the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health.The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2_ChineseSummary.pdf (198.5 KB)Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled",

Andersen\nDepartment of Immunology and Microbiology,\nThe Scripps Research Institute,\nLa Jolla, CA 92037,\nUSA.Since the first reports of a novel pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China there has been considerable discussion and uncertainty over the origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 are now widespread in China, with cases in every province. As of 14 February 2020, 64,473 such cases have been confirmed, with 1,384 deaths attributed to the virus. These official case numbers are likely an underestimate because of limited reporting of mild and asymptomatic cases, and the virus is clearly capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. Based on the possibility of spread to countries with weaker healthcare systems, the World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). There are currently neither vaccines nor specific treatments for this disease.SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the  Coronaviridae  known to infect humans. Three of these viruses, SARS CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, can cause severe disease; four, HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E, are associated with mild respiratory symptoms. Herein, we review what can be deduced about the origin and early evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from the comparative analysis of available genome sequence data. In particular, we offer a perspective on the notable features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and discuss scenarios by which these features could have arisen. Importantly, this analysis provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct nor a purposefully manipulated virus.The genomic comparison of both alpha- and betacoronaviruses (family  Coronaviridae ) described below identifies two notable features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (i) based on structural modelling and early biochemical experiments, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be optimized for binding to the human ACE2 receptor; (ii) the highly variable spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1 and S2 boundary via the insertion of twelve nucleotides. Additionally, this event led to the acquisition of three predicted O-linked glycans around the polybasic cleavage site.The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses is the most variable part of the virus genome. Six residues in the RBD appear to be critical for binding to the human ACE2 receptor and determining host range1. Using coordinates based on the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV, they are Y442, L472, N479, D480, T487, and Y4911. The corresponding residues in SARS-CoV-2 are L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501, and Y505. Five of these six residues are mutated in SARS-CoV-2 compared to its most closely related virus, RaTG13 sampled from a  Rhinolophus affinis  bat, to which it is ~96% identical2 (Figure 1a). Based on modeling1 and biochemical experiments3,4, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have an RBD that may bind with high affinity to ACE2 from human, non-human primate, ferret, pig, and cat, as well as other species with high receptor homology1. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 may bind less efficiently to ACE2 in other species associated with SARS-like viruses, including rodents and civets1.The phenylalanine (F) at residue 486 in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein corresponds to L472 in the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. Notably, in SARS-CoV cell culture experiments the L472 mutates to phenylalanine (L472F)5, which is predicted to be optimal for binding of the SARS-CoV RBD to the human ACE2 receptor6. However, a phenylalanine in this position is also present in several SARS-like CoVs from bats (Figure 1a). While these analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of binding the human ACE2 receptor with high affinity, the interaction is not predicted to be optimal1. Additionally, several of the key residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 are different to those previously described as optimal for human ACE2 receptor binding6. In contrast to these computational predictions, recent binding studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 binds with high affinity to human ACE27. Thus the SARS-CoV-2 spike appears to be the result of selection on human or human-like ACE2 permitting another optimal binding solution to arise. This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is  not  the product of genetic engineering.The second notable feature of SARS-CoV-2 is a predicted polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2, the two subunits of the spike protein (Figure 1b)8,9. In addition to two basic arginines and an alanine at the cleavage site, a leading proline is also inserted; thus, the fully inserted sequence is PRRA (Figure 1b). The strong turn created by the proline insertion is predicted to result in the addition of O-linked glycans to S673, T678, and S686 that flank the polybasic cleavage site. A polybasic cleavage site has not previously been observed in related lineage B betacoronaviruses and is a unique feature of SARS-CoV-2. Some human betacoronaviruses, including HCoV-HKU1 (lineage A), have polybasic cleavage sites, as well as predicted O-linked glycans near the S1/S2 cleavage site.While the functional consequence of the polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, experiments with SARS-CoV have shown that engineering such a site at the S1/S2 junction enhances cell\u2013cell fusion but does not affect virus entry10. Polybasic cleavage sites allow effective cleavage by furin and other proteases, and can be acquired at the junction of the two subunits of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of avian influenza viruses in conditions that select for rapid virus replication and transmission (e.g. highly dense chicken populations). HA serves a similar function in cell-cell fusion and viral entry as the coronavirus S protein. Acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site in HA, by either insertion or recombination, converts low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses into highly pathogenic forms11-13. The acquisition of polybasic cleavage sites by the influenza virus HA has also been observed after repeated forced passage in cell culture or through animals14,15. Similarly, an avirulent isolate of Newcastle Disease virus became highly pathogenic during serial passage in chickens by incremental acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site at the junction of its fusion protein subunits16. The potential function of the three predicted O-linked glycans is less clear, but they could create a \u201cmucin-like domain\u201d that would shield potential epitopes or key residues on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Biochemical analyses or structural studies are required to determine whether or not the predicted O-linked glycan sites are utilized.figure2718\u00d71487 394 KBFigure 1. (a) Mutations in contact residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (top) was aligned against the most closely related SARS-like CoVs and SARS-CoV-1. Key residues in the spike protein that make contact to the ACE2 receptor are marked with blue boxes in both SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. ( b) Acquisition of polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans.  The polybasic cleavage site is marked in grey with the three adjacent predicted O-linked glycans in blue. Both the polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and not previously seen in lineage B betacoronaviruses. Sequences shown are from NCBI GenBank, accession numbers MN908947, MN996532, AY278741, KY417146, MK211376. The pangolin coronavirus sequences are a consensus generated from SRR10168377 and SRR10168378 (NCBI BioProject PRJNA573298)18,19.It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of an existing SARS-related coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for human ACE2 receptor binding with an efficient binding solution different to that which would have been predicted. Further, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one would expect that one of the several reverse genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would have been used. However, this is not the case as the genetic data shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone17. Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in a non-human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage in culture could have given rise to the same observed features.Selection in an animal host. As many of the early cases of COVID-19 were linked to the Huanan seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, it is possible that an animal source was present at this location. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, particularly RaTG13, it is plausible that bats serve as reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2. It is important, however, to note that previous outbreaks of betacoronaviruses in humans involved direct exposure to animals other than bats, including civets (SARS) and camels (MERS), that carry viruses that are genetically very similar to SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, respectively. By analogy, viruses closely related to SARS-Cov-2 may be circulating in one or more animal species. Initial analyses indicate that Malayan pangolins ( Manis javanica ) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain a CoV that is similar to SARS-CoV-218,19. Although the bat virus RaTG13 remains the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 across the whole genome, the Malayan pangolin CoV is identical to SARS-CoV-2 at all six key RBD residues (Figure 1). However, no pangolin CoV has yet been identified that is sufficiently similar to SARS-CoV-2 across its entire genome to support direct human infection. In addition, the pangolin CoV does not carry a polybasic cleavage site insertion. For a precursor virus to acquire the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the spike protein suitable for human ACE2 receptor binding, an animal host would likely have to have a high population density \u2013 to allow natural selection to proceed efficiently \u2013 and an ACE2 gene that is similar to the human orthologue. Further characterization of CoVs in pangolins and other animals that may harbour SARS-CoV-like viruses should be a public health priority.Cryptic adaptation to humans. It is also possible that a progenitor to SARS-CoV-2 jumped from a non-human animal to humans, with the genomic features described above acquired through adaptation during subsequent human-to-human transmission. We surmise that once these adaptations were acquired (either together or in series) it would enable the outbreak to take-off, producing a sufficiently large and unusual cluster of pneumonia cases to trigger the surveillance system that ultimately detected it.All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced so far have the well adapted RBD and the polybasic cleavage site, and are thus derived from a common ancestor that had these features. The presence of an RBD in pangolins that is very similar to the one in SARS-CoV-2 means that this was likely already present in the virus that jumped to humans, even if we don\u2019t yet have the exact non-human progenitor virus. This leaves the polybasic cleavage site insertion to occur during human-to-human transmission. Following the example of the influenza A virus HA gene, a specific insertion or recombination event is required to enable the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as an epidemic pathogen.Estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 using currently available genome sequence data point to virus emergence in late November to early December 201920,21, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases22. Hence, this scenario presumes a period of unrecognised transmission in humans between the initial zoonotic transfer event and the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site. Sufficient opportunity could occur if there had been many prior zoonotic events producing short chains of human-to-human transmission (so-called \u2018stuttering chains\u2019) over an extended period. This is essentially the situation for MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula where all the human cases are the result of repeated jumps of the virus from dromedary camels, producing single infections or short chains of transmission that eventually resolve. To date, after 2,499 cases over 8 years, no human adaptation has emerged that has allowed MERS-CoV to take hold in the human population.How could we test whether cryptic spread of SARS-CoV-2 enabled human adaptation?  Metagenomic studies of banked serum samples could provide important information, but given the relatively short period of viremia it may be impossible to detect low level SARS-CoV-2 circulation in historical samples. Retrospective serological studies potentially could be informative and a few such studies have already been conducted. One found that animal importation traders had a 13% seropositivity to coronaviruses23, while another noted that 3% residents of a village in Southern China were seropositive to these viruses24. Interestingly, 200 residents of Wuhan did not show coronavirus seroreactivity. Critically, however, these studies could not have distinguished whether positive serological responses were due to a prior infection with SARS-CoV-1 or -2. Further retrospective serological studies should be conducted to determine the extent of prior human exposure to betacoronaviruses in different geographic areas, particularly using assays that can distinguish among multiple betacoronaviruses.Selection during passage. Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models have been ongoing in BSL-2 for many years in multiple laboratories across the world25-28. There are also documented instances of the laboratory acquisition of SARS-CoV-1 by laboratory personnel working under BSL-2 containment29,30. We must therefore consider the possibility of a deliberate or inadvertent release of SARS-CoV-2. In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired the observed RBD mutations site during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in studies with SARS-CoV5 as well as MERS-CoV31. However, the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site or O-linked glycans - if functional - argues against this scenario. New polybasic cleavage sites have only been observed after prolonged passaging of low pathogenicity avian influenza virus in cell culture or animals. Furthermore, the generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with a very high genetic similarity. Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required an intense program of passage in cell culture or animals with ACE-2 receptor similar to humans (e.g. ferrets). It is also questionable whether generation of the O-linked glycans would have occurred on cell culture passage, as such mutations typically suggest the involvement of an immune system, that is not present  in vitro .In the midst of the global COVID-19 public health emergency it is reasonable to wonder why the origins of the epidemic matter. A detailed understanding of how an animal virus jumped species boundaries to infect humans so productively will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events. For example, if SARS-CoV-2 pre-adapted in another animal species then we are at risk of future re-emergence events even if the current epidemic is controlled. In contrast, if the adaptive process we describe occurred in humans, then even if we have repeated zoonotic transfers they are unlikely to take-off unless the same series of mutations occurs. In addition, identifying the closest animal relatives of SARS-CoV-2 will greatly assist studies of virus function. Indeed, the availability of the RaTG13 bat sequence facilitated the comparative genomic analysis performed here, helping to reveal the key mutations in the RBD as well as the polybasic cleavage site insertion.The genomic features described here may in part explain the infectiousness and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Although genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here, and it is unclear whether future data will help resolve this issue. Identifying the immediate non-human animal source and obtaining virus sequences from it would be the most definitive way of revealing virus origins. In addition, it would be helpful to obtain more genetic and functional data about the virus, including experimental studies of receptor binding and the role of the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans. The identification of a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the sequencing of very early cases including those not connected to the Wuhan market, would similarly be highly informative. Irrespective of how SARS-CoV-2 originated, the ongoing surveillance of pneumonia in humans and other animals is clearly of utmost importance.We thank all those who have contributed SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and contributed analyses and ideas to Virological.org (http://virological.org/).

I would add, however, that even if two virus isolates have an IDENTICAL amino acid sequence, that would not automatically make one the origin of the other. In my post 10 days ago, Tackling Rumors of a Suspicious Origin of nCoV2019 , I showed that mutations in the 3rd wobble base in an otherwise conserved region accumulate as to make seemingly identical viruses very much separated in time \u2013 indeed over decades.It is time to leave playing \u201cwho\u2019s ur daddy\u201d to daytime television. No known viral RNA sequence is the daddy of SARS-CoV-2. No match. If it doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit. It is all bat guano. Whatever analogy you like. A thrust of distrust and recrimination is not the path to protecting the planet from a viral catastrophe.Bill GallaherMandarin translation thanks to CHEN Guo from the Center for Infection and Immunity in the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health.The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2_ChineseSummary.pdf (198.5 KB)Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled",

Andersen\nDepartment of Immunology and Microbiology,\nThe Scripps Research Institute,\nLa Jolla, CA 92037,\nUSA.Since the first reports of a novel pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China there has been considerable discussion and uncertainty over the origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 are now widespread in China, with cases in every province. As of 14 February 2020, 64,473 such cases have been confirmed, with 1,384 deaths attributed to the virus. These official case numbers are likely an underestimate because of limited reporting of mild and asymptomatic cases, and the virus is clearly capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. Based on the possibility of spread to countries with weaker healthcare systems, the World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). There are currently neither vaccines nor specific treatments for this disease.SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the  Coronaviridae  known to infect humans. Three of these viruses, SARS CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, can cause severe disease; four, HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E, are associated with mild respiratory symptoms. Herein, we review what can be deduced about the origin and early evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from the comparative analysis of available genome sequence data. In particular, we offer a perspective on the notable features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and discuss scenarios by which these features could have arisen. Importantly, this analysis provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct nor a purposefully manipulated virus.The genomic comparison of both alpha- and betacoronaviruses (family  Coronaviridae ) described below identifies two notable features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (i) based on structural modelling and early biochemical experiments, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be optimized for binding to the human ACE2 receptor; (ii) the highly variable spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1 and S2 boundary via the insertion of twelve nucleotides. Additionally, this event led to the acquisition of three predicted O-linked glycans around the polybasic cleavage site.The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses is the most variable part of the virus genome. Six residues in the RBD appear to be critical for binding to the human ACE2 receptor and determining host range1. Using coordinates based on the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV, they are Y442, L472, N479, D480, T487, and Y4911. The corresponding residues in SARS-CoV-2 are L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501, and Y505. Five of these six residues are mutated in SARS-CoV-2 compared to its most closely related virus, RaTG13 sampled from a  Rhinolophus affinis  bat, to which it is ~96% identical2 (Figure 1a). Based on modeling1 and biochemical experiments3,4, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have an RBD that may bind with high affinity to ACE2 from human, non-human primate, ferret, pig, and cat, as well as other species with high receptor homology1. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 may bind less efficiently to ACE2 in other species associated with SARS-like viruses, including rodents and civets1.The phenylalanine (F) at residue 486 in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein corresponds to L472 in the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. Notably, in SARS-CoV cell culture experiments the L472 mutates to phenylalanine (L472F)5, which is predicted to be optimal for binding of the SARS-CoV RBD to the human ACE2 receptor6. However, a phenylalanine in this position is also present in several SARS-like CoVs from bats (Figure 1a). While these analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of binding the human ACE2 receptor with high affinity, the interaction is not predicted to be optimal1. Additionally, several of the key residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 are different to those previously described as optimal for human ACE2 receptor binding6. In contrast to these computational predictions, recent binding studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 binds with high affinity to human ACE27. Thus the SARS-CoV-2 spike appears to be the result of selection on human or human-like ACE2 permitting another optimal binding solution to arise. This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is  not  the product of genetic engineering.The second notable feature of SARS-CoV-2 is a predicted polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2, the two subunits of the spike protein (Figure 1b)8,9. In addition to two basic arginines and an alanine at the cleavage site, a leading proline is also inserted; thus, the fully inserted sequence is PRRA (Figure 1b). The strong turn created by the proline insertion is predicted to result in the addition of O-linked glycans to S673, T678, and S686 that flank the polybasic cleavage site. A polybasic cleavage site has not previously been observed in related lineage B betacoronaviruses and is a unique feature of SARS-CoV-2. Some human betacoronaviruses, including HCoV-HKU1 (lineage A), have polybasic cleavage sites, as well as predicted O-linked glycans near the S1/S2 cleavage site.While the functional consequence of the polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, experiments with SARS-CoV have shown that engineering such a site at the S1/S2 junction enhances cell\u2013cell fusion but does not affect virus entry10. Polybasic cleavage sites allow effective cleavage by furin and other proteases, and can be acquired at the junction of the two subunits of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of avian influenza viruses in conditions that select for rapid virus replication and transmission (e.g. highly dense chicken populations). HA serves a similar function in cell-cell fusion and viral entry as the coronavirus S protein. Acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site in HA, by either insertion or recombination, converts low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses into highly pathogenic forms11-13. The acquisition of polybasic cleavage sites by the influenza virus HA has also been observed after repeated forced passage in cell culture or through animals14,15. Similarly, an avirulent isolate of Newcastle Disease virus became highly pathogenic during serial passage in chickens by incremental acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site at the junction of its fusion protein subunits16. The potential function of the three predicted O-linked glycans is less clear, but they could create a \u201cmucin-like domain\u201d that would shield potential epitopes or key residues on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Biochemical analyses or structural studies are required to determine whether or not the predicted O-linked glycan sites are utilized.figure2718\u00d71487 394 KBFigure 1. (a) Mutations in contact residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (top) was aligned against the most closely related SARS-like CoVs and SARS-CoV-1. Key residues in the spike protein that make contact to the ACE2 receptor are marked with blue boxes in both SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. ( b) Acquisition of polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans.  The polybasic cleavage site is marked in grey with the three adjacent predicted O-linked glycans in blue. Both the polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and not previously seen in lineage B betacoronaviruses. Sequences shown are from NCBI GenBank, accession numbers MN908947, MN996532, AY278741, KY417146, MK211376. The pangolin coronavirus sequences are a consensus generated from SRR10168377 and SRR10168378 (NCBI BioProject PRJNA573298)18,19.It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of an existing SARS-related coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for human ACE2 receptor binding with an efficient binding solution different to that which would have been predicted. Further, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one would expect that one of the several reverse genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would have been used. However, this is not the case as the genetic data shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone17. Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in a non-human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage in culture could have given rise to the same observed features.Selection in an animal host. As many of the early cases of COVID-19 were linked to the Huanan seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, it is possible that an animal source was present at this location. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, particularly RaTG13, it is plausible that bats serve as reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2. It is important, however, to note that previous outbreaks of betacoronaviruses in humans involved direct exposure to animals other than bats, including civets (SARS) and camels (MERS), that carry viruses that are genetically very similar to SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, respectively. By analogy, viruses closely related to SARS-Cov-2 may be circulating in one or more animal species. Initial analyses indicate that Malayan pangolins ( Manis javanica ) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain a CoV that is similar to SARS-CoV-218,19. Although the bat virus RaTG13 remains the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 across the whole genome, the Malayan pangolin CoV is identical to SARS-CoV-2 at all six key RBD residues (Figure 1). However, no pangolin CoV has yet been identified that is sufficiently similar to SARS-CoV-2 across its entire genome to support direct human infection. In addition, the pangolin CoV does not carry a polybasic cleavage site insertion. For a precursor virus to acquire the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the spike protein suitable for human ACE2 receptor binding, an animal host would likely have to have a high population density \u2013 to allow natural selection to proceed efficiently \u2013 and an ACE2 gene that is similar to the human orthologue. Further characterization of CoVs in pangolins and other animals that may harbour SARS-CoV-like viruses should be a public health priority.Cryptic adaptation to humans. It is also possible that a progenitor to SARS-CoV-2 jumped from a non-human animal to humans, with the genomic features described above acquired through adaptation during subsequent human-to-human transmission. We surmise that once these adaptations were acquired (either together or in series) it would enable the outbreak to take-off, producing a sufficiently large and unusual cluster of pneumonia cases to trigger the surveillance system that ultimately detected it.All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced so far have the well adapted RBD and the polybasic cleavage site, and are thus derived from a common ancestor that had these features. The presence of an RBD in pangolins that is very similar to the one in SARS-CoV-2 means that this was likely already present in the virus that jumped to humans, even if we don\u2019t yet have the exact non-human progenitor virus. This leaves the polybasic cleavage site insertion to occur during human-to-human transmission. Following the example of the influenza A virus HA gene, a specific insertion or recombination event is required to enable the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as an epidemic pathogen.Estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 using currently available genome sequence data point to virus emergence in late November to early December 201920,21, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases22. Hence, this scenario presumes a period of unrecognised transmission in humans between the initial zoonotic transfer event and the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site. Sufficient opportunity could occur if there had been many prior zoonotic events producing short chains of human-to-human transmission (so-called \u2018stuttering chains\u2019) over an extended period. This is essentially the situation for MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula where all the human cases are the result of repeated jumps of the virus from dromedary camels, producing single infections or short chains of transmission that eventually resolve. To date, after 2,499 cases over 8 years, no human adaptation has emerged that has allowed MERS-CoV to take hold in the human population.How could we test whether cryptic spread of SARS-CoV-2 enabled human adaptation?  Metagenomic studies of banked serum samples could provide important information, but given the relatively short period of viremia it may be impossible to detect low level SARS-CoV-2 circulation in historical samples. Retrospective serological studies potentially could be informative and a few such studies have already been conducted. One found that animal importation traders had a 13% seropositivity to coronaviruses23, while another noted that 3% residents of a village in Southern China were seropositive to these viruses24. Interestingly, 200 residents of Wuhan did not show coronavirus seroreactivity. Critically, however, these studies could not have distinguished whether positive serological responses were due to a prior infection with SARS-CoV-1 or -2. Further retrospective serological studies should be conducted to determine the extent of prior human exposure to betacoronaviruses in different geographic areas, particularly using assays that can distinguish among multiple betacoronaviruses.Selection during passage. Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models have been ongoing in BSL-2 for many years in multiple laboratories across the world25-28. There are also documented instances of the laboratory acquisition of SARS-CoV-1 by laboratory personnel working under BSL-2 containment29,30. We must therefore consider the possibility of a deliberate or inadvertent release of SARS-CoV-2. In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired the observed RBD mutations site during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in studies with SARS-CoV5 as well as MERS-CoV31. However, the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site or O-linked glycans - if functional - argues against this scenario. New polybasic cleavage sites have only been observed after prolonged passaging of low pathogenicity avian influenza virus in cell culture or animals. Furthermore, the generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with a very high genetic similarity. Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required an intense program of passage in cell culture or animals with ACE-2 receptor similar to humans (e.g. ferrets). It is also questionable whether generation of the O-linked glycans would have occurred on cell culture passage, as such mutations typically suggest the involvement of an immune system, that is not present  in vitro .In the midst of the global COVID-19 public health emergency it is reasonable to wonder why the origins of the epidemic matter. A detailed understanding of how an animal virus jumped species boundaries to infect humans so productively will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events. For example, if SARS-CoV-2 pre-adapted in another animal species then we are at risk of future re-emergence events even if the current epidemic is controlled. In contrast, if the adaptive process we describe occurred in humans, then even if we have repeated zoonotic transfers they are unlikely to take-off unless the same series of mutations occurs. In addition, identifying the closest animal relatives of SARS-CoV-2 will greatly assist studies of virus function. Indeed, the availability of the RaTG13 bat sequence facilitated the comparative genomic analysis performed here, helping to reveal the key mutations in the RBD as well as the polybasic cleavage site insertion.The genomic features described here may in part explain the infectiousness and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Although genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here, and it is unclear whether future data will help resolve this issue. Identifying the immediate non-human animal source and obtaining virus sequences from it would be the most definitive way of revealing virus origins. In addition, it would be helpful to obtain more genetic and functional data about the virus, including experimental studies of receptor binding and the role of the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans. The identification of a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the sequencing of very early cases including those not connected to the Wuhan market, would similarly be highly informative. Irrespective of how SARS-CoV-2 originated, the ongoing surveillance of pneumonia in humans and other animals is clearly of utmost importance.We thank all those who have contributed SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and contributed analyses and ideas to Virological.org (http://virological.org/).

I would add, however, that even if two virus isolates have an IDENTICAL amino acid sequence, that would not automatically make one the origin of the other. In my post 10 days ago, Tackling Rumors of a Suspicious Origin of nCoV2019 , I showed that mutations in the 3rd wobble base in an otherwise conserved region accumulate as to make seemingly identical viruses very much separated in time \u2013 indeed over decades.It is time to leave playing \u201cwho\u2019s ur daddy\u201d to daytime television. No known viral RNA sequence is the daddy of SARS-CoV-2. No match. If it doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit. It is all bat guano. Whatever analogy you like. A thrust of distrust and recrimination is not the path to protecting the planet from a viral catastrophe.Bill GallaherMandarin translation thanks to CHEN Guo from the Center for Infection and Immunity in the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health.The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2_ChineseSummary.pdf (198.5 KB)Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled",

            "headline": "Early epidemiological assessment of the transmission potential and virulence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City: China, January-February, 2020",
            "main_text": "Background: \nSince the first cluster of cases was identified in Wuhan City, China, in December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across China, causing multiple introductions in 109 countries/territories/areas as of March 10th. Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently more evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of this emerging disease. In this study, we derive estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources.\nMethods: \nWe employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For this purpose, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were integrated into our analysis.\nResults: \nOur posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China in 2019-2020 reached values as high as 5.20 (95%CrI: 5.04-5.47) and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23rd in 2020 was associated with a declined R at 0.58 (95%CrI: 0.51-0.64), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 1905526 (95%CrI: 1350283-2655936) in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 19.1% (95%CrI: 13.5-26.6%). We also found that most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be 0.04% (95% CrI: 0.03-0.06%) and 0.12% (95%CrI: 0.08-0.17%), which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR estimated at 4.19%\nConclusions: \nWe have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China during January-February, 2020 using an ecological modelling approach. The power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems.The authors have declared no competing interest.KM acknowledges support from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grant Number 18K17368 and from the Leading Initiative for Excellent Young Researchers from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science & Technology of Japan.

The examination dates will also be adjusted accordingly.As of February 15, all 63 provinces and cities in Vietnam have extended their school closing time, 56 of which \u2014 including Saigon \u2014 have announced that schools will be closed until the end of February, according to the news source.Amidst the worrying spread of Covid-19, the Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s People Committee is also proposing to the central government and the education and training ministry to let students stay at home until the end of March. The proposed second term of the academic year will then start instead in April and end in July this year. The new academic term will start in September and the summer holiday will be shortened to one month.The HCMC Department of Education and Training has also sent a dispatch encouraging schools and universities to change their teaching methods to ones that stimulate self-learning and research.While most schools and parents agree on closing schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic, long breaks have taken a toll on parents, especially factory workers who have small children.

            "main_text": "Summary:Death toll passes 2,000 as Hubei reports 132 deaths for TuesdayJapan to release first wave of 500 passengers + crew at 10:30 am in TokyoFlorida health officials mysteriously refuse to share virus info with reportersRussia bars all Chinese from enteringNYT notes signs of impending economic distressSouth Korea announces \"emergency steps\" to prepare for outbreak.South Korea announces 15 new cases* * *Update (1940ET): It's Wednesday morning in Yokohama. So you know what that means.Japanese health authorities are beginning the process of offloading the remaining 2,000+ passengers and crew aboard the 'Diamond Princess', a ship that has been under quarantine for 14 days.The offloading will take place in phases over three days, finally wrapping up on Friday. The first 500 people are set to leave at around 10:30 am Tokyo time on Wednesday. There will be no preference given to different nationalities, according to Japan's Ministry of Health.Many who depart will be subject to another 14 days of quarantine, including any Americans who elected to stay on the ship instead of traveling back to the US on the evac flight. Roughly 40 Americans were also excluded from that flight because they were being treated for the virus in a Japanese hospital.So far, 542 people - including at least 14 of the 300 or so Americans who traveled back to the US on Monday in Japan - have tested positive for the virus. And while Japan says it has tested everybody aboard, doctors and experts say there's no way to certain that people being released won't be carrying the virus - hence the quarantines when they return home.But where will they go between now and then? And with no immediate after-care plans - at least none that have been publicly disclosed, it looks like Japan is about to set thousands of people aboard the most infected environment outside China loose in Tokyo.Of course, Japanese authorities are so paranoid about the Olympics, one would think they would be doing everything in their power to stop an outbreak in Tokyo, especially at such a sensitive time.About 500 people are set to leave the ship from around 10:30 a.m. Tokyo time on Wednesday, with no preference given to any particular nationality, Japan\u2019s Health Ministry said.Hopefully, health officials will manage to convince the world that they successfully screened for the virus.The ship was first quarantined on Feb. 5 more than a week after a man who tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong disembarked. Journalists have shared stories of desperation and paranoia from those trapped on the ship, making it sound like such a nightmare that many who read those stories may never want to travel on a cruise.In other news, Yonhap reported minutes ago that South Korea has another 15 cases, increasing the countries total by roughly one-third to 46 one day after the country's president warned of an \"economic emergency\" as companies like Hyundai suffer from supply shortages from China. The South Korean government has already announced a fiscal stimulus package to help companies hurt by the virus.* * *Update (1720ET): Health officials in Hubei reported a big jump in deaths on Tuesday, shattering the state's narrative that the virus is being beaten because the number of confirmed cases and deaths were falling.And with the new figures, the China death toll has hit 2,000 exactly, up from 1,868 deaths as of the end of Monday, according to China's NHC.Meanwhile, state officials in Florida are refusing to release any information about the state's efforts to contain a coronavirus outbreak, including data about the number of patients who have been tested for the virus, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\"The goal of this public health response is containment,\" said state Surgeon General Scott Rivkees, who presented to the Senate Health Policy committee Tuesday. \"And if there\u2019s a confirmed case, it will absolutely be reported.\"Rivkees added that the state wasn't allowed to release the information because of \"privacy concerns\" - likely a rule about patient confidentiality codified in the federal HIPPA guidelines.However, veteran journalists in the state pressed the surgeon general: These numbers were shared with the public during Zika, and since the numbers don't include any personalized details, there shouldn't be any conflict with HIPPA.Despite their protests, the state simply deferred to the Department of Health, which has created a 700-person incident management team to liaise with states and help the country prepare for the potential outbreak. Certain protocols have been shared with officials in every state.Though if not sharing this information is part of some kind of federal 'protocol', then how come Washington State is sharing some of this information directly on a Department of Public Health website?Also in the US: the CDC said earlier that the State Department is planning to bar any Americans who were aboard the Diamond Princess but didn't return with the evacuees from returning to the country until next month.* * *Update (1600ET): Writing in the latest update to its coronavirus live blog, the New York Times points out that more signs of economic pain from the outbreak have emerged on Tuesday. It cites HSBC's bloodletting, Jaguar's warning about looming production problems and Apple's latest production warning as worrying signs of corporate blowback even as the Nasdaq closed at a record high.Economic fallout from the new coronavirus epidemic continued to spread on Tuesday, with new evidence emerging in manufacturing, financial markets, commodities, banking and other sectors.HSBC, one of the most important banks in Hong Kong, said it plans to cut 35,000 jobs and $4.5 billion in costs as it faces headwinds that include the coronavirus outbreak and months of political strife in Hong Kong. The bank, based in London, had come to depend increasingly on China for growth.Jaguar Land Rover warned that the coronavirus could soon begin to create production problems at its assembly plants in Britain. Like many carmakers, Jaguar Land Rover uses parts made in China, where many factories have shut down or slowed production; Fiat Chrysler, Renault and Hyundai have already reported interruptions as a result.U.S. stocks declined on Tuesday, a day after Apple warned that it would miss its sales forecasts due to disruption in China, as concerns about the impact of the outbreak weighed on the outlook for the global economy.Stocks tied to the near-term ups and downs of the economy slumped, with energy, financials and industrial shares the leading losers. The S&P 500 index was down 0.5 percent at midafternoon in New York trading.Bond yields declined, with the 10-year Treasury note yielding 1.55 percent, suggesting\u00a0 investors are lowering their expectations for economic growth and inflation. With much of the Chinese economy stalled, demand for oil has fallen and prices were down on Tuesday, with a barrel of West Texas Intermediate selling for roughly $52.In Germany, where the economy depends heavily on global demand for machinery and automobiles, a key indicator showed economic sentiment has tumbled this month, as the economic outlook has weakened.You know it's bad when CNBC's unspoken economics 'Word of the Day' is 'one-off'.Meanwhile, America's 'paper of record' reported that at least 150 million people in China are living under severe lockdown restrictions confining them largely to their homes. That's one-tenth of China's population, and 1% of the global population.Kind of hard to work and consume when you can't leave the house.* * *Update (1410ET): In an interview with Fox News, the CDC's Dr. Anthony Fauci said the risk to Americans of contracting COVID-19 is relatively low right now, but that \"could change\" given the chaotic and unpredictable situation.\"The risk clearly is relatively low right now, but that could change. So we're telling our American citizens to not be fearful, to not be afraid, but to keep an eye on it.\"Dr. Fauci added that the federal government has quarantined every known case of the virus.\"The people in this country that were aware of being infected they've been contacted, isolated and made aware that this is the case.\"Just in case any get through, the US is starting 'sentinel surveillance' of patients around the country who go to the hospital to report flu-like symptoms, as we reported yesterday.\"That will give us a better idea of whether there are any cases that we haven't identified or noticed,\" the doctor added.Watch the clip below:THE HEADLINER: Dr. Anthony Fauci discusses the latest in the coronavirus outbreak #nine2noon pic.twitter.com/BLePf1Olyw* * *Update (1300ET): In a landmark decision, Russia has temporarily banned Chinese from entry as of Feb. 20, becoming the first country to ban all Chinese from entry in response to the coronavirus outbreak, according to Russian news agency TASS.This is only the latest step from Russia, which has already closed most entry points along its 4,200-kilometer border, suspended e-visas and work visas for Chinese nationals.Russia has already reported two cases of coronavirus - the only cases confirmed in the country so far - both involving Chinese nationals.Though there haven't been many cases, there have been a number of interesting virus-related headlines out of Russia in recent weeks. Two men in the city of Chelyabinsk were fined for hooliganism after they filmed a prank video where they pretended to shoot a man infected with the virus in a park. The men wore white hazmat suits and face masks while simulating the shooting of the third person, who wasn't actually infected.\u2014 Russia discharged a Chinese national from the hospital in the Siberian city of Chita on Wednesday after he recovered from a coronavirus infection, the second of Russia's two confirmed cases of coronavirus to recover. The other victim, also a Chinese national, was also said by authorities to have recovered and been released from quarantine in Siberia's Tyumen region.Meanwhile,apropos of nothing, BNO News shared one of the latest videos out of Hubei Province, which we'd like to now share with you.Video from Hubei province shows doctors running across the street to take patients who are critically ill with coronavirus to a new ICU unit. It took 30 minutes per patient, 10 in total - Xinhua pic.twitter.com/16XLrYzB8lThis could be an Olympic Sport (if they don't cancel the Olympics, that is).As a handful of brave foreign correspondents continue to report on the outbreak inside mainland China, the Epoch Times' reporter Jennifer Zeng revealed on Tuesday that 71 people from one workplace in Beijing have been placed under quarantine after one employee was infected by COVID-19.We're glad to see China's shift back to work is going so well.* * *Update (0840ET): Global Times editor Hu Xijin, a government mouthpiece whose tweets were closely followed during the 'Phase 1' trade-deal negotiations, is touting China's dubious data as a sign that the Communist Party is winning the 'People's War' against COVID-19.Daily new infection cases outside Hubei fell below 100 for the first time according to data released on Tuesday. We are on the way to the victory. People are in a better mood and cities are recovering the vitality. I myself is also very happy. pic.twitter.com/nTlxIhOwF4* * *Last night, the western press exposed the Americans for breaking Japan's quarantine on the 'Diamond Princess' by ferrying some 14 infected individuals to the US. But with one day left to go before the Japanese government ends its quarantine and releases thousands of terrified and paranoid passengers into the streets of Tokyo.On Tuesday, another 88 passengers from the Diamond Princess were diagnosed with the virus, bringing the total to 542.#BREAKING: Another 88 confirmed new #coronavirus cases from on board the Diamond Princess @abcnews pic.twitter.com/Ixp1XdpY0xJapan has completed tests for all passengers and crew aboard the ship as of Monday, but the results for the last batch of tests aren't expected until Wednesday, the day that the quarantine is slated to end. So far, results are back for 2,404 passengers and crew, out of the 3,711 who were\u00a0 on board the ship when the quarantine began on Feb. 5.Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said Tuesday that people who have tested negative for the virus would start leaving on Wednesday, but that the process of releasing passengers and crew won't be finished until Friday, according to the Washington Post.The remaining 61 American passengers on the DP who opted not to join the evacuation will not be allowed to return to the US until March 4, according to the American embassy in Tokyo. The governments of Australia, Hong Kong and Canada have also said they would evacuate passengers.Elsewhere, Japan confirmed three more cases of the virus. This time, they were confirmed in Wakayama, a prefecture in eastern Japan.In the latest indication that the 14-day quarantine simply wasn't enough to kill the virus, a British couple has tested positive for the virus just one day before Japanese authorities are set to release everybody from quarantine, according to the Guardian.\"David and Sally Abel, a British couple onboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan, have tested positive for coronavirus, a day before passengers who tested negative were due to start leaving the ship after spending two weeks in quarantine.\"Including all of the cases announced overnight, there are now 73,336 confirmed cases of the virus worldwide, compared with 1,874 deaths.Johns HopkinsAs the battle against the virus rages in Wuhan, Liu Zhiming, 51, a neurosurgeon and the director of the Wuchang Hospital in Wuhan, became the latest high-profile medical worker to succumb to the virus, as we noted last night. Late last week, China confirmed that nearly 2,000 medical workers had been infected.The Commission overseeing China's virus response has released a statement commemorating Liu's life and honoring his death.\"From the start of the outbreak, Comrade Liu Zhiming, without regard to his personal safety, led the medical staff of Wuchang Hospital at the front lines of the fight against the epidemic,\" the commission said. Dr. Liu \"made significant contributions to our city\u2019s fight to prevent and control the novel coronavirus,\" it added.In Beijing, senior officials including President Xi continued to play down the economic blowback from the virus. During remarks on Tuesday, Xi insisted that China could still meet its 2020 economic targets - which called for a doubling of the size of the Chinese economy in 10 years - despite the outbreak.We cross live to the Chinese Statistics Bureau as President Xi says China can still meet 2020 economic targets despite coronavirus pic.twitter.com/JJeqvbWJCZOf course, China' goalseeked economic data has never offered a truly accurate reflection of the world's second-largest economy. And a report by PitchBook warns that Chinese startups are struggling to raise money as the epidemic complicates deal talks an deals a serious blow to the country's 'venture capital' scene.From the start of the year through Feb. 12, venture capital activity in China fell from 381 to 137 deals, and the capital raised declined from $4.05 billion to $1.37 billion, compared to the same period last year.Prior outbreaks like SARS and swine flu also weighed on investment activity.Moving south to Seoul, South Korean President Moon Jae-in called for South Korea to take \"emergency steps\" to prepare for a more widespread outbreak of COVID-19.In contrast to Xi, Moon warned the coronavirus could have a \"bigger and longer-lasting impact\" on his country's economy than the 2015 MERS outbreak, which prompted South Korea to roll out a supplemental budget while the central bank cut rates, WaPo reports. Speculators are now betting on a rate cut at the Bank of Korea's meeting next week. Singapore also announced on Tuesday that it had earmarked $2.8 billion for virus relief measures to help stabilize its economy and assist workers.Over in the Philippines, 25,000 stranded workers can now return to work.French Health Minister Olivier Veran said Tuesday there was a \"credible risk\" that the virus could transform into a pandemic, Reuters reports.\"This is both a working assumption and a credible risk,\" Veran told France Info radio, when asked about the possibility of the coronavirus spreading globally.Taking a brief break from the news, our disturbing video of the day comes from Xinjiang, the far-flung province that's home to millions of Uyghur Muslims.In this video, shared by the Epoch Times' Jennifer Zeng, a police officer suddenly collapses while walking. His current status is unknown.Zhou Shunxin, a police officer in #Xinjiang, suddenly collaspes while walking.

Authorities are tracking down people with symptoms of fever or those who bought fever and cough medicines since January 20. #COVID2019 #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/6hwEYzymtMAs we reported last night, Apple published a press release admitting it \"does not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided for the March quarter\" due to coronavirus-related issues.Since we haven't reported a full breakdown of cases in a while, here's a complete list and breakdown of infections by country and territory, courtesy of the AP:Mainland China: 1,868 deaths among 72,436 cases, chiefly in Hubei\nHong Kong: 58 cases, 1 death\nMacao: 10\nJapan: 607 cases, including 542 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, 1 death\nSingapore: 77 cases\nThailand: 35\nSouth Korea: 31\nMalaysia: 22\nTaiwan: 22 cases, 1 death\nVietnam: 16 cases\nGermany: 16\nUnited States: 15 cases; separately, 1 US citizen died in China\nAustralia: 14 cases\nFrance: 12 cases, 1 death\nUnited Kingdom: 9 cases\nUnited Arab Emirates: 9\nCanada: 8\nPhilippines: 3 cases, 1 death\nIndia: 3 cases\nItaly: 3\nRussia: 2\nSpain: 2\nBelgium: 1\nNepal: 1\nSri Lanka: 1\nSweden: 1\nCambodia: 1\nFinland: 1\nEgypt: 1In a recent study, China's CCDC found that the virus's fatality rate - 14.8% - is for people aged 80 or older with co-occurring medical conditions. Young and healthy people, meanwhile, typically experience much more mild symptoms, according to the BBC. Along those same lines, the WHO confirmed on Tuesday that the virus manifests as only a minor infection in four out of five people who contract it, according to the Guardian.For everybody still saying that the virus is no more dangerous than the annual flu outbreak, here's some food for thought: An analysis of 44,672 coronavirus patients in China whose diagnoses were confirmed by laboratory testing has found that 1,023 had died by Feb. 11, a fatality rate of 2.3%. That's far higher than the mortality rate for the seasonal flu.Finally, the New York Times has reviewed lockdown conditions across China, and confirmed that more than 760 million people are living in neighborhoods or villages with at least some imposed strictures regulating residents' comings and goings. That represents half of China's population, and one out of every ten people on the planet.Some neighborhoods only require residents to show ID, sign in and have their temperature checked. Other villages prohibit bringing in guests. In places with more stringent restrictions, households are only allowed to send one person out at a time - and often not even every day.Last night, Zeng reported that in some parts of Wuhan the lockdown has become so strict that people aren't allowed to come outside at all.The locking down in #Wuhan is getting tighter. No coming out at all now. #\u6b66\u6c49 \u5c0f\u533a\u5c01\u9501\u52a0\u5267\u3002\u4ece\u4e03\u5929\u53ef\u51fa\u4e00\u6b21\u95e8\u53d8\u4e3a\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u5019\u4e0d\u5f97\u51fa\u95e8\u3002#COVID2019 #Coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #coronaviruschina #\u6b66\u6c49\u80ba\u708e #\u65b0\u51a0\u80ba\u708e #\u65b0\u51a0\u75c5\u6bd2 #\u5c11\u5e74\u8bd1\u5236 pic.twitter.com/kpbNgZAAjjTips: tips@zerohedge.comGeneral: info@zerohedge.comLegal: legal@zerohedge.comAdvertising: Click hereAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.comMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black Helicopters]\" GuideIt would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer, our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure.
