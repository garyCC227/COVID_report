While, currently, many of these infections are confined to the tropics, global warming, the spread of some mosquito vectors northward, and emergence of temperate-tolerant pathogens such as West Nile virus mean that these problems are increasingly affecting the global north as well. After discussing mosquito-based preventions for the zoonotic infections mentioned in this article, a review of herbal responses to the SARS and MERS epidemics are highlighted. Houttuynia cordata (houttuynia, y\u00fa x\u012bng c\u01ceo) and Glycyrrhiza spp. (licorice) stand out as particularly interesting single herbs for addressing these coronavirus infections. Herbal approaches to flavivirus infections, most notably clinical trials of Carica papaya (papaya) leaves for treating dengue fever, are reviewed. A discussion of many of the extensive range of herbs studied to treat flaviviruses in preclinical studies is provided. Potential herbal treatments for alphavirus infections are then presented.",

(2017) Sunspot Cycle Minima and Pandemics: The Case\nfor Vigilance? Astrobiol Outreach 5: 159. doi:10.4172/2332-2519.1000159\nAbstract\nDirect records of sunspots and the solar cycle have been maintained in astronomical observatories for about\n1610 AD, while indirect records derived from 14C analysis of ice cores go back to about 900 AD. Minima in the\nsunspot cycle present conditions conducive to the entry or activation of new pathogens and also for mutations of\nalready circulating bacteria and viruses. Three grand minima of solar activity on record\u2013the Sporer minimum\n(1450-1550 AD), Maunder minimum (1650-1700 AD) and the Dalton minimum (1800-1830) have all been marked by\na preponderance of pandemics\u2013Small Pox, English Sweats, Plague and Cholera. The sunspot numbers recorded\nfor the present period 2002-2017 include the deepest sunspot minimum (Cycle 23-24) since records began, and a\ntrend to declining numbers throughout the cycle. The same period has seen the resurgence of several pandemics\u2013\nSARS, MERS, Zika, Ebola, Influenza A. We consider it prudent to take note of these facts whilst planning future\nstrategies for pandemic surveillance and control.",
