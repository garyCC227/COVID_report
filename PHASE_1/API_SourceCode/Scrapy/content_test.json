        "content": "New York State is ready to start testing for potential cases of the novel coronavirus, joining New Jersey and Connecticut, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday.The news came hours before New York City health officials announced the results of the latest possible COVID-19 case in the city. The eighth person tested in New York City by the CDC does not have novel coronavirus, city health officials said Saturday afternoon.As of Friday, New York still didn't have permission from the Centers for Disease Control to begin testing, but Cuomo on Saturday morning said his office \"just received word that our test has been approved by the FDA.\"New York State\u2019s Wadsworth Lab will begin testing immediately.\"When I spoke to Vice President [Mike] Pence, I urged him to approve New York State's coronavirus test \u2014 we just received word that our test has been approved by the FDA,\" Cuomo said in a statement. \"This will expedite wait time and improve NY's ability to more effectively manage the coronavirus situation as it unfolds.\"\"New York State's Wadsworth Lab will begin testing immediately,\" he added.Top news stories in the tri-state area, in America and around the worldThe patient tested over the weekend was a New York City resident who recently came back from a trip to Italy, according to officials. The patient's sample was sent to Atlanta for testing, before New York had received its approval.The patient began exhibiting symptoms shortly after returning from a trip to Italy, where NBC News confirmed there are nearly 900 people infected, in addition to 21 deaths. Symptoms \u2014 which include fever, coughing and shortness of breath \u2014 are likely to appear as soon as two days after exposure, or up to two weeks later, according to the CDC.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio sounded off on Twitter over the testing delays, pointing the finger at the Trump administration for not heeding warnings sooner.\"We've gotten every conceivable warning about the coronavirus from health authorities across the country and globe. It\u2019s been coming like a freight train and the Trump administration hasn\u2019t even done the basics,\" the mayor said in a tweet.Meanwhile, the New Jersey Public Health Department said Friday that a lab in West Trenton had been approved to test for the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont also said that a state lab will be able to conduct testing shortly.In a teleconference, the CDC said the goal is to have testing available in all 50 states by the end of next week. When presses about which states and places have the capacity, the CDC would not give specifics citing the evolving situation.We are currently investigating one person in New York City for #COVID19, the illness caused by novel #coronavirus. The person reported symptoms and recent travel to Italy. This person will be tested by @CDCgov and we will update results soon. The latest: https://t.co/AKpJIDztv1 pic.twitter.com/7JzEngSkqpSo far in the tri-state, there have been no confirmed cases of the illness that has now been found on every continent except Antarctica. NYC Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot says that due to the federal government expanding its criteria for virus testing to include Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea, more people are expected to be tested.\"Viruses don\u2019t respect borders and this broader definition will help us cast a wider net to detect the virus. We expect the number of cases under investigation to grow,\" Barbot said.New York City's Bellevue Hospital is one of several local medical centers that are preparing for a possible outbreak. It is home to 1,200 beds that could be readily available in case the virus becomes widespread, according to Mayor de Blasio.We ask New Yorkers to continue to wash their hands regularly and stay home if they feel sick and have recently traveled or been in close contact with someone who has traveled to these or any countries with ongoing person-to-person spread of COVID-19: https://t.co/Cb8O3dXUFhAs of Friday night, there were at least two cases of novel coronavirus in the United States believed to have been transmitted to a person who didn\u2019t travel internationally or come in close contact with anyone who had it.That first patient, a woman in California, was put in isolation and on a ventilator at UC Davis Medical Center. She did not have any contact with any people who are known to be infected, either. Her testing was initially delayed for days because she didn't meet federal criteria.Previously, there were more than 60 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the U.S., most of which stemmed from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.While health experts maintain that the risk of getting the COVID-19 virus is low, spread of the illness is inevitable.",

Brian Kemp announced during a late-night press conference Monday.\u00a0Both patients live\u00a0together and one recently returned from Italy.Governor Brian Kemp during a late-night press conference announced two cases of the coronavirus in GeorgiaGeorgia Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey\u00a0said the patients live\u00a0in Fulton County and contacted their doctor once one of them\u00a0returned and felt sick. Because of their travel history, they had contacted their doctor and\u00a0arranged to meet the doctor without putting the general public at risk. Dr. Toomey said because of the precautions the two patients took, the risk of it spreading among the community is low.Dr. Toomey\u00a0said their symptoms are minimal and neither have not been hospitalized, but are staying isolated in the home with other relatives.Health officials are working to identify others who may have been exposed. Those people will be contacted and monitored for fever and respiratory issues for the next few weeks.SEE ALSO:\u00a0Gov. Kemp names state coronavirus task forceGov. Kemp said he spoke with Vice President Mike Pence, who was put in charge of the federal coronavirus response last week, about the cases just prior to his publically making the announcement.Doctors address the risk of contracting coronavirusAdvertisement\u201cOur team has been working around the clock to prepare for any scenario. Already, state health officials have established contact with these individuals to gather more information, monitor their condition, and determine any exposure,\u201d said Gov.\u00a0Kemp. \u201cThey are confident that our efforts to prepare for this moment have enabled us to manage these cases appropriately and minimize any risks moving forward. We remain in constant communication with our partners at all levels of government, and we will continue to update members of the public as information becomes available.\u201d\u201cWe knew that Georgia would likely have confirmed cases of COVID-19, and we planned for it. The immediate risk of COVID-19 to the general public, however, remains low at this time,\u201d said Dr. Toomey. \u201cI cannot emphasize enough the need for all Georgians to follow the simple precautions that DPH always urges to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses.\u201dDr. Toomey said the virus is spread through the air, especially through coughs and sneezes. Symptoms will become apparent within 14 days of exposure. Those include fever, cough, runny nose, and difficulty breathing.Health officials say, in addition to everyday health precautions, it is important to get a flu shot right now to prevent a weakening of the immune system and to help doctors rule it out when making a diagnosis.The latest on the outbreak of the coronavirus across the United StatesThe death toll from the coronavirus in the U.S. climbed to six Monday and the disease spread to ever more countries and world capitals, even as new cases in China dropped to their lowest level in six weeks.MORE COVERAGE:This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92020 FOX Television Stations",
