So why has the United States been so slow in its attempt to develop reliable diagnostic tests and use them widely?The World Health Organization (WHO) has shipped testing kits to 57 countries. China had five commercial tests on the market 1 month ago and can now do up to 1.6 million tests a week; South Korea has tested 65,000 people so far. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in contrast, has done only 459 tests since the epidemic began. The rollout of a CDC-designed test kit to state and local labs has become a fiasco because it contained a faulty reagent. Labs around the country eager to test more suspected cases\u2014and test them faster\u2014have been unable to do so. No commercial or state labs have the approval to use their own tests.In what is already an infamous snafu, CDC initially refused a request to test a patient in Northern California who turned out to be the first probable COVID19 case without known links to an infected person.The situation may soon improve. State labs and commercial diagnostic developers hope to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for their own tests, and FDA and CDC on Wednesday agreed on a workaround for the faulty CDC kit\u2014which has a problem that is not essential to its proper functioning\u2014so that it can now be used by at least some of the state labs that have it.But there\u2019s widespread discontent with the way the system has worked. \u201cThe U.S. government has not appropriately prioritized diagnostic tests and supported the laboratory response network to the degree they should have been supported over the years,\u201d says Luciana Borio, who in previous jobs had lead roles in responding to emerging threats at the National Security Council and FDA.If a new disease emerges, CDC normally \u201cgets the ball rolling\u201d with diagnostics because it has the expertise and the biosafety laboratories to handle dangerous novel pathogens, says Borio, who now works for In-Q-Tel, a not-for-profit venture capital firm. Typically, there are few confirmed viral samples from patients at the outset, which researchers need to validate their tests, and CDC has the capability to grow the virus for this critical quality assurance step. Once the agency has a working test, that goes out to state labs. Then, in a third phase, commercial labs take over and either produce their own tests or scale-up the CDC one. \u201cI would have hoped to see that third phase by now,\u201d Borio says.In the case of SARS-CoV-2, as the virus causing COVID-19 is officially known, CDC\u2019s sluggishness was apparent 1\u00a0month ago. On 26 January, the agency held an unusual Sunday teleconference for the media to provide an update about the rapidly growing outbreak. There were then five cases in the United States, but the CDC lab in Atlanta was still the only one in the country able to test for the virus, and it repeatedly had backlogs. Asked why more labs weren\u2019t able to do the tests, Nancy Messonnier, who then was leading CDC\u2019s response, said it was a quality issue. \u201cWe hold ourselves to an incredibly high standard of precision in terms of laboratory testing,\u201d Messonnier said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want to inadvertently make a mistake in patient care.\u201dCDC finally started to send\u00a0kits to state and local health labs on 5 February. But on 12 February, it revealed that several labs had difficulty validating the test because of a problem with one of the reagents.The key problem with the kits is what\u2019s known as a negative control, says Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious diseases at the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL). CDC\u2019s test uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to find tiny amounts of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in, say, a nose swab. To make sure a test is working properly, kits also include DNA unrelated to SARS-CoV-2. The assay should not react to this negative control, but the CDC reagents did at many, but not all, state labs. The labs where the negative control failed were not allowed to use the test; they have to continue to send their samples to Atlanta.The declaration of a public health emergency \u2026 limited the diagnostic capacity of this country. It\u2019s insane.But at the moment, they\u2019re not allowed to do that without FDA approval. When the United States\u00a0declared the outbreak\u00a0a public health emergency\u00a0on 31 January, a bureaucratic process kicked in that requires FDA\u2019s \u201cemergency use approval\u201d for any tests. \u201cThe declaration of a public health emergency did exactly what it shouldn\u2019t have. It limited the diagnostic capacity of this country,\u201d Mina says. \u201cIt\u2019s insane.\u201dOn 24 February, APHL asked FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn for \u201cenforcement discretion\u201d to sidestep the emergency process and allow APHL members labs to use their own tests. On 26 February, Hahn replied that the CDC test could be modified to use just the primers that specifically detect SARS-CoV-2, essentially ignoring the faulty portion of the kits. FDA, in other words, would look the other way to make more widespread testing possible.CDC has notified labs of FDA\u2019s decision in a letter, but the agency must still file an emergency use authorization with FDA for the protocol change. Once it does, it won\u2019t take long, Hahn promised in his letter to APHL: \u201cFDA has been able to authorize tests for public health emergencies within as little as 1 day upon receipt of the complete validation.\u201dIn New York, the State Department of Health has\u00a0designed its own test\u00a0based on the CDC protocol and plans to seek emergency use authorization.CDC provided an update about the situation in an email but did not respond to\u00a0Science\u2019s\u00a0request for an interview with a scientist to discuss the details of the problem. Mina stresses he has great respect for CDC\u2019s competence overall, but says, \u201cThere\u2019s no good explanation for what\u2019s going on here.\u201ddoi:10.1126/science.abb5152Jon is a staff writer for Science.By Jon CohenMar. 9, 2020By Rodrigo P\u00e9rez Ortega Feb. 27, 2020By Rodrigo P\u00e9rez Ortega Feb. 26, 2020By Rodrigo P\u00e9rez Ortega Feb. 21, 2020By Rodrigo P\u00e9rez Ortega Jan. 21, 2020More SifterVol 367,\n\n      Issue 6483\u00a9 2020\u00a0American Association for the Advancement of Science.

            "main_text": "Public health agencies around the world are preparing for COVID-19, the novel coronavirus that has spread from China to multiple regions of the world. We now see more cases outside of China than inside, and we\u2019re also hearing of cases inside the U.S. among people without known travel contact. One critical lesson from our experience with H1N1 a decade ago is worth highlighting: We must integrate our nation\u2019s 5,000 jails, prisons and immigration detention centers with our pandemic response efforts.In the spring of 2009, we also faced a novel viral threat to health in the form of H1N1, which the CDC now estimates took between approximately 150,000 and 500,000 lives worldwide in the first 12 months of activity. Much of this illness occurred among young people, who lacked antibodies for this strain of flu. Working inside the health service of the New York City jail system, we confronted a wide array of issues in responding to H1N1, from decisions about how to set up surveillance for influenza-like illness, to diagnosis and treatment of suspected cases and isolation of housing areas of the jails where people were ill.One large advantage we had was that our health service was a division of the nation\u2019s pre-eminent public health department, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). In the decade since, I\u2019ve responded to seasonal influenza, pertussis, legionella and many other outbreaks within correctional settings. Here are a few lessons that are critical for sheriffs, commissioners of correction and public health officials to consider.COVID-19 will remind us of a central hypocrisy in our approach to health behind bars. We\u2019ve built the world\u2019s largest collection of jails and prisons, and kept the health services in these places remarkably separate from the rest of our national health systems. The CDC, state departments of health, the Joint Commission and other bodies that promote evidence-based care in our hospitals, ambulatory care clinics and nursing homes are largely absent in these settings. As a result, management of this pandemic will be harder and less effective for incarcerated people, their families and staff in these institutions.As we struggle to make headway in this specific response, it should remind us that the goals of promoting health and addressing mass incarceration both require that we finally connect these institutions to our community-based systems of health.Dr. Homer Venters is the former chief medical officer of the New York City Jail System and president of Community Oriented Correctional Health Services (COCHS).View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92020 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc.",

            "main_text": "The port of Baltimore\u2019s booming container terminal will reduce its operating hours next week because of declines in incoming cargo due to the international coronavirus outbreak, officials said Friday.Seagirt Marine Terminal will open at 7 a.m., and the inbound gate will close at 4:45 p.m. beginning Sunday, according to Ports America Chesapeake, the company that operates the state-owned terminal under a 50-year agreement. That schedule cuts an hour and 15 minutes from the typical port workday.\u201cOur hope is these actions are short lived, but the disruptions in the global supply chain as a result of the Coronavirus outbreak are significant and unprecedented,\u201d the company said in a memo Thursday to port stakeholders obtained Friday by The Baltimore Sun.Three more Marylanders are being tested for COVID-19, the coronavirus disease that has sickened more than 80,000 people globally, state officials confirmed this week. Two previously tested negative for the virus.The Maryland Port Administration has not provided an estimate of how much the global outbreak will affect the port of Baltimore\u2019s cargo volumes.Volumes at many U.S. ports could drop 20% or more in the first three months of the year, according to the American Association of Port Authorities, which represents 130 of the top ports in the U.S., Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean.Ports in Georgia, which handle nearly $20 billion in Chinese imports each year, expect to see shipments drop by as much as 40% in March and April, according to that state\u2019s projections.\u201cWhile the global economic impacts to the port and maritime industry from the coronavirus outbreak are significant and growing, the human impacts are our greatest concern,\" Chris Connor, the association\u2019s president and CEO, said in a statement. \u201cThe most important things are to ensure that as few people as possible become infected, that those who have been infected are well treated and receive quality care, and that we mourn for those whose lives have been tragically cut short by this pathogen crisis.\u201dThe limited hours at the Baltimore container terminal are a result of \u201ca reduction in volumes from disruptions in the global supply chain,\u201d the port administration said in a statement. The agency noted that the hours reduction is scheduled to go into effect only at Seagirt and not at the other five public marine terminals.\u201cWe will continue to monitor the situation and adjust terminal hours as conditions change,\u201d Ports America Chesapeake\u2019s memo said. \u201cThank you for your understanding during this international event.\u201dDockworkers could face fewer hours and smaller paychecks as a result of the slowdown, said Scott Cowan, president of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association Local 333.\u201cIt will affect the amount of hours they get, and their earning potential,\u201d Cowan said.Cowan said he\u2019s told his 1,650 members the cutback in hours could last a few months.\u201cThis is something no one has control over,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think this is a long-term problem. I think it will bounce back.\u201dThe reduction in hours at Seagirt comes as ports around the country have been grappling with spikes in container volume because of shippers importing goods early to beat U.S. tariff deadlines, which have been postponed until April from an original Jan. 1 deadline.Ports America had extended the terminal\u2019s daily gate hours and offered extra weekend hours earlier this month to address the congestion.The supply chain disruption also follows several years of cargo records at the container terminal. The Port of Baltimore handled a record 43.6 million tons of cargo last year.The port\u2019s cruise operators are also taking coronavirus precautions.Passengers bound for the Bahamas or elsewhere from Baltimore\u2019s cruise terminal will be screened for the virus, and the cruise lines won\u2019t allow boarding to anyone who has visited areas affected by the coronavirus or who has come into contact with others who have been to those areas in the past two weeks, officials said Thursday.After The Baltimore Sun contacted Ports America with questions about the coronavirus memo, the company posted the memo about the reduced hours on its website \u2014 without any reference to the coronavirus.\u201cPorts America Chesapeake\u2019s announcement [on Thursday] was simply to advise the trucking community of reduced operating hours,\u201d company spokeswoman Jeanne Futuyma said in an brief emailed statement.She did not explain why references to the coronavirus were removed in the version posted online.\u201cWe will not be providing additional information,\u201d she said in an email response to follow-up questions.Baltimore Sun reporters Alison Knezevich, Meredith Cohn, Kevin Rector and Jean Marbella contributed to this article.",

            "headline": "Port of Baltimore reducing hours due to \u2018significant and unprecedented\u2019 shipping disruptions from coronavirus",
            "main_text": "The port of Baltimore\u2019s booming container terminal will reduce its operating hours next week because of declines in incoming cargo due to the international coronavirus outbreak, officials said Friday.Seagirt Marine Terminal will open at 7 a.m., and the inbound gate will close at 4:45 p.m. beginning Sunday, according to Ports America Chesapeake, the company that operates the state-owned terminal under a 50-year agreement. That schedule cuts an hour and 15 minutes from the typical port workday.\u201cOur hope is these actions are short lived, but the disruptions in the global supply chain as a result of the Coronavirus outbreak are significant and unprecedented,\u201d the company said in a memo Thursday to port stakeholders obtained Friday by The Baltimore Sun.Three more Marylanders are being tested for COVID-19, the coronavirus disease that has sickened more than 80,000 people globally, state officials confirmed this week. Two previously tested negative for the virus.The Maryland Port Administration has not provided an estimate of how much the global outbreak will affect the port of Baltimore\u2019s cargo volumes.Volumes at many U.S. ports could drop 20% or more in the first three months of the year, according to the American Association of Port Authorities, which represents 130 of the top ports in the U.S., Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean.Ports in Georgia, which handle nearly $20 billion in Chinese imports each year, expect to see shipments drop by as much as 40% in March and April, according to that state\u2019s projections.\u201cWhile the global economic impacts to the port and maritime industry from the coronavirus outbreak are significant and growing, the human impacts are our greatest concern,\" Chris Connor, the association\u2019s president and CEO, said in a statement. \u201cThe most important things are to ensure that as few people as possible become infected, that those who have been infected are well treated and receive quality care, and that we mourn for those whose lives have been tragically cut short by this pathogen crisis.\u201dThe limited hours at the Baltimore container terminal are a result of \u201ca reduction in volumes from disruptions in the global supply chain,\u201d the port administration said in a statement. The agency noted that the hours reduction is scheduled to go into effect only at Seagirt and not at the other five public marine terminals.\u201cWe will continue to monitor the situation and adjust terminal hours as conditions change,\u201d Ports America Chesapeake\u2019s memo said. \u201cThank you for your understanding during this international event.\u201dDockworkers could face fewer hours and smaller paychecks as a result of the slowdown, said Scott Cowan, president of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association Local 333.\u201cIt will affect the amount of hours they get, and their earning potential,\u201d Cowan said.Cowan said he\u2019s told his 1,650 members the cutback in hours could last a few months.\u201cThis is something no one has control over,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think this is a long-term problem. I think it will bounce back.\u201dThe reduction in hours at Seagirt comes as ports around the country have been grappling with spikes in container volume because of shippers importing goods early to beat U.S. tariff deadlines, which have been postponed until April from an original Jan. 1 deadline.Ports America had extended the terminal\u2019s daily gate hours and offered extra weekend hours earlier this month to address the congestion.The supply chain disruption also follows several years of cargo records at the container terminal. The Port of Baltimore handled a record 43.6 million tons of cargo last year.The port\u2019s cruise operators are also taking coronavirus precautions.Passengers bound for the Bahamas or elsewhere from Baltimore\u2019s cruise terminal will be screened for the virus, and the cruise lines won\u2019t allow boarding to anyone who has visited areas affected by the coronavirus or who has come into contact with others who have been to those areas in the past two weeks, officials said Thursday.After The Baltimore Sun contacted Ports America with questions about the coronavirus memo, the company posted the memo about the reduced hours on its website \u2014 without any reference to the coronavirus.\u201cPorts America Chesapeake\u2019s announcement [on Thursday] was simply to advise the trucking community of reduced operating hours,\u201d company spokeswoman Jeanne Futuyma said in an brief emailed statement.She did not explain why references to the coronavirus were removed in the version posted online.\u201cWe will not be providing additional information,\u201d she said in an email response to follow-up questions.Baltimore Sun reporters Alison Knezevich, Meredith Cohn, Kevin Rector and Jean Marbella contributed to this article.",

But it said they normally increase once the celebrations are over.\"This year, the reduction rate is more significant than in past years and it has lasted longer,\" Ms Liu said.\"I am not surprised because many cities nationwide have taken measures to minimise spread of the virus.\"Coronavirus screening leads to huge queues at Chicago O'Hare, as more countries impose restrictions.Have you been getting these songs wrong?What happens to your body in extreme heat?",

[+] outbreak.The squares of Rio were empty. Sounds of singing and dancing had been replaced by an unnatural, eerie silence. In Korea, authorities banned public gatherings and imposed a strict quarantine. Neighborhoods were put under curfew. In Odessa, as social order broke down people fell back on ancient rituals and superstitions. These are not accounts of the current coronavirus epidemic, but of the 1918-1919 Spanish Flu that killed perhaps 50 million.A pandemic was raging. Some evidence suggested it had begun in China, but its origins remained mysterious. Regardless, the infection had spread at breakneck pace. Outbreaks were reported from India to Ireland, Siberia to South Africa. Doctors appeared helpless to contain the virus\u2019s deadly progress.Hospital wards were packed. The disease seemed to strike young and healthy adults with frightening virulence. Once infected, the unluckiest experienced a series of increasingly terrifying symptoms. Aches and chills developed into fever. Then inflammation kicked in, giving the face a dusky red complexion. Lungs bled and sufferers gasped for air, drowning in their own fluids. The lack of oxygen turned the skin blue, then black. After that, the end usually came quickly.The pandemic battered a world already reeling from WWI. While WWI may be better remembered, the Spanish Flu killed three times as many in one year as WWI did in four. As we confront another global health crisis, this \u201cforgotten pandemic\u201d offers essential lessons that could save millions today.Observers could have been forgiven for initially overlooking the Spanish Flu in early 1918. In Russia, the Bolsheviks had seized power and were making peace with Germany. In late March, Germany unleashed an all-out assault on the Western Front, hoping to win the war before enough Americans arrived to turn the tide. The onslaught had brought the Allied armies to the breaking point. Then, soldiers began falling sick.The Germans may have fared somewhat worse, but both sides recognized that news of the outbreaks in their trenches would be a propaganda disaster. Thus, all reporting was strictly censored. Neutral Spain, also hit by the virus, had no such restrictions. Hence, the disease acquired its enduring nickname: the Spanish Flu. The Spanish, for their part, blamed the Portuguese.WWI provided the pandemic with ideal conditions to spread. Millions of men came to the crowded, mud-soaked and filthy trenches of Europe. Unhygienic conditions were compounded by the extreme physical strain of battle, constant shelling and repeated gas attacks. Laborers from as far afield as China came to indirectly support the war effort. On the homefront, many civilian populations faced starvation, lowering their resistance to illness.The Spring wave was just the beginning. In Autumn, as the war neared its end, the virus returned with a vengeance. Death came with breathtaking speed and scope. Perversely, this second wave seemed disproportionately to strike down those in the prime of life. Many survived the war only to die of the flu. Most of carnage occurred in just 13 weeks. In October 1918, nearly 200,000 Americans died, almost double the total American deaths in WWI.Around the world, death rates were significantly higher. Indigenous peoples were worst affected, victimized by natural susceptibilities and denied adequate care by racist colonial authorities. In Samoa, almost 25% of the population died. Maori New Zealanders were nearly ten-times more likely to die than their European neighbors. India alone may have lost over 15 million people. On every continent except Europe, deaths from the Spanish Flu dwarfed the death toll of WWI.In 1918, New York was already the world\u2019s most diverse city and quite possibly its largest too. Recent immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe crammed into shabby tenements. Electricity and running water were intermittent luxuries for families who often shared a single room. Few new arrivals spoke English, and many were distrustful of local authorities and modern medicine. New York seemed primed for a devastating outbreak.Beyond its crowded slums, New York had yet another strike against it. The city was the departure and arrival point for troops headed to the battlefields of France. New York\u2019s authorities could not close the port while over a million soldiers passed through the city. Crowded troop transports were the perfect vector for the virus. On one transatlantic crossing, the transport ship Leviathan saw over 2000 men stricken. More than 90 had died before the Leviathan reached France.Royal S. Copeland, the newly appointed president of the New York City Board of Health, confronted these challenges as the deadly second wave spread. Early on, he and his team made a few serious mistakes. Although influenza was identified in August on a Norwegian passenger vessel, reporting the flu only became mandatory in late September. Health authorities initially moved slowly in combating the disease. They believed that infections would soon peak and then decline, and they feared that dramatic measures might unhelpfully panic the public. Reflecting the medical orthodoxy of the time, Copeland also failed to realize that asymptomatic carriers of the flu could be contagious.Despite these errors, Copeland made three critical decisions which probably saved thousands. Recognizing that New York\u2019s packed streets and subways could serve to spread the disease, he coordinated with businesses to stagger working hours. The unconventional schedule helped eliminate the notorious rush-hour crowds. Second, Copeland established a \u201cclearinghouse\u201d system. He opened over 150 emergency health centers throughout the city. These clearinghouses supported local health care and tracked the incidence of the disease in different neighborhoods. The improved data collection allowed physicians to better understand critical details of the outbreak. Finally, at the urging of his lieutenant, Josephine Baker, Copeland decided to keep the schools open.Copeland received withering criticism for not closing the schools. He argued, \u201cthe children are better protected in the schools than they would be in the streets.\u201d In school, teachers and health inspectors could identify the early signs of illness and send the children for treatment. For many immigrant children, school provided a more hygienic and healthier environment than their homes. Additionally, schools could share public health information with children who would disseminate it to their parents. This system proved invaluable for keeping New Yorkers informed during the crisis.Copeland and Baker were vindicated by the low number of New York City schoolchildren who came down with the flu that Fall. New York also benefitted from strong health infrastructure previously developed to fight tuberculosis. That infrastructure included education campaigns against coughing, sneezing, and spitting, medical surveillance, and social distancing techniques. Although Copeland waited too long to declare the crisis, when he did, he leveraged a well-organized public health system to respond aggressively. Using schools and theaters to share vital health updates, he effectively communicated his directives across the city.Although thousands of New Yorkers died, the city suffered comparatively less than many others. New York\u2019s excess mortality was almost 30% lower than in Boston and nearly 40% lower than in Philadelphia.Today\u2019s interconnected world remains susceptible to global pandemics. International supply chains and commercial air travel allow people and viruses to quickly circle the planet. In just two months, Coronavirus has spread to over 50 countries on six continents. The WHO expects infections to keep rising. A CDC director explained that a wider U.S. outbreak was no longer an \u201cif\u201d but a \u201cwhen.\u201d Although researchers are working on a vaccine, best-case estimates suggest widespread availability is over a year away.Without understating the threat, humanity has made remarkable strides in disease control and treatment. In 1918, most leading scientists did not believe that flu was caused by a virus. The field of virology was barely in its infancy, whereas today it is a well-studied and central part of medical practice. More effective containment measures have been developed by understanding precisely how diseases spread. Far more societies have built robust public health systems that can protect the healthy and greatly improve survival for the sick. These developments complement medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs that have added potent weapons to our health arsenal.However, at a fundamental level, what was effective against the Spanish Flu remains effective against Coronavirus. New York\u2019s relatively successful handling of the pandemic offers three clear lessons. First, data is key. Through the clearinghouses and public schools, Copeland and health authorities could monitor how and where the disease was spreading and quickly react. Second, good communication of information can be lifesaving. Copeland enlisted children to share vital health information with their families. The best public health practices are only impactful when widely understood and adopted. Finally, in a crisis, the public health infrastructure, not the law, is what stands between order and chaos. Even if Copeland could have implemented draconian measures to lock down the city, they would have likely been counterproductive. A ruthless approach would have harmed his communication efforts and reduced the willingness of marginalized immigrants to seek care.As in 1918, common-sense health measures can reduce the chance of infection. These include thorough hand-washing, not touching your face, disinfecting communal surfaces, staying away from anyone coughing or sneezing, and promptly seeking medical attention if you have a fever. In addition, stay apprised of the latest information from health authorities, your employer, and your doctor.

[+] outbreak.The squares of Rio were empty. Sounds of singing and dancing had been replaced by an unnatural, eerie silence. In Korea, authorities banned public gatherings and imposed a strict quarantine. Neighborhoods were put under curfew. In Odessa, as social order broke down people fell back on ancient rituals and superstitions. These are not accounts of the current coronavirus epidemic, but of the 1918-1919 Spanish Flu that killed perhaps 50 million.A pandemic was raging. Some evidence suggested it had begun in China, but its origins remained mysterious. Regardless, the infection had spread at breakneck pace. Outbreaks were reported from India to Ireland, Siberia to South Africa. Doctors appeared helpless to contain the virus\u2019s deadly progress.Hospital wards were packed. The disease seemed to strike young and healthy adults with frightening virulence. Once infected, the unluckiest experienced a series of increasingly terrifying symptoms. Aches and chills developed into fever. Then inflammation kicked in, giving the face a dusky red complexion. Lungs bled and sufferers gasped for air, drowning in their own fluids. The lack of oxygen turned the skin blue, then black. After that, the end usually came quickly.The pandemic battered a world already reeling from WWI. While WWI may be better remembered, the Spanish Flu killed three times as many in one year as WWI did in four. As we confront another global health crisis, this \u201cforgotten pandemic\u201d offers essential lessons that could save millions today.Observers could have been forgiven for initially overlooking the Spanish Flu in early 1918. In Russia, the Bolsheviks had seized power and were making peace with Germany. In late March, Germany unleashed an all-out assault on the Western Front, hoping to win the war before enough Americans arrived to turn the tide. The onslaught had brought the Allied armies to the breaking point. Then, soldiers began falling sick.The Germans may have fared somewhat worse, but both sides recognized that news of the outbreaks in their trenches would be a propaganda disaster. Thus, all reporting was strictly censored. Neutral Spain, also hit by the virus, had no such restrictions. Hence, the disease acquired its enduring nickname: the Spanish Flu. The Spanish, for their part, blamed the Portuguese.WWI provided the pandemic with ideal conditions to spread. Millions of men came to the crowded, mud-soaked and filthy trenches of Europe. Unhygienic conditions were compounded by the extreme physical strain of battle, constant shelling and repeated gas attacks. Laborers from as far afield as China came to indirectly support the war effort. On the homefront, many civilian populations faced starvation, lowering their resistance to illness.The Spring wave was just the beginning. In Autumn, as the war neared its end, the virus returned with a vengeance. Death came with breathtaking speed and scope. Perversely, this second wave seemed disproportionately to strike down those in the prime of life. Many survived the war only to die of the flu. Most of carnage occurred in just 13 weeks. In October 1918, nearly 200,000 Americans died, almost double the total American deaths in WWI.Around the world, death rates were significantly higher. Indigenous peoples were worst affected, victimized by natural susceptibilities and denied adequate care by racist colonial authorities. In Samoa, almost 25% of the population died. Maori New Zealanders were nearly ten-times more likely to die than their European neighbors. India alone may have lost over 15 million people. On every continent except Europe, deaths from the Spanish Flu dwarfed the death toll of WWI.In 1918, New York was already the world\u2019s most diverse city and quite possibly its largest too. Recent immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe crammed into shabby tenements. Electricity and running water were intermittent luxuries for families who often shared a single room. Few new arrivals spoke English, and many were distrustful of local authorities and modern medicine. New York seemed primed for a devastating outbreak.Beyond its crowded slums, New York had yet another strike against it. The city was the departure and arrival point for troops headed to the battlefields of France. New York\u2019s authorities could not close the port while over a million soldiers passed through the city. Crowded troop transports were the perfect vector for the virus. On one transatlantic crossing, the transport ship Leviathan saw over 2000 men stricken. More than 90 had died before the Leviathan reached France.Royal S. Copeland, the newly appointed president of the New York City Board of Health, confronted these challenges as the deadly second wave spread. Early on, he and his team made a few serious mistakes. Although influenza was identified in August on a Norwegian passenger vessel, reporting the flu only became mandatory in late September. Health authorities initially moved slowly in combating the disease. They believed that infections would soon peak and then decline, and they feared that dramatic measures might unhelpfully panic the public. Reflecting the medical orthodoxy of the time, Copeland also failed to realize that asymptomatic carriers of the flu could be contagious.Despite these errors, Copeland made three critical decisions which probably saved thousands. Recognizing that New York\u2019s packed streets and subways could serve to spread the disease, he coordinated with businesses to stagger working hours. The unconventional schedule helped eliminate the notorious rush-hour crowds. Second, Copeland established a \u201cclearinghouse\u201d system. He opened over 150 emergency health centers throughout the city. These clearinghouses supported local health care and tracked the incidence of the disease in different neighborhoods. The improved data collection allowed physicians to better understand critical details of the outbreak. Finally, at the urging of his lieutenant, Josephine Baker, Copeland decided to keep the schools open.Copeland received withering criticism for not closing the schools. He argued, \u201cthe children are better protected in the schools than they would be in the streets.\u201d In school, teachers and health inspectors could identify the early signs of illness and send the children for treatment. For many immigrant children, school provided a more hygienic and healthier environment than their homes. Additionally, schools could share public health information with children who would disseminate it to their parents. This system proved invaluable for keeping New Yorkers informed during the crisis.Copeland and Baker were vindicated by the low number of New York City schoolchildren who came down with the flu that Fall. New York also benefitted from strong health infrastructure previously developed to fight tuberculosis. That infrastructure included education campaigns against coughing, sneezing, and spitting, medical surveillance, and social distancing techniques. Although Copeland waited too long to declare the crisis, when he did, he leveraged a well-organized public health system to respond aggressively. Using schools and theaters to share vital health updates, he effectively communicated his directives across the city.Although thousands of New Yorkers died, the city suffered comparatively less than many others. New York\u2019s excess mortality was almost 30% lower than in Boston and nearly 40% lower than in Philadelphia.Today\u2019s interconnected world remains susceptible to global pandemics. International supply chains and commercial air travel allow people and viruses to quickly circle the planet. In just two months, Coronavirus has spread to over 50 countries on six continents. The WHO expects infections to keep rising. A CDC director explained that a wider U.S. outbreak was no longer an \u201cif\u201d but a \u201cwhen.\u201d Although researchers are working on a vaccine, best-case estimates suggest widespread availability is over a year away.Without understating the threat, humanity has made remarkable strides in disease control and treatment. In 1918, most leading scientists did not believe that flu was caused by a virus. The field of virology was barely in its infancy, whereas today it is a well-studied and central part of medical practice. More effective containment measures have been developed by understanding precisely how diseases spread. Far more societies have built robust public health systems that can protect the healthy and greatly improve survival for the sick. These developments complement medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs that have added potent weapons to our health arsenal.However, at a fundamental level, what was effective against the Spanish Flu remains effective against Coronavirus. New York\u2019s relatively successful handling of the pandemic offers three clear lessons. First, data is key. Through the clearinghouses and public schools, Copeland and health authorities could monitor how and where the disease was spreading and quickly react. Second, good communication of information can be lifesaving. Copeland enlisted children to share vital health information with their families. The best public health practices are only impactful when widely understood and adopted. Finally, in a crisis, the public health infrastructure, not the law, is what stands between order and chaos. Even if Copeland could have implemented draconian measures to lock down the city, they would have likely been counterproductive. A ruthless approach would have harmed his communication efforts and reduced the willingness of marginalized immigrants to seek care.As in 1918, common-sense health measures can reduce the chance of infection. These include thorough hand-washing, not touching your face, disinfecting communal surfaces, staying away from anyone coughing or sneezing, and promptly seeking medical attention if you have a fever. In addition, stay apprised of the latest information from health authorities, your employer, and your doctor. No matter how Coronavirus progresses, smart practices can limit risks and save lives.I lead a UN program for global banks to address and manage climate risk.

            "headline": "Three states report new community spread of COVID-19",
            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.Three western US states reported new community-acquired COVID-19 cases last night\u2014California, Oregon, and Washington\u2014a development that closely follows a change in federal policy that frees state public health labs to test for the virus.The announcements bring the number of cases involving community spread to four and come just 2 days after the first such case was announced in California. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a statement last night that it was aware of four new presumed positive cases, which also includes a new travel-linked case in Washington.All findings will undergo confirmation tests at the CDC, but the agency said state health officials will proceed with their investigations and response as if the cases were confirmed. It said the new confirmed cases bring the number detected by the US public health system to 19.The new case in California was announced by Santa Clara County public health officials at a media briefing and involves an adult who was experiencing breathing problems and whose infectious disease physician reached out to county health officials for testing on Feb 26. The public health lab's testing confirmed the infection the next day, and county health officials immediately began tracing contacts.Earlier in the day, the California Department of Public Health announced that test kits from the CDC now available in California can be used to do diagnostic testing in the community. It also said it expected another shipment of test kits to test as many as 1,200 people.In a news release, Santa Clara Public Health said the COVID-19 case is its third and is not linked to the earlier two cases, which involved unrelated travelers who had both been in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began.County officials said the community-transmission case announced last night involves an older woman who has chronic health conditions and was hospitalized for a respiratory illness. They added that the woman has no known exposure through travel or close contact with an infected person.Sara Cody, MD, who directs the Santa Clara Public Health Department, said the new case indicates evidence of community transmission, but the extent isn't clear. \"I understand this may be concerning to hear, but this is what we have been preparing for. Now we need to start taking additional actions to slow down the spread of the disease.\"In its statement, the county said the case is important, because it signals a change in course: Health officials will continue taking steps such as isolation, quarantine, and contact tracing to slow the spread of the disease, but a key priority is now community surveillance to gauge the extent of virus circulation.Shortly after Santa Clara County announced its case, Oregon Health Authority announced a presumed positive case involving a Washington County resident whose symptoms began on Feb 19 and who was tested yesterday. Oregon's state public health lab used the new COVID-19 test kit that it received on Feb 26 from the CDC. The positive result yesterday came just hours after the lab ran tests that were needed to validate the new CDC test kit.The patient wasn't an earlier suspected case, didn't have a history of travel, and isn't a known contact of an earlier case. Investigators found that the patient had spent time in a school in Lake Oswego school district, where exposures to students and staff were possible. They are following up with employees and children's families to determine the next steps.Meanwhile, the patient is in isolation and treatment at Kaiser Permanente Westside Medical Center in Hillsboro.Washington state health officials last night announced two presumptive positive cases, one community-acquired and the other in a woman who traveled a South Korea COVID-19 hot spot, the city of Daegu.The community case involves a high school boy from Snohomish County who was sick earlier this week and visited Seattle Children's North Clinic on Feb 24. He had no travel history or connection to earlier cases. The student felt better and returned to school, but was placed on home isolation after tests were positive for COVID-19.At a media briefing, health officials said the boy is doing well and is in home isolation and that a small number of students who were identified as close contacts are on 14-day quarantine. Jackson High School will be closed through Monday for deep cleaning.Kathy Lofy, MD, state health officer, said in a statement, \"Now that we are able to expedite test results here at the Public Health Lab in Shoreline, we're getting results on suspected local cases a lot faster.\"The second case involves a King County woman in her 50s who is in home isolation. At the media briefing, Jeffrey Duchin, MD, health officer with Public Health-Seattle and King County, said she traveled to South Korea between Feb 7 and Feb 23 and returned to work for 1 day, then stayed home when she started feeling sick. Her husband contacted health officials on Feb 26, who sent a team to test the woman in her home.He said the woman's husband is well and is under quarantine, and he added that health officials expect to see more cases.Get CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now\u00bbUnrestricted financial support provided byGrant support for ASP provided byBecome an underwriter\u00bbCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.In quickly evolving developments today, Washington state reported the nation's first COVID-19 death and two additional cases in a Seattle area nursing home, prompting the state's governor to declare a state of emergency.At the federal level, officials today announced new travel restrictions involving Iran, parts of Italy, and parts of South Korea.And in international novel coronavirus developments, cases continued to surge in the three main hot spots, two countries reported cases imported from Egypt, and at least three more countries reported their first cases: Ecuador, Monaco, and Qatar.At a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) briefing today, Nancy Messonnier, MD, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the cases lift the number detected by the US public health system to 22. She add that, although the illnesses are still under investigation, they raise the level of concern for certain communities in the United States.Jeffrey Duchin, MD, health officer with Public Health\u2013Seattle & King County, said that, of the three new cases reported by Washington today, none appear to be linked to travel and are considered presumed positives.Two are related to LifeCare Center, a long-term care facility in Kirkland. One involves a female healthcare worker who is hospitalized in satisfactory condition at Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue, and the other patient is a 70-year-old resident who is in serious condition at EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland.Duchin said health officials are evaluating several other people with symptoms at the facility, including 27 of 108 residents and 25 of 180 staff. A CDC team is expected to arrive tonight to assist with the investigation.The fatal case, which he said doesn't appear to be linked to the nursing home outbreak, involves a man in his 50s with underlying medical conditions who was hospitalized at EvergreenHealth Medical Center.Notice of the three new cases in Washington state today follow announcements last night of two other cases of community transmission in the state, involving a high school boy and a woman who had traveled to South Korea. Combined with cases announced yesterday by California and Oregon, the United States now has seven community-transmission cases.At a White House media briefing, President Donald Trump and other federal officials expressed their condolences to the family of the Washington patient.Trump said the country took aggressive early actions, and though more cases are likely, the risk to the nation is still low and infections are mild for most people. He also added that he will meet with pharmaceutical companies at the White House on Monday to discuss issues related to the development of drugs and vaccines.Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the White House's COVID-19 task force, detailed new travel restrictions, similar to the temporary ban announced in late January on people coming from China. The new measures apply to all travelers coming from Iran, including other foreign nationals, and travelers coming from the most affected areas of Italy and South Korea.He also said discussions are under way to step up medical screening in people in other affected countries who will be traveling to the United States. He added that the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response is taking steps to increase the availability of masks\u2014designed to provide 34 million more a month\u2014to protect healthcare workers.Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said community spread now being reported in the United States will require a focus on state and local public health measures to identify and isolate cases and trace contacts. \"The country as a whole is still at low risk, but this is an evolving situation.\"The CDC yesterday boosted travel warnings for Iran and Italy to the highest level, which urges people to avoid nonessential travel due to widespread community transmission and limited access to medical care.In Iran, the health ministry reported 205 more cases and 9 more deaths, raising those respective totals to 595 and 43. Italy today reported 161 more cases and 8 more deaths, lifting its respective totals to 1,049 and 29.The pace of new infections surged even higher in South Korea, with 813 more cases reported today, raising the country's total to 3,150. Four more people died from their infections, putting the fatality count at 17. In one of the daily updates today, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention detailed epidemiologic information on the first 16 deaths, all involving patients who had underlying medical conditions. The deaths occurred mainly in seniors, though 1 involved a patient in his 30s.

            "main_text": "New York State is ready to start testing for potential cases of the novel coronavirus, joining New Jersey and Connecticut, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday.The news came hours before New York City health officials announced the results of the latest possible COVID-19 case in the city. The eighth person tested in New York City by the CDC does not have novel coronavirus, city health officials said Saturday afternoon.As of Friday, New York still didn't have permission from the Centers for Disease Control to begin testing, but Cuomo on Saturday morning said his office \"just received word that our test has been approved by the FDA.\"New York State\u2019s Wadsworth Lab will begin testing immediately.\"When I spoke to Vice President [Mike] Pence, I urged him to approve New York State's coronavirus test \u2014 we just received word that our test has been approved by the FDA,\" Cuomo said in a statement. \"This will expedite wait time and improve NY's ability to more effectively manage the coronavirus situation as it unfolds.\"\"New York State's Wadsworth Lab will begin testing immediately,\" he added.Top news stories in the tri-state area, in America and around the worldThe patient tested over the weekend was a New York City resident who recently came back from a trip to Italy, according to officials. The patient's sample was sent to Atlanta for testing, before New York had received its approval.The patient began exhibiting symptoms shortly after returning from a trip to Italy, where NBC News confirmed there are nearly 900 people infected, in addition to 21 deaths. Symptoms \u2014 which include fever, coughing and shortness of breath \u2014 are likely to appear as soon as two days after exposure, or up to two weeks later, according to the CDC.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio sounded off on Twitter over the testing delays, pointing the finger at the Trump administration for not heeding warnings sooner.\"We've gotten every conceivable warning about the coronavirus from health authorities across the country and globe. It\u2019s been coming like a freight train and the Trump administration hasn\u2019t even done the basics,\" the mayor said in a tweet.Meanwhile, the New Jersey Public Health Department said Friday that a lab in West Trenton had been approved to test for the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont also said that a state lab will be able to conduct testing shortly.In a teleconference, the CDC said the goal is to have testing available in all 50 states by the end of next week. When presses about which states and places have the capacity, the CDC would not give specifics citing the evolving situation.We are currently investigating one person in New York City for #COVID19, the illness caused by novel #coronavirus. The person reported symptoms and recent travel to Italy. This person will be tested by @CDCgov and we will update results soon. The latest: https://t.co/AKpJIDztv1 pic.twitter.com/7JzEngSkqpSo far in the tri-state, there have been no confirmed cases of the illness that has now been found on every continent except Antarctica. NYC Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot says that due to the federal government expanding its criteria for virus testing to include Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea, more people are expected to be tested.\"Viruses don\u2019t respect borders and this broader definition will help us cast a wider net to detect the virus. We expect the number of cases under investigation to grow,\" Barbot said.New York City's Bellevue Hospital is one of several local medical centers that are preparing for a possible outbreak. It is home to 1,200 beds that could be readily available in case the virus becomes widespread, according to Mayor de Blasio.We ask New Yorkers to continue to wash their hands regularly and stay home if they feel sick and have recently traveled or been in close contact with someone who has traveled to these or any countries with ongoing person-to-person spread of COVID-19: https://t.co/Cb8O3dXUFhAs of Friday night, there were at least two cases of novel coronavirus in the United States believed to have been transmitted to a person who didn\u2019t travel internationally or come in close contact with anyone who had it.That first patient, a woman in California, was put in isolation and on a ventilator at UC Davis Medical Center. She did not have any contact with any people who are known to be infected, either. Her testing was initially delayed for days because she didn't meet federal criteria.Previously, there were more than 60 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the U.S., most of which stemmed from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.While health experts maintain that the risk of getting the COVID-19 virus is low, spread of the illness is inevitable.",

(WPRI) \u2013 The Rhode Island Department of Health has confirmed a person in their 40s who recently traveled to Italy in mid-February has a presumptive positive case of coronavirus \u2013 the first in the Ocean State.RIDOH said the person is being treated at the hospital and that all infection control protocols are being followed, but did not elaborate on which hospital is treating the patient.According to the department of health, the patient\u2019s immediate family members have quarantined themselves since the person started showing symptoms after traveling abroad.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevent is tracking down the people who were on the person\u2019s return flight to the United States from Italy. We\u2019re told the person did not return to work since coming back from Italy and had limited travel through Rhode Island.RIDOH is reaching out to people who were in direct contact with this patient. Those people will undergo a 14 day quarantine, monitoring themselves for symptoms.\u201cThe Rhode Island Department of Health has been preparing for weeks to ensure that w have a structure in place to, to the best of our ability, limit or prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Rhode Island. We fully anticipated having a first case of COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott, the head of RIDOH. She added that they are not seeing widespread comunity transmission and that the risk in the state is still low.RIDOH is asking people to wash their hands regularly, cover their mouths and noses when coughing an sneezing, and staying home if they\u2019re sick.The State Health Laboratories have worked to be able to test for COVID-19 (coronavirus) here in Rhode Island. The state successfully ran the tests that identified this first case of coronavirus in Rhode Island, without having to wait for results to come back from the CDC. However, according to a press release, RIDOH said each \u201cpresumptive\u201d positive test result must still be confirmed by the CDC.Health experts are encouraging anyone showing symptoms of coronavirus (fever, cough, shortness of breath) to contact a doctor and call ahead before going to a doctor\u2019s office. Experts say you can help prevent its spread, and the spread of other viruses, by washing your hands, covering your coughs and sneezes, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, keep surfaces clean, and get your flu shot.Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

            "main_text": "Note: The COVID-19 outbreak unfolding in the United States may affect healthcare seeking behavior which in turn would impact data from ILINet.Flu activity as reported by clinical laboratories remains high but decreased for the fourth week in a row; however, influenza-like illness activity increased slightly.\u00a0 Severity indicators remain moderate to low overall, but hospitalization rates differ by age group, with high rates among children and young adults.The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza at clinical laboratories decreased from 26.1% last week to 21.5% this week.Nationally, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are now the most commonly reported influenza viruses this season.Genetic and antigenic characterization and antiviral susceptibility of influenza viruses collected in the U.S. are summarized in this report.Visits to health care providers for influenza-like illness (ILI) increased slightly from 5.1% last week to 5.2% this week. All regions remain above their baselines.The number of jurisdictions experiencing high ILI activity increased slightly from 42 last week to 43 this week.The number of jurisdictions reporting regional or widespread influenza activity decreased from 51 last week to 50 this week.The overall cumulative hospitalization rate for the season increased to 61.6 per 100,000.The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza is 7.1%, below the epidemic threshold of 7.3%.8 influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2019-2020 season were reported this week. The total for the season is 144.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC influenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each data component is available on the surveillance methods page.Additional information on the current and previous influenza seasons for each surveillance component are available on FluView Interactive.Key PointsThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.  Data from clinical laboratories (the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for influenza) are used to monitor whether influenza activity is increasing or decreasing.The results of tests performed by public health laboratories nationwide are summarized below.  Data from public health laboratories are used to monitor the proportion of circulating viruses that belong to each influenza subtype/lineage.While influenza B/Victoria viruses predominated earlier in the season, during recent weeks, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have been reported more frequently than B/Victoria viruses nationally and in all surveillance regions. For the season, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are the predominant virus nationally.  Regional and state level data about circulating influenza viruses can be found on FluView Interactive.The predominant virus also varies by age group. Nationally, for the season overall, influenza B viruses are the most commonly reported influenza viruses among children and young adults less than 25 years, while A viruses are the most commonly reported influenza viruses among persons 25 years and older.  In the most recent three weeks, influenza A viruses are the most commonly reported influenza viruses in all age groups.Additional virologic surveillance information for current and past seasons:\nSurveillance Methods | FluView Interactive: National, Regional, and State Data or Age DataCDC performs genetic and antigenic characterization of U.S. viruses submitted from state and local health laboratories using Right Size Roadmap submission guidance. These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating influenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new influenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionary changes that continually occur in circulating influenza viruses. Antigenic characterization data are based on an animal model (influenza-naive ferrets), and do not reflect pre-existing protection provided by past influenza infections and vaccinations. Additional antigenic characterization studies involving people vaccinated with current influenza vaccines are conducted later in the season; these data account for pre-existing protection in different populations against circulating influenza viruses.  Genetic and antigenic characterization data are not used to make calculations about vaccine effectiveness (VE). CDC conducts VE studies each year to measure the benefits of flu vaccines in people. Interim estimates of 2019-2020 flu vaccine effectiveness have been released.CDC genetically characterized 2,065 influenza viruses collected in the U.S. from September 29, 2019, to March 7, 2020.CDC antigenically characterizes a subset of influenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) or neutralization based Focus Reduction assays (FRA). Antigenic drift is evaluated by comparing antigenic properties of cell-propagated reference viruses representing currently recommended vaccine components with those of cell-propagated circulating viruses.  CDC antigenically characterized 403 influenza viruses collected in the United States from September 29, 2019, to March 7, 2020. These data are not used to make calculations about vaccine effectiveness (VE). CDC conducts VE studies each year to measure the benefits of flu vaccines in people.Influenza A Viruses\n\nA (H1N1)pdm09: 153 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized by HI with ferret antisera, and 123 (80.4%) were antigenically similar (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) to cell-propagated A/Brisbane/02/2018-like reference viruses representing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the 2019-20 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. The decrease in the percent of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses similar to A/Brisbane/02/2018 is due to some of the recent viruses selected for testing having a single amino acid change that is antigenically distinguishable in antigenic assays using ferret sera. Similar viruses were observed last season as well and these represented a small proportion of virus circulating.  We have observed an increase in the proportion of H1N1pdm09 viruses with this change late in the US season. \nA (H3N2): 76 A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized by FRA with ferret antisera, and 31 (40.8%) were antigenically similar to cell-propagated A/Kansas/14/2017-like reference viruses representing the A(H3N2) component for the 2019-20 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines.Influenza B Viruses\n\nB/Victoria: 146 B/Victoria lineage viruses, including viruses from both co-circulating sub-clades, were antigenically characterized by HI with ferret antisera, and 95 (65.1%) were antigenically similar to cell-propagated B/Colorado/06/2017-like reference viruses representing the B/Victoria component for the 2019-20 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines.\nB/Yamagata: 28 B/Yamagata lineage viruses were antigenically characterized by HI with ferret antisera, and all 28 (100%) were antigenically similar to cell-propagated B/Phuket/3073/2013-like reference viruses representing the B/Yamagata component for the 2019-20 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines.CDC also assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to the antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using next generation sequence analysis supplemented by laboratory assays. Viruses collected in the United States since September 29, 2019, were tested for antiviral susceptibility as follows:*Six influenza viruses showed reduced or highly reduced inhibition by at least one neuraminidase inhibitor. Four A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses showed highly reduced inhibition to oseltamivir and peramivir while showing normal inhibition to zanamivir. In addition, one B/Victoria virus showed highly reduced inhibition to peramivir and reduced inhibition to oseltamivir and zanamivir, while another influenza B/Victoria virus showed reduced inhibition to zanamivir.A total of 556 additional viruses (211 A(H1N1)pdm09, 32 A(H3N2), and 313 B) collected in Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia and Wisconsin were analyzed for resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors by pyrosequencing assay.  Three (1.4%) of the 211 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses tested had the H275Y amino acid substitution in the neuraminidase and showed highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir.  No molecular markers associated with reduced or highly reduced inhibition by neuraminidase inhibitors were detected in A(H3N2) and type B viruses tested.Nationwide during week 10, 5.2% of patient visits reported through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) were due to influenza-like illness (ILI). This percentage is above the national baseline of 2.4%.On a regional level, the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI ranged from 3.9% to 8.4% during week 10. All regions reported a percentage of outpatient visits for ILI above their region-specific baselines. Regions 2, 7, and 10 reported the greatest increases in ILI relative to their baselines. Clinical laboratories in regions 2 and 10 reported a decrease in influenza virus circulation; however, these are areas of the country where COVID-19 is most prevalent and more people may be seeking care for respiratory illness than usual at this time.  The ILI increase in region 7 appears most likely due to low reporting.Data collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity* by state.During week 10, the following ILI activity levels were experienced:*Data collected in ILINet may disproportionally represent certain populations within a state, and therefore, may not accurately depict the full picture of influenza activity for the whole state. Differences in the data presented here by CDC and independently by some state health departments likely represent differing levels of data completeness with data presented by the state likely being the more complete.Additional information about medically attended visits for ILI for current and past seasons:\nSurveillance Methods | FluView Interactive: National, Regional, and State Data or ILI Activity MapThe influenza activity reported by state and territorial epidemiologists indicates geographic spread of influenza viruses but does not measure the severity of influenza activity.During week 10, the following influenza activity was reported:Additional geographic spread surveillance information for current and past seasons:\nSurveillance Methods | FluView InteractiveThe Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in select counties in the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) states and Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP) states.A total of 17,889 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites between October 1, 2019 and March 7, 2020; 12,652 (70.7%) were associated with influenza A virus, 5,140 (28.7%) with influenza B virus, 50 (0.3%) with influenza A virus and influenza B virus co-infection, and 47 (0.3%) with influenza virus for which the type was not determined. Among those with influenza A subtype information, 3,391 (94.2%) were A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and 207 (5.8%) were A(H3N2).The overall cumulative hospitalization rate was 61.6 per 100,000 population which is higher than all recent seasons at this time of year except for the 2017-18 season. Rates in children 0-4 years old and adults 18-49 years old are now the highest CDC has on record for these age groups, surpassing the rate reported during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Hospitalization rates for school-aged children are higher than any recent regular season but lower than rates during the pandemic.The highest rate of hospitalization is among adults aged \u2265 65, followed by children aged 0-4 years and adults aged 50-64 years.Among 2,867 hospitalized adults with information on underlying medical conditions, 92.3% had at least one reported underlying medical condition, the most commonly reported were cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorder, obesity, and chronic lung disease. Among 472 hospitalized children with information on underlying medical conditions, 48.3% had at least one underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported was asthma. Among 477 hospitalized women of childbearing age (15-44 years) with information on pregnancy status, 27.5% were pregnant.View Full ScreenAdditional hospitalization surveillance information for current and past seasons and additional age groups:\n\nSurveillance Methods | FluView Interactive: Rates by Age or  Patient CharacteristicsBased on National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) mortality surveillance data available on March 12, 2020, 7.1% of the deaths occurring during the week ending February 29, 2020 (week 9) were due to P&I. This percentage is below the epidemic threshold of 7.3% for week 9.Additional pneumonia and influenza mortality surveillance information for current and past seasons: \nSurveillance Methods | FluView InteractiveEight influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2019-2020 season between weeks 6 and 10 (the weeks ending February 8, 2020 and March 7, 2020) were reported to CDC during week 10. Three were associated with influenza B viruses; one had a lineage determined and was a B/Victoria virus. Five were associated with influenza A viruses, and three were subtyped; all were A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.Of the 144 influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2019-2020 season and reported to CDC:\n\n96 deaths were associated with influenza B viruses, and 20 had a lineage determined; all were B/Victoria viruses.\n48 deaths were associated with influenza A viruses, and 27 were subtyped; 26 were A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and one was an A(H3) virus.Additional pediatric mortality surveillance information for current and past seasons:Surveillance Methods | FluView InteractiveAdditional National and International Influenza Surveillance Information \nFluView Interactive: FluView includes enhanced web-based interactive applications that can provide dynamic visuals of the influenza data collected and analyzed by CDC.

            "main_text": "\u00a9 Copyright 2019 St. Joseph Communications.HealthThe chance to contain COVID-19 has passed. What will Canada do when it hits our cities, schools and hospitals?By Aaron Hutchins and Marie-Danielle Smith\n\n February 28, 2020Paramedics transport a man believed to be Hong Kong\u2019s first COVID-19 case, in January (Lam Yik Fei/The New York Times/Redux Pictures)Dr. Vanessa Allen received a text in late January from the medical director for infection prevention and control at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto. He needed to chat.Allen is chief of medical microbiology at Public Health Ontario\u2019s laboratory, which had recently started testing samples for the 2019 novel coronavirus, all of which had come back negative to that point. Jerome Leis at Sunnybrook was getting in touch because he had a case on its way that would likely be different.A 56-year-old man had arrived at Sunnybrook that day with a fever and dry cough. The patient had just returned from a three-month visit to Wuhan, China, leaving two days before the Chinese government shut down the city\u2019s buses, trains, ferries and airport. An X-ray of his lungs showed results consistent with a viral pneumonia.April 2020 cover of Maclean\u2019s magazineThe lab stayed open all night working on the specimen; they needed to be absolutely sure one way or the other. Fortunately, Chinese scientists had already determined the genetic code for the new coronavirus and shared the results internationally. \u201cDuring SARS [in 2003], it took us more than four months to figure out what the virus was,\u201d Allen says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a test. We didn\u2019t know who had it and who didn\u2019t.\u201dAllen describes the test for the new coronavirus, known as COVID-19, as being akin to making photocopies of the genetic code in the patient\u2019s sample, and amplifying it to see if it matches the genetic code of the novel coronavirus. In the case in question, the results confirmed the suspicion: both nose and throat swab samples from the patient came back positive. The 2019 novel coronavirus was officially in Canada.***China first reported the coronavirus to the World Health Organization (WHO) on New Year\u2019s Eve, and despite the communist government\u2019s effective quarantine of Wuhan\u2014the city of 11 million people at the epicentre of the outbreak\u2014the virus has spread to every continent except Antarctica. As of late February, mainland China has more than 78,000 confirmed cases, and more than 2,700 deaths. The virus has reached at least 55 countries and people have died of the infection in Iran, Italy, France, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines.Cases that cannot be linked to a patient in China are cropping up around the world, in places as disparate as Iran and Italy. In Germany and the United States, there are now confirmed cases that have no known link to someone or somewhere with COVID-19, raising alarm bells that the virus could already be spreading locally.READ: A made-in-Canada solution to the coronavirus outbreak?Whatever chance there might have been to contain the virus, such that it was traceable to its origin point in Wuhan, seems to have passed.Canadians, meanwhile, have repeatedly been told by government officials that the risk to the public remains low in this country. But that\u2019s a bit misleading, says Michael Gardam, an infectious disease specialist and chief of staff at Toronto\u2019s Humber River Hospital. Or, at least in light of COVID-19\u2019s spread, short-sighted. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re on the beach and you can see a tidal wave coming in the distance. It\u2019s not here yet,\u201d says Gardam. \u201cAt this very moment, the risk on the beach is low. But we know that\u2019s soon going to change.\u201dGardam\u2019s message to the public would be more nuanced: the risk is low, but given recent outbreaks in Iran and Italy\u2014which have caused the virus to spread across parts of Europe and the Middle East\u2014it\u2019s unlikely Canada will stay in this position for much longer.And while the WHO won\u2019t call COVID-19 a pandemic just yet, Gardam argues it would probably be best for Canada to consider it one. \u201cWe\u2019re fooling ourselves if we think we\u2019re going to stop this, so let\u2019s shift our thinking to how we best slow down the spread,\u201d he says. \u201cBy declaring a pandemic, it sends the message that if it\u2019s not everywhere, it will be.\u201dInvestors have already made that assumption. A sharp market downturn in late February was widely attributed to coronavirus fears, while biotech firms trying to develop a vaccine saw their stocks soar.As anxiety rises across the globe, there are other practicalities to consider. If and when a wider outbreak reaches Canada, we can expect a surge of patients at emergency rooms, an increased demand for lab testing, and a need for more hospital beds. How prepared are we for the tidal wave of COVID-19?***Around the time Vanessa Allen\u2019s lab confirmed that the Sunnybrook patient did indeed have COVID-19, Toronto Public Health officials were trying to contact those who had been in direct or indirect contact with the man.\u201cIt\u2019s an hour-by-hour account, detective work, to find out what sorts of activities they\u2019ve been doing, where and with whom, since they\u2019ve been ill,\u201d explains Dr. Eileen de Villa, Toronto\u2019s medical officer of health, offering a hypothetical example of the work her team does when any patient with an infectious disease is identified. \u201cWhere were you sitting on the plane? Did you go to the washroom? How much did you walk around? How did you get home from the airport? What did you do when you got home? Were people at your home when you arrived? Did you go to the grocery store to restock your fridge?\u201d\u2018During SARS,\u2019 says Allen, \u2018it took us more than four months to figure out what the virus was\u2019 (Photograph by Kate Dockeray)Within hours of the first positive COVID-19 test result, a media press conference featuring politicians and representatives from Sunnybrook, Public Health Ontario and Toronto Public Health was convened. This type of transparency and communication from various health organizations has helped make Canada the second-least vulnerable nation in the world to outbreaks, based on the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI)\u2014a 2016 research project created by the non-profit Rand Corporation in the aftermath of the Ebola and Zika virus outbreaks, which identifies countries most and least capable of handling outbreaks\u2014trailing only Norway. And this position on the index is partly a reflection of the measures taken to improve preparedness in the wake of the 2003 SARS outbreak, which killed 44 people in Canada.READ: Has coronavirus become a pandemic?Back then, Sunnybrook had three members in its hospital infection control program, Leis says. Now they have 15. In 2003, the emergency department had one ventilation system, where air circulated throughout the entire department. Now, there are multiple zones with separate air circulation systems, and each zone has at least one negative-pressure room with its own circulation to the outside.When there are suspected cases of an infectious disease, hospital staff have personal protective equipment at their disposal\u2014masks, face shields, gloves\u2014to protect them from virtually any high-consequence pathogen, \u201ceven the new ones that we don\u2019t know about yet,\u201d Leis says. Portable X-rays mean a patient doesn\u2019t need to travel through the hospital for radiology. Even food trays for such patients are disposable, minimizing the need for staff to enter and exit the room.The triage team keeps an active list of dangerous pathogens circulating in different parts of the world, allowing timely investigation based on a patient\u2019s travel history. The list of countries of concern is updated daily.All of this will stand Canada in good stead when patients do start coming to the hospital in greater numbers. The fact that China imposed large-scale quarantines\u2014the \u201clargest restrictions over the greatest number of people in the history of humankind,\u201d says Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto\u2019s University Health Network\u2014may also prove to be a mitigating factor. \u201cThat bought the world several weeks to prepare for widespread global transmission of this infection. Hopefully governments and health ministers used that time wisely.\u201dOn Feb. 19, the daily number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally dropped from thousands to hundreds. Meanwhile, the daily number of newly recovered patients was in the thousands. It might have appeared that the worst of the virus was behind us.But then two people died in Iran that same day, the first fatalities in the Middle East. And then, on Feb. 20, more bad news: In what British Columbia\u2019s provincial health officer called a \u201csentinel event,\u201d a patient was diagnosed as Canada\u2019s ninth person to contract the novel coronavirus. What made this case especially noteworthy is that the patient had never been to China. She had, however, recently returned from a trip to Iran.***On Valentine\u2019s Day, a woman in her 30s boarded an Air Canada flight from Montreal to Vancouver. It was the final leg of her trip home after visiting family north of Tehran.Somewhere on her long journey to Canada, she started to feel sick. A couple days later, her symptoms\u2014fever, cough, headache and general fatigue\u2014were serious enough to bring her to the emergency department. \u201cShe was concerned she might have been in contact with somebody who was sick,\u201d says Bonnie Henry, B.C.\u2019s provincial health officer.The young woman figured it was probably the flu. The doctor who saw her did, too. There was no real reason to suspect COVID-19\u2014the patient hadn\u2019t been anywhere close to anyone who had travelled to China, let alone Wuhan. At least, not that she knew of. Iran didn\u2019t even have a single confirmed case of COVID-19 at the time the patient first presented in emergency.READ: Coronavirus: The worst-case scenarioBut because she had been travelling internationally, the doctor treating her figured it might be worthwhile to test for COVID-19\u2014just in case.When the test came back positive, Henry thought it must be a mistake. \u201cI thought this could be MERS [Middle East Respiratory Syndrome] because it was circulating in that part of the world,\u201d says Henry. But a MERS test came back negative.\u201cThe clinician essentially had a hunch\u2014so it was a bit of a fluke,\u201d Henry says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re thankful, because it allowed us to contain this before it spread to too many people.\u201dThrough the Public Health Agency of Canada, the case was reported to the WHO. Within days, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates confirmed cases of COVID-19 in patients who had recently travelled to Iran. Soon, there were 43 confirmed cases in Iran, with eight deaths.The numbers set off red flags with Ashleigh Tuite, an epidemiologist and adjunct lecturer at the University of Toronto\u2019s Dalla Lana School of Public Health. For starters, China had reported a mortality rate of about two per cent, whereas almost 20 per cent of reported cases had been fatal in Iran. Not to mention, \u201cwith COVID-19, it normally takes a matter of weeks until someone dies,\u201d Tuite says. \u201cSo if you\u2019re seeing deaths reported, those people had been infected for presumably three weeks.\u201dPlus Iran has relatively little outbound air travel to Lebanon or Canada, at least not compared to countries like Iraq, Syria and Azerbaijan\u2014which at the time had zero confirmed cases of COVID-19. The math didn\u2019t add up.Based on the virus\u2019s dispersion from Iran to the U.A.E., Lebanon and Canada, Tuite and a handful of Toronto-based researchers crunched the numbers of Iran\u2019s outgoing international airline travel volume in an effort to figure out the likely scale of the epidemic in Iran.Their findings: Iran likely didn\u2019t have tens of cases of COVID-19, as was officially reported. It probably had somewhere closer to 18,300.Within days, the countries of Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan all had confirmed cases of COVID-19 stemming from people who had recently travelled to Iran.And only a day after the Iranian deputy health minister coughed and sweated his way through a press conference denying claims his government was covering up the scale of the outbreak, he tested positive for COVID-19 and went into self-isolation.A pedestrian in Beijing has his temperature checked (Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)***Around the same time that a patient without any ties to China was diagnosed in Canada, the U.S. had a similar case in its sights\u2014a person in California who hadn\u2019t recently travelled or been exposed to someone with confirmed COVID-19. Although doctors considered the novel coronavirus to be a possible diagnosis for the Californian\u2019s symptoms, they had to wait days for confirmation because of narrow criteria set by the U.S. federal agency responsible for administering tests. How far could COVID-19 have spread in that time? It\u2019s tough to know for sure. The virus is thought to spread from person to person\u2014be it via close contact or what are known as \u201crespiratory droplets,\u201d when someone coughs or sneezes. And its \u201cR naught\u201d rate\u2014which estimates the number of healthy people a single contagious person would infect\u2014is estimated to be between two and three, which is worse than the seasonal flu but not nearly as bad as measles. Meanwhile, symptoms like fever, cough and trouble breathing could take upwards of 14 days to appear.As for how deadly it might become, a Chinese report from mid-February found the case-fatality rate of COVID-19 to be just over two per cent, which if accurate would put COVID-19 on par with the Spanish flu, the 1918 pandemic estimated to have killed at least 50 million people worldwide.RELATED: \u2018It felt like the end of the world\u2019: From Wuhan to Canada in coronavirus quarantineBut experts have been skeptical of the data. To start, Chinese hospitals had been so overwhelmed with sick patients that it\u2019s very plausible that many COVID-19 cases in the region went undetected, because their symptoms were so mild that people didn\u2019t go to hospital. There are also questions about China\u2019s transparency, particularly in light of the fact that Chinese officials initially tried to silence the doctor who had first warned his colleagues about the potential virus. (He died of the coronavirus weeks later.)Without a better sense of the denominator\u2014or the total number of COVID-19 cases, including the most mild\u2014it\u2019s tough to know the fatality rate.What we do know is the daily increase in cases outside mainland China is now outpacing the number of cases within. And the death count is growing. In just over a week in late February, South Korea went from having 30 cases to 2,330, including 13 deaths. Seventeen more were dead in Italy, as of press time. Iran\u2019s death count soon totalled 34. And strings of new cases have emerged in Singapore, Kuwait, Germany, Bahrain and Australia.As soon as the first reports of the novel coronavirus started coming out of China, Isaac Bogoch knew it would only be a matter of time before the virus spread. That\u2019s because, globally speaking, we\u2019re still extremely vulnerable to outbreaks, Bogoch says, and a major reason why is the world\u2019s growing interconnectedness via travel, tourism and trade. \u201cAny person on earth can be at just about any other place on the planet in about 24 hours.\u201dTo get a sense of how international travel could impact the spread of this coronavirus, Bogoch analyzed passenger loads and destinations from 10 major Chinese cities, using data from a three-month period in early 2019. He coupled that data with each country\u2019s corresponding IDVI score.Cambodia\u2014a nation that receives hundreds of thousands of travellers from China, and also has a poor IDVI score\u2014has only one confirmed case of coronavirus as of press time. Similarly, all of Africa, which does $200 billion worth of trade with China annually, has only three confirmed cases.It\u2019s unlikely these regions are simply lucky. \u201cSome of these countries don\u2019t have the capacity for case detection or case management,\u201d Bogoch says. \u201cAnd what happens over there can affect us here [in Canada]. We saw that with Ebola, chikungunya, Zika, SARS, MERS. It\u2019s going to happen again.\u201d***The world is not ready for this pandemic. At least not according to Canadian epidemiologist Bruce Aylward. Upon his return from a two-week mission to China on behalf of the WHO, Aylward commended the Chinese for their aggressive approach to containing and treating COVID-19 patients, while suggesting other countries equally prepare for larger-scale quarantines for people who come in contact with a person testing positive for COVID-19.After the SARS crisis in 2003, the federal government equipped itself with sweeping powers in the event of a disease outbreak. The Quarantine Act, passed in 2005, allows Canada\u2019s health minister to, among other things, divert travelling passengers or cargo, enforce mandatory medical screening and deem any place a \u201cquarantine station\u201d or \u201cfacility\u201d\u2014a private home, a hospital, a hotel, you name it. It allows for strict penalties, including fines up to $1 million and jail time, for people who fail to comply or who endanger others. This was the law that enabled the mandatory quarantine of those the Canadian government flew back from Wuhan.Does the act allow for putting under quarantine places like a school, an apartment building, a city block, a neighbourhood, a town, a suburb or a city? \u201cIf the public health rationale is sufficiently strong, then yes, they could,\u201d explains Steven Hoffman, a global health and law professor at York University and the scientific director of the Institute of Population and Public Health at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. \u201cThe key being that it can\u2019t just be this mass thing that\u2019s limiting a whole lot of Canadians\u2019 rights to liberty merely to contain a few people who are actually posing that risk.\u201dREAD: The science of novel coronavirusBut a city-wide quarantine is inconceivable in the Canadian context, he says. Courts would likely find it unconstitutional. \u201cIt would likely be more in a precision way, focusing on individuals who are at risk of spreading something as opposed to the rather draconian mass quarantines that we would see in China,\u201d Hoffman says.If there is a surge of cases in Canada, public health authorities can be expected to start giving the kind of advice that\u2019s helpful to prevent the flu. Wash your hands. Cough into your elbow. Stay home if you\u2019re sick. \u201cPublic health authorities may encourage people to voluntarily reduce the number of mass gatherings,\u201d says Hoffman, like work conferences.With the number of cases surpassing 200 in Japan, in addition to the more than 700 cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off its coast, that country\u2019s prime minister announced in late February that all schools would be shut for a month to help contain the virus\u2019s spread. \u201cLots of studies show how few people we actually interact with on a daily basis,\u201d says Hoffman. \u201cSchools are where a lot of those different social networks intersect, such that it could be a place where spread could be enabled.\u201dEmergency workers in Japan exit the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship on Feb. 10 (Carl Court/Getty Images)As of late February, Hoffman would put school shutdowns in the category of \u201cgovernment overreaction.\u201d But, he adds, \u201cif a city in Canada faces a huge surge and it\u2019s felt to be uncontrollable, you could imagine schools being temporarily closed,\u201d he says, through government intervention. Still, it\u2019s more likely that schools, workplaces or communities will ask for people to stay home voluntarily as the perceived risk of infection rises. \u201cSome of the research shows that, when people are asked to self-quarantine, there are extremely high rates of compliance.\u201dPublic health agencies have so far been focused on trying to keep people calm. But with stories emerging that suggest a wider spread of the virus is inevitable, public health officials will be at pains to assure people they have plenty of mitigation plans in place. \u201cWe do want the public to know we aren\u2019t just sitting around waiting for new people to test positive,\u201d says Chris Shewchuk, a spokesman for the B.C. health ministry. While trying not to prompt survivalist hauls from grocery stores, public health agencies will want people to consider how they might handle being asked to spend a couple of weeks at home riding out mild symptoms. Whether they can work from home. What it might mean for their loved ones or pets. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to say, \u2018go buy cases of water,\u2019\u2009\u201d Shewchuk says. \u201cIt\u2019s very different from saying we need you to be able to, I don\u2019t know, have enough canned beans.\u201dSo far, patients in Canada with COVID-19 have voluntarily agreed to go into self-isolation at home, where local authorities can check in via phone to monitor them and ask them to check their own temperatures. But if cases become more severe\u2014among elderly people with pre-existing heart or lung conditions who are most at risk, for example\u2014that won\u2019t always be an option.And as the number of infections grow, the health care system needs protocols around how best to manage patients presenting with symptoms, and how best to treat those who test positive.For Gardam, the biggest concern is that Canadian hospitals are routinely running over 100 per cent capacity, especially during flu season. \u201cThere is no room for extra people,\u201d he says\u2014not to mention that a significant portion of hospital beds are currently being used by elderly patients who do not need acute care, but aren\u2019t well enough to go home. \u201cIt\u2019s well-known we need tens of thousands of new nursing-home beds, and we\u2019re not going to build those in three months,\u201d he says.Temporary hospital beds await patients in an exhibition centre in Wuhan, China, on Feb. 4 (AFP/Getty Images)To accommodate the influx, Humber River Hospital officials are already discussing the possibility of having to postpone elective surgeries by months, or even more than a year. Monthly check-ins might be delayed to every two months. Anything to open up another room, or another bed.Then there are potential equipment shortages, where supply could be limited based on other countries facing similar outbreaks. \u201cMost N95 respirators are made in China or the U.S.,\u201d Gardam says. \u201cWe\u2019ve stockpiled more than most countries, but if your stockpile runs out, you could have difficulty getting more equipment.\u201dAnd while plenty of hospitals have the resources to test for influenza, that\u2019s not the case with COVID-19. \u201cIn Ontario, it\u2019s basically all done at the Public Health Lab in downtown Toronto,\u201d Gardam says. \u201cIf we start testing widely, that lab will be overwhelmed.\u201dWith backlogs in testing and overcrowded hospital rooms, many people with mild symptoms might feel less compelled to get themselves checked out. \u201cHow many people in China or Italy have a sore throat and think: \u2018I\u2019m not going to the hospital. I might catch it in the waiting room\u2019?\u201d asks Gardam.And there are still several unknowns, says epidemiologist Timothy Sly, including whether the virus can spread via the asymptomatic\u2014meaning people who present no symptoms at all. \u201cThey could be on the bus, in the cinema or at school,\u201d says the professor at the school of public health at Ryerson University. \u201cAnd they could be spreading it around.\u201dBased on COVID-19\u2019s transmission rates, one WHO adviser estimated two-thirds of the world\u2019s population could get this virus. And even if the transmission rate is cut in half, that\u2019s still roughly one-third of people getting infected.As it stands, Gardam says it\u2019s not overly dramatic to tell anyone they\u2019re likely to get the coronavirus\u2014even in Canada. \u201cThis is a new virus, so presumably none of us have any good immunity to it. With a lack of immunity, why wouldn\u2019t we get it?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe odds are good that I\u2019m going to catch this. The odds are good that you\u2019re going to catch this. And chances are we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d In fact, a huge chunk of the population might not even realize they get it.But then there\u2019s that very small percentage of the population, mostly the elderly, who won\u2019t be fine. If COVID-19 spreads across Canada, infecting half the population, and the virus has a mortality rate of even a fraction of one per cent, tens of thousands of Canadians would die.\u201cIf you think back to what happened during the Spanish flu, every person had a story of a family member who died,\u201d Gardam says. \u201cIt\u2019s possible we could be getting into that scenario.\u201dThis article appears in print in the April 2020 issue of Maclean\u2019s magazine with the headline, \u201cA planet infected.\u201d Subscribe to the monthly print magazine here.\u00a9 Copyright 2019 St. Joseph Communications.",

            "main_text": "\u00a9 Copyright 2019 St. Joseph Communications.HealthThe chance to contain COVID-19 has passed. What will Canada do when it hits our cities, schools and hospitals?By Aaron Hutchins and Marie-Danielle Smith\n\n February 28, 2020Paramedics transport a man believed to be Hong Kong\u2019s first COVID-19 case, in January (Lam Yik Fei/The New York Times/Redux Pictures)Dr. Vanessa Allen received a text in late January from the medical director for infection prevention and control at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto. He needed to chat.Allen is chief of medical microbiology at Public Health Ontario\u2019s laboratory, which had recently started testing samples for the 2019 novel coronavirus, all of which had come back negative to that point. Jerome Leis at Sunnybrook was getting in touch because he had a case on its way that would likely be different.A 56-year-old man had arrived at Sunnybrook that day with a fever and dry cough. The patient had just returned from a three-month visit to Wuhan, China, leaving two days before the Chinese government shut down the city\u2019s buses, trains, ferries and airport. An X-ray of his lungs showed results consistent with a viral pneumonia.April 2020 cover of Maclean\u2019s magazineThe lab stayed open all night working on the specimen; they needed to be absolutely sure one way or the other. Fortunately, Chinese scientists had already determined the genetic code for the new coronavirus and shared the results internationally. \u201cDuring SARS [in 2003], it took us more than four months to figure out what the virus was,\u201d Allen says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a test. We didn\u2019t know who had it and who didn\u2019t.\u201dAllen describes the test for the new coronavirus, known as COVID-19, as being akin to making photocopies of the genetic code in the patient\u2019s sample, and amplifying it to see if it matches the genetic code of the novel coronavirus. In the case in question, the results confirmed the suspicion: both nose and throat swab samples from the patient came back positive. The 2019 novel coronavirus was officially in Canada.***China first reported the coronavirus to the World Health Organization (WHO) on New Year\u2019s Eve, and despite the communist government\u2019s effective quarantine of Wuhan\u2014the city of 11 million people at the epicentre of the outbreak\u2014the virus has spread to every continent except Antarctica. As of late February, mainland China has more than 78,000 confirmed cases, and more than 2,700 deaths. The virus has reached at least 55 countries and people have died of the infection in Iran, Italy, France, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines.Cases that cannot be linked to a patient in China are cropping up around the world, in places as disparate as Iran and Italy. In Germany and the United States, there are now confirmed cases that have no known link to someone or somewhere with COVID-19, raising alarm bells that the virus could already be spreading locally.READ: A made-in-Canada solution to the coronavirus outbreak?Whatever chance there might have been to contain the virus, such that it was traceable to its origin point in Wuhan, seems to have passed.Canadians, meanwhile, have repeatedly been told by government officials that the risk to the public remains low in this country. But that\u2019s a bit misleading, says Michael Gardam, an infectious disease specialist and chief of staff at Toronto\u2019s Humber River Hospital. Or, at least in light of COVID-19\u2019s spread, short-sighted. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re on the beach and you can see a tidal wave coming in the distance. It\u2019s not here yet,\u201d says Gardam. \u201cAt this very moment, the risk on the beach is low. But we know that\u2019s soon going to change.\u201dGardam\u2019s message to the public would be more nuanced: the risk is low, but given recent outbreaks in Iran and Italy\u2014which have caused the virus to spread across parts of Europe and the Middle East\u2014it\u2019s unlikely Canada will stay in this position for much longer.And while the WHO won\u2019t call COVID-19 a pandemic just yet, Gardam argues it would probably be best for Canada to consider it one. \u201cWe\u2019re fooling ourselves if we think we\u2019re going to stop this, so let\u2019s shift our thinking to how we best slow down the spread,\u201d he says. \u201cBy declaring a pandemic, it sends the message that if it\u2019s not everywhere, it will be.\u201dInvestors have already made that assumption. A sharp market downturn in late February was widely attributed to coronavirus fears, while biotech firms trying to develop a vaccine saw their stocks soar.As anxiety rises across the globe, there are other practicalities to consider. If and when a wider outbreak reaches Canada, we can expect a surge of patients at emergency rooms, an increased demand for lab testing, and a need for more hospital beds. How prepared are we for the tidal wave of COVID-19?***Around the time Vanessa Allen\u2019s lab confirmed that the Sunnybrook patient did indeed have COVID-19, Toronto Public Health officials were trying to contact those who had been in direct or indirect contact with the man.\u201cIt\u2019s an hour-by-hour account, detective work, to find out what sorts of activities they\u2019ve been doing, where and with whom, since they\u2019ve been ill,\u201d explains Dr. Eileen de Villa, Toronto\u2019s medical officer of health, offering a hypothetical example of the work her team does when any patient with an infectious disease is identified. \u201cWhere were you sitting on the plane? Did you go to the washroom? How much did you walk around? How did you get home from the airport? What did you do when you got home? Were people at your home when you arrived? Did you go to the grocery store to restock your fridge?\u201d\u2018During SARS,\u2019 says Allen, \u2018it took us more than four months to figure out what the virus was\u2019 (Photograph by Kate Dockeray)Within hours of the first positive COVID-19 test result, a media press conference featuring politicians and representatives from Sunnybrook, Public Health Ontario and Toronto Public Health was convened. This type of transparency and communication from various health organizations has helped make Canada the second-least vulnerable nation in the world to outbreaks, based on the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI)\u2014a 2016 research project created by the non-profit Rand Corporation in the aftermath of the Ebola and Zika virus outbreaks, which identifies countries most and least capable of handling outbreaks\u2014trailing only Norway. And this position on the index is partly a reflection of the measures taken to improve preparedness in the wake of the 2003 SARS outbreak, which killed 44 people in Canada.READ: Has coronavirus become a pandemic?Back then, Sunnybrook had three members in its hospital infection control program, Leis says. Now they have 15. In 2003, the emergency department had one ventilation system, where air circulated throughout the entire department. Now, there are multiple zones with separate air circulation systems, and each zone has at least one negative-pressure room with its own circulation to the outside.When there are suspected cases of an infectious disease, hospital staff have personal protective equipment at their disposal\u2014masks, face shields, gloves\u2014to protect them from virtually any high-consequence pathogen, \u201ceven the new ones that we don\u2019t know about yet,\u201d Leis says. Portable X-rays mean a patient doesn\u2019t need to travel through the hospital for radiology. Even food trays for such patients are disposable, minimizing the need for staff to enter and exit the room.The triage team keeps an active list of dangerous pathogens circulating in different parts of the world, allowing timely investigation based on a patient\u2019s travel history. The list of countries of concern is updated daily.All of this will stand Canada in good stead when patients do start coming to the hospital in greater numbers. The fact that China imposed large-scale quarantines\u2014the \u201clargest restrictions over the greatest number of people in the history of humankind,\u201d says Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto\u2019s University Health Network\u2014may also prove to be a mitigating factor. \u201cThat bought the world several weeks to prepare for widespread global transmission of this infection. Hopefully governments and health ministers used that time wisely.\u201dOn Feb. 19, the daily number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally dropped from thousands to hundreds. Meanwhile, the daily number of newly recovered patients was in the thousands. It might have appeared that the worst of the virus was behind us.But then two people died in Iran that same day, the first fatalities in the Middle East. And then, on Feb. 20, more bad news: In what British Columbia\u2019s provincial health officer called a \u201csentinel event,\u201d a patient was diagnosed as Canada\u2019s ninth person to contract the novel coronavirus. What made this case especially noteworthy is that the patient had never been to China. She had, however, recently returned from a trip to Iran.***On Valentine\u2019s Day, a woman in her 30s boarded an Air Canada flight from Montreal to Vancouver. It was the final leg of her trip home after visiting family north of Tehran.Somewhere on her long journey to Canada, she started to feel sick. A couple days later, her symptoms\u2014fever, cough, headache and general fatigue\u2014were serious enough to bring her to the emergency department. \u201cShe was concerned she might have been in contact with somebody who was sick,\u201d says Bonnie Henry, B.C.\u2019s provincial health officer.The young woman figured it was probably the flu. The doctor who saw her did, too. There was no real reason to suspect COVID-19\u2014the patient hadn\u2019t been anywhere close to anyone who had travelled to China, let alone Wuhan. At least, not that she knew of. Iran didn\u2019t even have a single confirmed case of COVID-19 at the time the patient first presented in emergency.READ: Coronavirus: The worst-case scenarioBut because she had been travelling internationally, the doctor treating her figured it might be worthwhile to test for COVID-19\u2014just in case.When the test came back positive, Henry thought it must be a mistake. \u201cI thought this could be MERS [Middle East Respiratory Syndrome] because it was circulating in that part of the world,\u201d says Henry. But a MERS test came back negative.\u201cThe clinician essentially had a hunch\u2014so it was a bit of a fluke,\u201d Henry says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re thankful, because it allowed us to contain this before it spread to too many people.\u201dThrough the Public Health Agency of Canada, the case was reported to the WHO. Within days, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates confirmed cases of COVID-19 in patients who had recently travelled to Iran. Soon, there were 43 confirmed cases in Iran, with eight deaths.The numbers set off red flags with Ashleigh Tuite, an epidemiologist and adjunct lecturer at the University of Toronto\u2019s Dalla Lana School of Public Health. For starters, China had reported a mortality rate of about two per cent, whereas almost 20 per cent of reported cases had been fatal in Iran. Not to mention, \u201cwith COVID-19, it normally takes a matter of weeks until someone dies,\u201d Tuite says. \u201cSo if you\u2019re seeing deaths reported, those people had been infected for presumably three weeks.\u201dPlus Iran has relatively little outbound air travel to Lebanon or Canada, at least not compared to countries like Iraq, Syria and Azerbaijan\u2014which at the time had zero confirmed cases of COVID-19. The math didn\u2019t add up.Based on the virus\u2019s dispersion from Iran to the U.A.E., Lebanon and Canada, Tuite and a handful of Toronto-based researchers crunched the numbers of Iran\u2019s outgoing international airline travel volume in an effort to figure out the likely scale of the epidemic in Iran.Their findings: Iran likely didn\u2019t have tens of cases of COVID-19, as was officially reported. It probably had somewhere closer to 18,300.Within days, the countries of Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan all had confirmed cases of COVID-19 stemming from people who had recently travelled to Iran.And only a day after the Iranian deputy health minister coughed and sweated his way through a press conference denying claims his government was covering up the scale of the outbreak, he tested positive for COVID-19 and went into self-isolation.A pedestrian in Beijing has his temperature checked (Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)***Around the same time that a patient without any ties to China was diagnosed in Canada, the U.S. had a similar case in its sights\u2014a person in California who hadn\u2019t recently travelled or been exposed to someone with confirmed COVID-19. Although doctors considered the novel coronavirus to be a possible diagnosis for the Californian\u2019s symptoms, they had to wait days for confirmation because of narrow criteria set by the U.S. federal agency responsible for administering tests. How far could COVID-19 have spread in that time? It\u2019s tough to know for sure. The virus is thought to spread from person to person\u2014be it via close contact or what are known as \u201crespiratory droplets,\u201d when someone coughs or sneezes. And its \u201cR naught\u201d rate\u2014which estimates the number of healthy people a single contagious person would infect\u2014is estimated to be between two and three, which is worse than the seasonal flu but not nearly as bad as measles. Meanwhile, symptoms like fever, cough and trouble breathing could take upwards of 14 days to appear.As for how deadly it might become, a Chinese report from mid-February found the case-fatality rate of COVID-19 to be just over two per cent, which if accurate would put COVID-19 on par with the Spanish flu, the 1918 pandemic estimated to have killed at least 50 million people worldwide.RELATED: \u2018It felt like the end of the world\u2019: From Wuhan to Canada in coronavirus quarantineBut experts have been skeptical of the data. To start, Chinese hospitals had been so overwhelmed with sick patients that it\u2019s very plausible that many COVID-19 cases in the region went undetected, because their symptoms were so mild that people didn\u2019t go to hospital. There are also questions about China\u2019s transparency, particularly in light of the fact that Chinese officials initially tried to silence the doctor who had first warned his colleagues about the potential virus. (He died of the coronavirus weeks later.)Without a better sense of the denominator\u2014or the total number of COVID-19 cases, including the most mild\u2014it\u2019s tough to know the fatality rate.What we do know is the daily increase in cases outside mainland China is now outpacing the number of cases within. And the death count is growing. In just over a week in late February, South Korea went from having 30 cases to 2,330, including 13 deaths. Seventeen more were dead in Italy, as of press time. Iran\u2019s death count soon totalled 34. And strings of new cases have emerged in Singapore, Kuwait, Germany, Bahrain and Australia.As soon as the first reports of the novel coronavirus started coming out of China, Isaac Bogoch knew it would only be a matter of time before the virus spread. That\u2019s because, globally speaking, we\u2019re still extremely vulnerable to outbreaks, Bogoch says, and a major reason why is the world\u2019s growing interconnectedness via travel, tourism and trade. \u201cAny person on earth can be at just about any other place on the planet in about 24 hours.\u201dTo get a sense of how international travel could impact the spread of this coronavirus, Bogoch analyzed passenger loads and destinations from 10 major Chinese cities, using data from a three-month period in early 2019. He coupled that data with each country\u2019s corresponding IDVI score.Cambodia\u2014a nation that receives hundreds of thousands of travellers from China, and also has a poor IDVI score\u2014has only one confirmed case of coronavirus as of press time. Similarly, all of Africa, which does $200 billion worth of trade with China annually, has only three confirmed cases.It\u2019s unlikely these regions are simply lucky. \u201cSome of these countries don\u2019t have the capacity for case detection or case management,\u201d Bogoch says. \u201cAnd what happens over there can affect us here [in Canada]. We saw that with Ebola, chikungunya, Zika, SARS, MERS. It\u2019s going to happen again.\u201d***The world is not ready for this pandemic. At least not according to Canadian epidemiologist Bruce Aylward. Upon his return from a two-week mission to China on behalf of the WHO, Aylward commended the Chinese for their aggressive approach to containing and treating COVID-19 patients, while suggesting other countries equally prepare for larger-scale quarantines for people who come in contact with a person testing positive for COVID-19.After the SARS crisis in 2003, the federal government equipped itself with sweeping powers in the event of a disease outbreak. The Quarantine Act, passed in 2005, allows Canada\u2019s health minister to, among other things, divert travelling passengers or cargo, enforce mandatory medical screening and deem any place a \u201cquarantine station\u201d or \u201cfacility\u201d\u2014a private home, a hospital, a hotel, you name it. It allows for strict penalties, including fines up to $1 million and jail time, for people who fail to comply or who endanger others. This was the law that enabled the mandatory quarantine of those the Canadian government flew back from Wuhan.Does the act allow for putting under quarantine places like a school, an apartment building, a city block, a neighbourhood, a town, a suburb or a city? \u201cIf the public health rationale is sufficiently strong, then yes, they could,\u201d explains Steven Hoffman, a global health and law professor at York University and the scientific director of the Institute of Population and Public Health at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. \u201cThe key being that it can\u2019t just be this mass thing that\u2019s limiting a whole lot of Canadians\u2019 rights to liberty merely to contain a few people who are actually posing that risk.\u201dREAD: The science of novel coronavirusBut a city-wide quarantine is inconceivable in the Canadian context, he says. Courts would likely find it unconstitutional. \u201cIt would likely be more in a precision way, focusing on individuals who are at risk of spreading something as opposed to the rather draconian mass quarantines that we would see in China,\u201d Hoffman says.If there is a surge of cases in Canada, public health authorities can be expected to start giving the kind of advice that\u2019s helpful to prevent the flu. Wash your hands. Cough into your elbow. Stay home if you\u2019re sick. \u201cPublic health authorities may encourage people to voluntarily reduce the number of mass gatherings,\u201d says Hoffman, like work conferences.With the number of cases surpassing 200 in Japan, in addition to the more than 700 cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off its coast, that country\u2019s prime minister announced in late February that all schools would be shut for a month to help contain the virus\u2019s spread. \u201cLots of studies show how few people we actually interact with on a daily basis,\u201d says Hoffman. \u201cSchools are where a lot of those different social networks intersect, such that it could be a place where spread could be enabled.\u201dEmergency workers in Japan exit the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship on Feb. 10 (Carl Court/Getty Images)As of late February, Hoffman would put school shutdowns in the category of \u201cgovernment overreaction.\u201d But, he adds, \u201cif a city in Canada faces a huge surge and it\u2019s felt to be uncontrollable, you could imagine schools being temporarily closed,\u201d he says, through government intervention. Still, it\u2019s more likely that schools, workplaces or communities will ask for people to stay home voluntarily as the perceived risk of infection rises. \u201cSome of the research shows that, when people are asked to self-quarantine, there are extremely high rates of compliance.\u201dPublic health agencies have so far been focused on trying to keep people calm. But with stories emerging that suggest a wider spread of the virus is inevitable, public health officials will be at pains to assure people they have plenty of mitigation plans in place. \u201cWe do want the public to know we aren\u2019t just sitting around waiting for new people to test positive,\u201d says Chris Shewchuk, a spokesman for the B.C. health ministry. While trying not to prompt survivalist hauls from grocery stores, public health agencies will want people to consider how they might handle being asked to spend a couple of weeks at home riding out mild symptoms. Whether they can work from home. What it might mean for their loved ones or pets. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to say, \u2018go buy cases of water,\u2019\u2009\u201d Shewchuk says. \u201cIt\u2019s very different from saying we need you to be able to, I don\u2019t know, have enough canned beans.\u201dSo far, patients in Canada with COVID-19 have voluntarily agreed to go into self-isolation at home, where local authorities can check in via phone to monitor them and ask them to check their own temperatures. But if cases become more severe\u2014among elderly people with pre-existing heart or lung conditions who are most at risk, for example\u2014that won\u2019t always be an option.And as the number of infections grow, the health care system needs protocols around how best to manage patients presenting with symptoms, and how best to treat those who test positive.For Gardam, the biggest concern is that Canadian hospitals are routinely running over 100 per cent capacity, especially during flu season. \u201cThere is no room for extra people,\u201d he says\u2014not to mention that a significant portion of hospital beds are currently being used by elderly patients who do not need acute care, but aren\u2019t well enough to go home. \u201cIt\u2019s well-known we need tens of thousands of new nursing-home beds, and we\u2019re not going to build those in three months,\u201d he says.Temporary hospital beds await patients in an exhibition centre in Wuhan, China, on Feb. 4 (AFP/Getty Images)To accommodate the influx, Humber River Hospital officials are already discussing the possibility of having to postpone elective surgeries by months, or even more than a year. Monthly check-ins might be delayed to every two months. Anything to open up another room, or another bed.Then there are potential equipment shortages, where supply could be limited based on other countries facing similar outbreaks. \u201cMost N95 respirators are made in China or the U.S.,\u201d Gardam says. \u201cWe\u2019ve stockpiled more than most countries, but if your stockpile runs out, you could have difficulty getting more equipment.\u201dAnd while plenty of hospitals have the resources to test for influenza, that\u2019s not the case with COVID-19. \u201cIn Ontario, it\u2019s basically all done at the Public Health Lab in downtown Toronto,\u201d Gardam says. \u201cIf we start testing widely, that lab will be overwhelmed.\u201dWith backlogs in testing and overcrowded hospital rooms, many people with mild symptoms might feel less compelled to get themselves checked out. \u201cHow many people in China or Italy have a sore throat and think: \u2018I\u2019m not going to the hospital. I might catch it in the waiting room\u2019?\u201d asks Gardam.And there are still several unknowns, says epidemiologist Timothy Sly, including whether the virus can spread via the asymptomatic\u2014meaning people who present no symptoms at all. \u201cThey could be on the bus, in the cinema or at school,\u201d says the professor at the school of public health at Ryerson University. \u201cAnd they could be spreading it around.\u201dBased on COVID-19\u2019s transmission rates, one WHO adviser estimated two-thirds of the world\u2019s population could get this virus. And even if the transmission rate is cut in half, that\u2019s still roughly one-third of people getting infected.As it stands, Gardam says it\u2019s not overly dramatic to tell anyone they\u2019re likely to get the coronavirus\u2014even in Canada. \u201cThis is a new virus, so presumably none of us have any good immunity to it. With a lack of immunity, why wouldn\u2019t we get it?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe odds are good that I\u2019m going to catch this. The odds are good that you\u2019re going to catch this. And chances are we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d In fact, a huge chunk of the population might not even realize they get it.But then there\u2019s that very small percentage of the population, mostly the elderly, who won\u2019t be fine. If COVID-19 spreads across Canada, infecting half the population, and the virus has a mortality rate of even a fraction of one per cent, tens of thousands of Canadians would die.\u201cIf you think back to what happened during the Spanish flu, every person had a story of a family member who died,\u201d Gardam says. \u201cIt\u2019s possible we could be getting into that scenario.\u201dThis article appears in print in the April 2020 issue of Maclean\u2019s magazine with the headline, \u201cA planet infected.\u201d Subscribe to the monthly print magazine here.\u00a9 Copyright 2019 St. Joseph Communications.",

            "headline": "CERAWeek energy conference in Houston scrapped over coronavirus worries",
            "main_text": "5 Min ReadHOUSTON (Reuters) - Coronavirus concerns prompted organizers on Sunday to cancel one of the world\u2019s most prestigious gatherings of oil ministers and top executives from the energy and financial industries scheduled for this month in Houston.The fast-spreading virus has infected around 85,000 and killed almost 3,000 people around the world. About 70 cases have been diagnosed in the United States, which recorded its first fatality from the virus over the weekend.The CERAWeek energy conference is the latest event to be scrapped due to the disease, which triggered the biggest weekly stock market rout since 2008 last week. Stock markets continue to fall on Monday, but oil prices edged higher in trading in Asia on expectations OPEC will cut output. Oil fell around 15% last week.In its decision to cancel CERAWeek, consultancy IHS Markit noted that border health checks are becoming more restrictive and companies have begun barring non-essential travel to protect workers. In addition, several countries have sidelined events likely to draw large crowds.IHS Markit separately canceled two other international conferences scheduled this month in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Long Beach, California.CERAWeek, first held in 1981, has in the past drawn thousands of attendees to Houston and its energy panels and technology forums. Some 5,500 delegates from 85 countries took part last year at the week-long event, according to the event\u2019s website.The loss of this year\u2019s event will remove one chance for oil and gas executives \u201cto discuss how to deal with declining demand caused by the virus epidemic\u201d as it bears down on the industry, said Francisco Monad, a fellow in Latin American energy policy at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.The oil and gas industry is already battling a sharp slowdown because of the virus. The International Energy Agency last month said in an updated outlook that it was expecting global oil demand growth this year to fall to its lowest level in a decade.Global oil prices have plummeted more than 25% this year as investors fear demand destruction from the virus. Brent oil had traded as high as $68.91 a barrel in January, before the virus outbreak was acknowledged.In previous years, CERAWeek has been a major economic boost to the city of Houston, filling hotels and driving business at restaurants and shops.\u201cIt\u2019s the most important yearly gathering of the industry, in which many significant deals and conversations take place,\u201d Monad said.There were no incidents in Houston that led to the decision to cancel the event, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and IHS Markit Vice Chairman Daniel Yergin said in a joint statement.IHS Markit estimated that the cancellation of the conferences, including CERAWeek, would have a financial impact of about $50 million of non-recurring revenue, its website said.This year\u2019s CERAWeek was expected to draw delegates from more than 80 countries, the company had said, although visitors from some countries were already unable to attend. Coronavirus precautions by the United States include barring visitors to the country who had been China within 14 days of arrival.Among the speakers who were scheduled to attend CERAWeek was Elliott Abrams, the U.S. special envoy for Venezuela, who was expected to address tightening sanctions on the Latin American country\u2019s oil exports. Other speakers on the agenda included the chief executives of Saudi Aramco, BP, ConocoPhillips, Equinor, Occidental Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell and Total SA.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries this week is expected to consider sharp cuts in members\u2019 crude oil output. OPEC and allies are scheduled to meet March 5 and 6 in person in Vienna.Bob Dudley, a former BP chief who is chairman of the industry\u2019s Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, was also due to speak in Houston. The Initiative said in a statement it fully supports \u201cwhat must have been a difficult decision by the organizers.\u201dSaudi Arabia, the biggest OPEC producer, and some other members are considering an output cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) for the second quarter of 2020, more than an initially proposed cut of 600,000 bpd.Reporting by Gary McWilliams in Houston, Marianna Parraga in Mexico City and Stephanie Kelly in New York; Editing by Will Dunham, Lisa Shumaker, Daniel Wallis and Michael PerryAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

At the time, the widow was the only one affiliated with USFK to contract the virus, known as COVID-19.The command said Monday the widow visited Camp Walker\u2019s Post Exchange on Feb. 12 and Feb. 15 and that authorities were conducting contract tracing to see if anyone else had been exposed.There are more than 80,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world, including more than 77,000 within China, the World Health Organization said in an update the morning of Feb. 25.Get the military's most comprehensive news and information every morningFor more newsletters click hereSign up for the Early Bird Brief - a daily roundup of military and defense news stories from around the globe.By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.In South Korea alone, there have been more than 1,000 confirmed cases of the virus, the South China Morning Post reports.

            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.In quickly evolving developments today, Washington state reported the nation's first COVID-19 death and two additional cases in a Seattle area nursing home, prompting the state's governor to declare a state of emergency.At the federal level, officials today announced new travel restrictions involving Iran, parts of Italy, and parts of South Korea.And in international novel coronavirus developments, cases continued to surge in the three main hot spots, two countries reported cases imported from Egypt, and at least three more countries reported their first cases: Ecuador, Monaco, and Qatar.At a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) briefing today, Nancy Messonnier, MD, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the cases lift the number detected by the US public health system to 22. She add that, although the illnesses are still under investigation, they raise the level of concern for certain communities in the United States.Jeffrey Duchin, MD, health officer with Public Health\u2013Seattle & King County, said that, of the three new cases reported by Washington today, none appear to be linked to travel and are considered presumed positives.Two are related to LifeCare Center, a long-term care facility in Kirkland. One involves a female healthcare worker who is hospitalized in satisfactory condition at Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue, and the other patient is a 70-year-old resident who is in serious condition at EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland.Duchin said health officials are evaluating several other people with symptoms at the facility, including 27 of 108 residents and 25 of 180 staff. A CDC team is expected to arrive tonight to assist with the investigation.The fatal case, which he said doesn't appear to be linked to the nursing home outbreak, involves a man in his 50s with underlying medical conditions who was hospitalized at EvergreenHealth Medical Center.Notice of the three new cases in Washington state today follow announcements last night of two other cases of community transmission in the state, involving a high school boy and a woman who had traveled to South Korea. Combined with cases announced yesterday by California and Oregon, the United States now has seven community-transmission cases.At a White House media briefing, President Donald Trump and other federal officials expressed their condolences to the family of the Washington patient.Trump said the country took aggressive early actions, and though more cases are likely, the risk to the nation is still low and infections are mild for most people. He also added that he will meet with pharmaceutical companies at the White House on Monday to discuss issues related to the development of drugs and vaccines.Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the White House's COVID-19 task force, detailed new travel restrictions, similar to the temporary ban announced in late January on people coming from China. The new measures apply to all travelers coming from Iran, including other foreign nationals, and travelers coming from the most affected areas of Italy and South Korea.He also said discussions are under way to step up medical screening in people in other affected countries who will be traveling to the United States. He added that the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response is taking steps to increase the availability of masks\u2014designed to provide 34 million more a month\u2014to protect healthcare workers.Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said community spread now being reported in the United States will require a focus on state and local public health measures to identify and isolate cases and trace contacts. \"The country as a whole is still at low risk, but this is an evolving situation.\"The CDC yesterday boosted travel warnings for Iran and Italy to the highest level, which urges people to avoid nonessential travel due to widespread community transmission and limited access to medical care.In Iran, the health ministry reported 205 more cases and 9 more deaths, raising those respective totals to 595 and 43. Italy today reported 161 more cases and 8 more deaths, lifting its respective totals to 1,049 and 29.The pace of new infections surged even higher in South Korea, with 813 more cases reported today, raising the country's total to 3,150. Four more people died from their infections, putting the fatality count at 17. In one of the daily updates today, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention detailed epidemiologic information on the first 16 deaths, all involving patients who had underlying medical conditions. The deaths occurred mainly in seniors, though 1 involved a patient in his 30s. Six were younger than 60, and 10 were male.In Iran, the health ministry reported 205 more cases and 9 more deaths, raising those respective totals to 595 and 43.Elsewhere in Asia, China reported 427 new cases, raising its overall total to 79,251, according to the National Health Commission daily update. It also reported 47 more deaths and 288 fewer serious cases, putting those respective totals at 2,835 and 7,664.Japan reported 9 more cases, 4 of them from the hot spot in Hokkaido, for a total of 217, and Singapore reported 4 new infections, all linked to the same workplace cluster, raising its total to 102.In other developments, two countries\u2014Canada and France\u2014reported cases imported from Egypt, though only one case has been reported in Egypt. The country's health ministry said it is in contact with Canada and France, following the detection of a case in a Canadian man who been in Egypt and two French travelers who apparently contracted the virus there, according to a media report that cited Egypt's health ministry.At least three countries reported their first cases today: Qatar (Iran travel), Monaco, and Ecuador (Spain travel).Several already affected countries reported new cases, including France, which announced a temporary ban on indoor gatherings of more than 5,000 people.The World Health Organization said today in its latest daily situation report that over the past 24 hours it received 1,318 new reports of illnesses outside China, raising the total to 6,009 from 53 countries.Get CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now\u00bbUnrestricted financial support provided byGrant support for ASP provided byBecome an underwriter\u00bbCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of Minnesota.
