Sometimes people additionally have a low-grade fever, chills,headache,\u00a0muscle\u00a0aches, and a\u00a0general\u00a0sense of tiredness. The illness often begins suddenly, and the\u00a0infected\u00a0person may feel very sick. In most people, the illness is self-limiting with\u00a0symptoms\u00a0lasting for about 1 or 2 days. In\u00a0general,\u00a0children\u00a0experience more vomiting than adults do.Subscribe to Outbreak News TVNorovirus is spread\u00a0person to person\u00a0particularly in\u00a0crowded, closed\u00a0places. Norovirus is typically spread through contaminated food and water,\u00a0touching\u00a0surfaces or\u00a0objects\u00a0contaminated with norovirus and then\u00a0putting\u00a0your hand or\u00a0fingers\u00a0in your mouth and close\u00a0contact\u00a0with\u00a0someone who is vomiting or has diarrhea.The CDC VSP conducts investigations if 3.0% of the ship\u2019s passengers or crew members have GI illness, OR if an unusual GI illness pattern or characteristic is found (even if the illness rate is less than 3%).My cousins are to leave on this ship on March 1st. Is there any chance that it will not be leaving Fort Lauderdale then? Has this ship had to come back into port early this time as it had to the last time? Are the passengers for the March 1st cruise being notified of this problem? Thanks for your help.Ship is coming in one day early.Thanks for this info.My gf is on this ship and they were told today by the CDC  they have to return to port 1 day early.  She was not notified of the last ship coming in early until the day before they boarded.Thanks for the info, Steve.I am scheduled to leave on this ship a March 1 as well.  What is anyone able to tell me?  That is, should I still go?  Just looking for opinions.  Thank you!!Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "Bay Area Lyme Foundation, a leading sponsor of Lyme disease research in the U.S., announces results published in the\u00a0Journal of Clinical Microbiology,\u00a0a journal of the American Society for Microbiology, that point to limitations of currently available diagnostic tests for early-stage Lyme disease, and highlight the need for more research toward improved diagnostics and treatments. Among the findings, the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s standard two-tier testing algorithm (STTTA) for Lyme disease failed to accurately diagnose 71% of blood samples from individuals presenting with a Lyme rash, also known as an\u00a0erythema migrans,\u00a0greater than 5 cm in endemic areas. These samples are part of the\u00a0Lyme Disease Biobank\u00a0(LDB), which was founded to catalyze new research in the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease and other tick-borne infections. Samples are available for research use through an application process to scientists who already work in tick-borne infections as well as those new to the field.\u201cFor an epidemic like Lyme disease that is growing at such an alarming rate, there needs to be more research, greater understanding, better diagnostics, and improved treatments,\u201d said Charles Chiu, MD, PhD, Professor of Laboratory Medicine and Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California, San Francisco, and Bay Area Lyme Foundation scientific advisory board member, who is currently using samples from the Lyme Disease Biobank for his research. \u201cThis study draws attention to the fact that we simply don\u2019t have an accurate test for Lyme disease at present, and this is exactly why clinicians still need to rely on their knowledge of the signs and symptoms of early Lyme disease to diagnose patients and provide prompt treatment.\u201dThese findings also reinforce that Lyme disease does occur in individuals who do not have a\u00a0erythema migrans, and those with rashes smaller than 5 cm. Samples that were laboratory confirmed for Lyme disease (N=82) were more likely to be enrolled with a Lyme rash (83%) and more likely to present with a Lyme rash greater than 5 cm (74%). However, 26% of laboratory confirmed Lyme disease did not present with a Lyme rash greater than 5 cm, including 9% enrolled as having a Lyme rash\u00a0smaller than\u00a05 cm and 17% enrolled without any skin manifestations.\u201cPatients who do not exhibit a rash likely face the greatest challenges in being diagnosed \u2013 not only because many healthcare providers specifically look for this sign to diagnose patients, but because the lack of a rash correlated to less likelihood of an accurate serology test, according to this study,\u201d added Dr. Chiu.Currently comprised of samples from more than 800 participants, the Lyme Disease Biobank utilized 550 patient and control samples (298 cases and 252 controls) collected from 2014 through 2018 for this study. Each sample was tested using both a first tier ELISA and second tier immunoblot (i.e., western blot), and the STTTA was applied. Assays were also performed to detect the presence of tick-borne pathogens (polymerase chain reaction (PCR)), and a subset of samples was evaluated by culture. Of the 298 cases enrolled with signs and symptoms of Lyme disease, only 28% were identified as positive for Lyme disease through these methods, or a modified two-tier testing algorithm, consisting of two positive ELISAs in patients with Lyme rash (erythema migrans) greater than 5 cm. This collection highlights and reinforces the known limitations of STTTA testing in early Lyme disease.\u201cThis study highlights the limitations of available tools for all healthcare providers whose patients may be infected with\u00a0Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. Our hope is that healthcare providers will consider these findings when evaluating patients with signs and symptoms of early Lyme disease,\u201d said Liz Horn, PhD MBI, the study\u2019s lead author and principal investigator for Lyme Disease Biobank. \u201cOur original goal was to characterize the samples we were making available to investigators working on new diagnostics for Lyme disease. We didn\u2019t expect to find such large inaccuracies in current laboratory tests that support clinical decision-making.\u201dAccording to findings, participants presenting with a Lyme rash greater than 5 cm were more likely to be positive by any serologic test. For samples taken while patients were experiencing signs and symptoms of early Lyme disease, a positive ELISA was found in 38-43% of patients with Lyme rashes larger than 5 cm, 17-35% of patients with rashes smaller than 5 cm, and 15-27% of patients without a rash, while 5-11% of controls also received a positive ELISA (ranges represent percent positive using different first-tier tests). For the second tier immunoblots, more cases were positive for IgM than IgG (as would be expected for early Lyme disease).\u201cWe are thrilled to see the Lyme Disease Biobank helping to uncover the critical challenges facing patients and physicians as well as the urgent need for more accurate Lyme disease diagnostics,\u201d said Alex Cohen, President and Co-founder of the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation, whose funding has been instrumental in the rapid expansion of the Lyme Disease Biobank over the past four years.Currently, there are 50 research projects that rely on Lyme Disease Biobank samples.Maine reports more than 2,000 Lyme disease cases in 2019New effective vaccines for Lyme disease are comingLyme disease: The major players, the disagreements and the IDSA draft guidelinesYour email address will not be published.

According to a Reuters report Friday, the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) said only three U.S. states currently have the capacity to run tests for the virus locally\u2013California, Nebraska and Illinois.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"e93f5c907a831a50fb56ab72d394c7a9\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07P15K8Q7,B01CQJHJ2E\";Your email address will not be published.

Student Health Services\u00a0is not currently aware of any students who have the mumps and are contagious.School officials are working closely with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health to monitor this situation.Mumps is a highly infectious viral disease passed through saliva and respiratory secretions. While the incubation period is 12 to 25 days, symptoms often appear 16 to 18 days after exposure.The symptoms of mumps are similar to those of influenza (the flu) and often include tender, swollen glands below the ear and along the jawline on one or both sides of the face and neck; headache; fever and cold-like symptoms. People with mumps are considered infectious from two days before swelling begins through five days after the start of swelling.It is spread through direct contact with saliva or respiratory droplets, and generally, people are most contagious about one to two days before their salivary glands become swollen and painful. It\u2019s most contagious during that flu-like period before the salivary gland swelling.Officials say last year\u2019s experience taught us that the majority of the confirmed mumps cases at Temple involve members of the university community who previously had received the MMR vaccine. Mumps cases among vaccinated people are more common in close-contact settings like university campuses, but vaccination coverage\u2014including booster doses for those who have come into contact with someone sick with mumps\u2014reduces the size and duration of outbreaks.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"963554074e4070d63e73f83011e8e7d7\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B084RRNLPN,B074PB5NJQ,B01KKG9NP6,B081BC7QKK,B0016NRMOM,B07QC4GBCL,B00A9YILC6,048678018X\";Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "Yesterday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration took two significant actions in the agency\u2019s ongoing and aggressive commitment to address the coronavirus outbreak (COVID19).First, the agency issued enforcement discretion and is not objecting to the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) authorizing certain laboratories in New York to begin patient testing after validating their tests and notifying the NYSDOH. Under NYSDOH\u2019s approach, laboratories will provide validation data to NYSDOH within 15 days in lieu of pursuing an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) with FDA.Second, the FDA authorized the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test, the third Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) granted for a diagnostic test during the COVID-19 outbreak.\u201cThese actions today show our commitment to working around the clock to help expedite the availability of tests. This NYSDOH action shows the FDA\u2019s extreme flexibility and adaptability during times of public health emergencies,\u201d said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. \u201cAs a practical matter, what this action means is that labs, authorized by NYSDOH, will not engage with FDA to begin patient testing. Nor will they get an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. These labs will interact solely with NYSDOH, which should expedite the availability of patient testing in New York State. This action demonstrates FDA\u2019s responsiveness to the needs of our country during this time.\u201dThe FDA is granting this flexibility to NYSDOH based on the urgent public health need for additional testing capacity. The FDA weighed several factors in this decision, including that the NYSDOH has a long-established framework in place for oversight of laboratory developed tests in New York State. The FDA had also previously accredited Wadsworth be a third-party reviewer for certain molecular tests.Additionally, the FDA issued an EUA to Roche Molecular Systems for its cobas SARS-CoV-2 test within 24 hours of receiving the application. This is the first commercially distributed diagnostic test to receive an EUA during the COVID-19 outbreak. To expedite access to this test, FDA did not object to Roche pre-positioning its test so that labs could be ready to initiate testing immediately upon authorization of the EUA. Because of that pre-positioning, laboratories can immediately run tests on Roche\u2019s high-volume platform, which will greatly increase national testing capacity.\u201cWe have been encouraging test developers to come to the FDA and work with us,\u201d said Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. \u201cSince the beginning of this outbreak, more than 60 developers have sought our assistance with development and validation of tests they plan to bring through the Emergency Use Authorization process. Additionally, more than 30 laboratories have notified us they are testing or intend to begin testing soon under our new policy for laboratory developed tests for this emergency.\u201dYour email address will not be published.

            "content": "By NewsDesk\u00a0\u00a0@infectiousdiseasenewsNew York state officials announced today 37 additional cases of novel coronavirus since his last update from Sunday, bringing the statewide total to 142 confirmed cases.Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the state will provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer to New Yorkers free of charge. To help combat price-gouging and ensure New Yorkers have access to this vital prevention method, the state will produce up to 100,000 gallons of hand sanitizer each week in 1.7 oz., 7 oz. and gallon bottles.The hand sanitizer will be made available to residents free of charge, and distribution will be prioritized by the most impacted and high risk communities, including the New Rochelle community, and state agencies, including the MTA.\u201cAs the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus continues to rise, unscrupulous retailers are exploiting New Yorkers\u2019 anxieties about the virus and charging exorbitant prices for hand sanitizer and other similar products,\u201d\u00a0Governor Cuomo said.\u00a0\u201cTo solve this problem, the state is producing and deploying hand sanitizer to high impact areas as well as schools, the MTA and other government agencies because you can\u2019t get it on the market and the product that is available is very expensive. The biggest problem we have in this situation is fear, not the virus itself, and I\u2019m once again reminding everyone to focus on the facts because the facts do not warrant the level of anxiety we are seeing.\u201dRobert Koch QuoteThe Governor also announced the New York State Department of Health will work with the New York State Education Department to issue guidance for schools with students, teachers or other staff who test positive for novel coronavirus. Under the policy, schools will close for an initial 24-hour period if a student or a teacher or any other staff at the school test positive for the novel coronavirus. This will allow the school to undergo disinfection, and for the State to perform an assessment of the situation and make a determination going forward in that particular school district.Additionally, the Governor will send a program bill to the legislature today to provide paid sick leave to working New Yorkers and specifically protect those who are required to stay home from work because they are being isolated or quarantined as a result of the novel coronavirus.Your email address will not be published.

We need it not to get to the point that surgeries are having to get canceled. That\u2019s something we absolutely do not want to have happen. To ensure an adequate blood supply we need people to come out and donate blood,\u201d said Dr. Marks.The coronavirus does not pose any known risk to blood donors during the donation process or from attending blood drives.\u201cIt is safe to donate blood,\u201d said Admiral Brett P. Giroir, M.D. Assistant Secretary for Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\u00a0\u201cPart of preparedness includes a robust blood supply. Healthy individuals should schedule an appointment to donate today to ensure that blood is available for those patients who need it,\u201d said Giroir.Blood centers are regulated by the FDA and must follow specific guidelines to ensure safe blood is available for patients at all times.The comments from the federal agencies come as the entire blood banking community is uniting in urging people to donate blood and for organizations to keep hosting blood drives.\u201cBlood donors are needed now more than ever. We cannot wait for the situation to intensify further before taking action. The blood supply cannot be taken for granted and the coronavirus only heightens the need for a ready blood supply,\u201d said Kate Fry, chief executive officer of America\u2019s Blood Centers, the organization that represents close to 50 blood centers throughout the U.S. and Canada who collect close to 60% of the nation\u2019s blood supply.\u201cBlood drives across the country are being canceled. This is going to end up in an unprecedented situation if we\u2019re not careful,\u201d said Chris Hrouda, president of Biomedical Services for the American Red Cross. \u201cWe are doing everything in our power to ensure that we don\u2019t get to a critical level of the blood supply. If we continue to see blood drives cancel, we are going to reach a level of inventory of which we haven\u2019t seen in the past,\u201d said Hrouda.\u201cBlood is an essential part of health care and the need for blood is constant,\u201d said Debra BenAvram, CEO of AABB, the association that accredits the majority of blood banks in the United States. \u201cIn the United States, a patient is treated with a blood transfusion every two seconds. This is only possible through the generosity of our country\u2019s volunteer blood donors. They are the heroes who make lifesaving treatment a reality,\u201d said BenAvram.The Armed Services Blood Program (ASBP), the official blood collector of the U.S. Military, is also echoing the call of its civilian counterparts. \u201cAs the U.S. Military\u2019s official blood program, we always have a mission to stand ready. We are asking if you are able and eligible, consider donating. Take the time to help us stand mission-ready,\u201d said Colonel Audra L. Taylor, ASBP Division Chief, Combat Support, Defense Health Agency.The FDA has\u00a0reiterated\u00a0that there have been no reported or suspected cases of transfusion-transmitted coronavirus and the virus poses no known risk to patients receiving blood transfusions.Your email address will not be published.

In New York City, 95 cases have been confirmed.During a briefing Thursday, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced the state will institute limits on mass gatherings, directing events with 500 or more individuals in attendance to be cancelled or postponed.Public health experts agree mass gatherings with people making sustained close contact are a place where the novel coronavirus can easily infect many people quickly and continue its spread. As such, events, gatherings, or places of business with less than 500 individuals in attendance will be required to cut capacity by 50 percent, with exceptions being made for spaces where individuals do not make sustained close contact, such as schools, hospitals, public buildings, mass transit, grocery stores and retail stores. These new regulations will go into effect Friday, March 13th at 5pm.It has already occurred for Broadway Theaters.Cuomo also announced only medically necessary visits will be allowed at nursing homes in an effort to protect the most vulnerable population.On Friday, the first public drive-through testing facility on the East Coast, located in New Rochelle, will start testing.Testing will be done by appointment only.

Only individuals who are in close contact with a person with COVID-19 would be\u00a0at risk of exposure.The Utah Jazz organization said they are working closely with the CDC, Oklahoma and Utah state officials and the NBA to determine how to best move forward as we gather more information. The individual is currently in the care of health officials in Oklahoma City.This prompted the NBA\u00a0suspend season following Wednesday\u2019s games, saying:The NBA is suspending game play following the conclusion of Wednesday\u2019s schedule of games until further notice. \u00a0The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"fbdb358eda1b22e97286164f0c63954a\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B076LRJRMS,B076LNPT29\";NCAAThe\u00a0NCAA COVID-19 Advisory Panel\u00a0recognizes the fluidity of COVID-19 and its impact on hosting events in a public space. COVID-19 is spreading rapidly in the United States, and behavioral risk mitigation strategies are the best option for slowing the spread of this disease. This is especially important because mildly symptomatic individuals can transmit COVID-19. Given these considerations, coupled with a more unfavorable outcome of COVID-19 in older adults \u2013 especially those with underlying chronic medical conditions \u2013 we recommend against sporting events open to the public. We do believe sport events can take place with only essential personnel and limited family attendance, and this protects the players, employees, and fans.Universities going onlineIn-person classes were\u00a0canceled or postponed at\u00a0more than 100 universities by late afternoon Wednesday, according to a list maintained by Georgetown scholar Bryan Alexander.Among them is Columbia University in New York.

The warning letters are the first to be issued by the FDA for unapproved products intended to prevent or treat \u201cNovel Coronavirus Disease 2019\u201d (COVID-19).\u201cThe FDA considers the sale and promotion of fraudulent COVID-19 products to be a threat to the public health. We have an aggressive surveillance program that routinely monitors online sources for health fraud products, especially during a significant public health issue such as this one,\u201d said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. \u201cWe understand consumers are concerned about the spread of COVID-19 and urge them to talk to their health care providers, as well as follow advice from other federal agencies about how to prevent the spread of this illness. We will continue to aggressively pursue those that place the public health at risk and\u00a0hold bad actors accountable.\u201d\u201cThere already is a high level of anxiety over the potential spread of coronavirus,\u201d said FTC Chairman Joe Simons. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t need in this situation are companies preying on consumers by promoting products with fraudulent prevention and treatment claims. These warning letters are just the first step. We\u2019re prepared to take enforcement actions against companies that continue to market this type of scam.\u201dThe FDA is particularly concerned that products that claim to cure, treat or prevent serious diseases like COVID-19 may cause consumers to delay or stop appropriate medical treatment, leading to serious and life-threatening harm.The FDA and FTC jointly issued warning letters to\u00a0Vital Silver,\u00a0Quinessence Aromatherapy Ltd.,\u00a0Xephyr, LLC doing business as N-Ergetics,\u00a0GuruNanda, LLC,\u00a0Vivify Holistic Clinic,\u00a0Herbal Amy LLC, and\u00a0The Jim Bakker Show. \u00a0The products cited in these warning letters are teas, essential oils, tinctures and colloidal silver. The FDA has\u00a0previously warned\u00a0that colloidal silver is not safe or effective for treating any disease or condition. The FDA and FTC requested companies respond in 48 hours describing the specific steps they have taken to correct the violations. Companies that sell products that fraudulently claim to prevent, treat or cure COVID-19 may be subject to legal action, including but not limited to seizure or injunction.There are currently no vaccines or drugs approved to treat or prevent COVID-19. Although there are investigational COVID-19 vaccines and treatments under development, these investigational products are in the early stages of product development and have not yet been fully tested for safety or effectiveness.Outbreak News Interviews PodcastIn addition to following up with companies that fail to make adequate corrections, the FDA and FTC will continue to monitor social media, online marketplaces and incoming complaints to help ensure that the companies do not continue to sell fraudulent products under a different company name or on another website. An FDA cross-agency task force has been established and dedicated to closely monitor for fraudulent products related to COVID-19. The task force has already reached out to major retailers to ask for their help in monitoring their online marketplaces for fraudulent products claiming to combat coronavirus and other pathogens. The task force has already worked with major retailers and online marketplaces to remove more than three dozen listings of fraudulent COVID-19 products. Several have already agreed to monitor their marketplaces for COVID-19 claims.The FDA reminds consumers to be cautious of websites and stores selling products that claim to prevent, mitigate, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19. Fraudulent COVID-19 products may come in many varieties, including dietary supplements and other foods, as well as products purporting to be drugs, medical devices or vaccines.

The child was adopted from another country.This is the first case of measles in the county since 2008.Health officials are careful to not to say that there will be more cases of measles, but if your vaccination is not up to date\u2014get vaccinated.Measles or rubeola, is an acute highly communicable viral disease that is characterized by Koplik spots in the cheek or tongue very early in the disease. A couple of days later a red blotchy rash appears first on the face, and then spreads, lasting 4-7 days. Other symptoms include fever, cough and red watery eyes. The patient may be contagious from four days prior to the rash appearance to four days after rash appearance.The disease is more severe in infants and adults. Complications from measles which is reported in up to 20% of people infected include; seizures, pneumonia, deafness and encephalitis.Prevention is through vaccination. The MMR vaccine was first licensed for use in 1971. This vaccine should be given in two doses at 12-15 months and the second at 4-6 years. Some adults should get one dose of the vaccine if they were born after 1956 and have no record of having the diseases or vaccinations. As an adult you don\u2019t need the vaccine if you meet certain criteria such as age or negative blood tests.A few years ago, a MMRV vaccine was developed which includes protection against varicella or chickenpox.Your email address will not be published.

Currently there are no federal standards for indicators organisms in salad greens like there are for other foods like milk, beef and drinking water. The indicator organisms themselves generally do not cause illness in healthy people.Pathogens like E.coli O157:H7 and Salmonella were not found in this lab analysis.According to the release, Consumer Reports had an outside lab test 208 containers (plastic clamshell or bags) of 16 brands of salad greens bought in stores in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York and found out the following:\u2022 39 percent of samples exceeded 10,000 CFUs (or another similar measure) per gram for total coliforms and 23 percent for enterococcus, the levels industry consultants deemed unacceptable.\u2022 Many packages containing spinach, and packages which were one to five days from their use-by date, had higher bacterial levels. Packages six to eight days from their use-by date generally fared better.\u2022 Whether the greens came in a clamshell or bag, included \u201cbaby\u201d greens, or were organic made no difference in bacteria levels.As a result of this study, Consumers Union had issued a report urging the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to set safety standards for greens.Consumer Reports recommends the following actions to avoid getting sick from packaged leafy greens:\u2022 Buy packages far from their use-by date.\u2022 Wash the greens even if the packages say \u201cprewashed\u201d or \u201ctriplewashed.\u201d Rinsing won\u2019t remove all bacteria but may remove residual soil.\u2022 Prevent cross contamination of greens by keeping them away from raw meat and poultry.Consumer ReportsYour email address will not be published.

            "content": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) along with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Rhode Island Department of Health and several other agencies have been investigating an outbreak of Salmonella serotype Montevideo which began last July.The outbreak which as of Thursday totaled 202 individuals in 42 states having matching strains based on DNA analysis.Thirty-eight patients infected with the salmonella had to be hospitalized and fortunately there were no deaths.Daniele International Inc. of Rhode Island is the producer of the ready to eat salami products suspected of causing the nationwide outbreak. Just last week, Daniele International recalled 1,240,000 pounds of ready-to-eat (RTE) varieties of Italian sausage products, including salami due to being suspected in the outbreak. It is important to note that the investigation is ongoing and the salami has yet to be definitively identified as the cause.In addition, the Rhode Island Department of Health reported in a press release Thursday that ground black pepper samples from an open container at Daniele Inc. has tested positive for salmonella. It has also been confirmed that the pepper contained the same strain of salmonella associated with the national outbreak.Because of the black pepper discovery, the US Food and Drug Administration, which regulates pepper, is now involved in the investigation.Of the over 2000 strains of salmonella, Salmonella serotype Montevideo is one of the most common strains.Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.In rare circumstances, infection with salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.Your email address will not be published.

It was established to highlight the importance of continuing influenza vaccination, as well as fostering greater use of flu vaccine after the holiday season into January and beyond.What if someone in your family does get the flu? The CDC recommends if it\u2019s possible for you to create a \u201csick room\u201d to isolate your sick family member and protect the rest of the family.Here are the steps and supplies needed for creating your \u201csick room\u201d (adapted from the CDC web site):\u2022 Try to give the sick person their own room. If there is more than one sick person, they can share the sick room if needed\n\u2022 If you have more than one bathroom, have sick people use one bathroom and well people use the other one\n\u2022 Give each sick person their own drinking glass, washcloth and towelHave these items in the sick room\u2022 Tissues\n\u2022 Trash can with lid and lined with a plastic trash bag\n\u2022 Alcohol-based hand rub\n\u2022 Cooler or pitcher with ice and drinks\n\u2022 Cup with straw or squeeze bottle to help with drinking\n\u2022 Thermometer (with covers if used for more than one person)\n\u2022 Humidifier\n\u2022 Facemasks (Sick people should wear a facemask if available when they leave the sick room or are around other people.)Follow the Sick Room RulesProtect well family members from getting the flu. If the sick person must leave the room to go to the bathroom or to the doctor, ask them to wear a facemask. No facemask at home? Ask the sick person to use a tissue to cover their coughs and sneezes.Follow these four sick room rules:1. Avoid having other people enter the sick room. The sick person should not have visitors other than the caregiver. If visitors must enter, they should stay at least 6 feet away from the sick person.\n2. Cover coughs and sneezes. Ask the sick person to cover their nose and mouth with a tissue when they cough and sneeze. Ask them to throw used tissues in the trash.\n3. Choose one caregiver. If you can, choose only one caregiver to take care of sick family members. If possible, ask someone else to be the caregiver if you are pregnant or have certain chronic health problems. If you get the flu, it could be much more serious for you.\n4. Keep the air clean. Open a window in the sick room, if possible.How to Clean the Sick RoomYou\u2019ll want to clean the sick room each day. Follow these tips:Cleaning hard surfaces\u2022 Clean surfaces that may have flu germs on them. These may include doorknobs, bedside tables, bathroom sinks, toilets, counters, phones, and toys\n\u2022 Clean these hard surfaces by using water and dish soap. Or use common household cleaners that kill germs\nCleaning bed linens and laundry\n\u2022 Wash bed sheets and towels with normal laundry soap and tumble dry on a hot dryer setting. Hold all dirty laundry away from your face and body. Wash your hands right after touching dirty laundry\n\u2022 It\u2019s OK to wash the sick person\u2019s bedding or clothes with other people\u2019s laundry\nCleaning dishes \u2014 wash the sick person\u2019s dishes with normal dish soap or place in the dishwasherTips for Caregivers \u2013 It\u2019s Important for YOU to Stay HealthyWhen caring for people who have the flu:\u2022 Avoid being face-to-face with the sick person, and limit time with them if possible.\n\u2022 When holding sick children, place their chin on your shoulder so they will not cough in your face\n\u2022 Wash your hands often and the right way. Sing the \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d song two times or count slowly to 20 as you wash\n\u2022 Use soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub\n\u2022 Clean your hands after touching the sick person, their tissues or laundryYour email address will not be published.

It may not be the tastiest meals we ever had but most people are not concerned with the safety.Well until now.After an inspection late last year of LSG SkyChefs facility in Denver, Colorado you make think twice about the quality of the airline food.The US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) inspection team found some of the worst, most disgusting sanitary conditions that it\u2019s hard to imagine eating airline food again.In a Warning Letter and Notice of Provisional Status letter issued by the FDA in December sent to LSG Skychefs, an example of some of the violations is:A. Insects and vermin found in food preparation areas1. In the cart wash area: TNTC (too numerous to count) live and dead roaches\n2. Silverware station: 40 live roaches\n3. In addition, roaches and ants are found throughout the hot kitchen, the pots and pans room and the dishwasher.B. In food handling areas1. Employees handling food with bare hands\n2. Water leaks\n3. Holes in the wall which were an entrance for insects and verminC. And finally, in environmental monitoring samples collected from various areas of the food processing facility, several sites grew the bacterium, Listeria monocytogenes, including areas in the hot kitchen area.LSG Skychefs, Denver will need to get their act together before re-inspection. If they fail again they could be shut down.There are no known or reported cases of disease transmission as a result of the above violations.Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "You know the signs of getting a cold; sneezing, runny nose and scratchy throat. The cold is the most common illness known: it\u2019s the leading cause of doctor\u2019s visits and the number one reason for missing school or work.As a matter of fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), well over 20 million school days are missed each year in the US due to the cold.Here are some numbers:\n\u2022 Children average more than 6-12 colds annually.\n\u2022 Adults average 2 -4 cold a year, though it can vary\n\u2022 Women ages 20-30 have more colds than men\n\u2022 People older than 60 have about one cold a year\n\u2022 Some estimates say that in a one year time frame, people in the US suffer 1 billion coldsWhat are the causes of the common cold?There are more than 200 different viruses that are known to causes the symptoms of the common cold. The Rhinoviruses, of which there are more than 100 types, are the major known cause of the common cold in adults which account for up to 40% of infections.They are most common in the fall, spring and summer. They grow best at the same temperature as the temperature inside the nose.Coronaviruses are responsible for approximately 10-15% of common colds in adults and are most common in winter and early spring when the prevalence of rhinoviruses is low.Some other viruses implicated are adenoviruses, parainfluenza viruses and influenza viruses.The cause of about half of the common colds are unknown.How do you get infected by cold viruses?Mostly from touching contaminated surfaces, such as telephones, door knobs, etc., and then touching nose or eyes. Also transmission is possible through inhaling airborne droplets of mucus in the air.Is it common to get a fever when you have a cold?Fever is uncommon in children over three and rare in adults. In infants and young children a fever if present is slight but can climb to 102F.How long does a cold last?Symptoms can last from 2 to 14 days, with most people recovering after a week. If symptoms last much longer than 2 weeks it may be an allergy and not a cold.Are there any complications to the common cold?Colds do occasionally lead to bacterial infection of the sinuses or middle ear which would require the use of antibiotics.Is there a cure for the cold?No. And there is not a preventive measure like a vaccine for the cold either. Due to the incredible amount of different viruses that cause the cold, making a vaccine is going to be extremely difficult.You can however do the following to relieve the symptoms of the cold:\u2022 Bed rest\n\u2022 Drink plenty of fluids\n\u2022 Gargling or using throat sprays/lozenges\n\u2022 Taking Tylenol for headache or feverWhat are some of the myths about the common cold?Three of the most common misconceptions about colds are:\u2022 You get a cold from exposure to cold weather or from getting chilled or overheated.\n\u2022 You get it from factors like exercise, diet or enlarger tonsils.\n\u2022 The use of large quantities of vitamin C will prevent colds.What about the use of over the counter medications and antibiotics?Nonprescription cold medicines and antihistamines may relieve the symptoms related to a cold, but they will not prevent or shorten the length of your cold. The same goes for the use of steam, it may relieve the symptoms of congestion, but it is not an effective treatment.NEVER take antibiotics to treat a cold, they do NOT kill viruses.What about prevention?Wash your hands frequently and teach your children to do the same. Keep your hands away from your eyes and nose since that\u2019s where the virus enters. Avoid being close to people with colds and avoid people when you have one. Cover your nose or mouth when you cough or sneeze. Everything your mother harped on since you were young.Your email address will not be published.

It does have a sub tropical humid climate which is conducive to many emerging diseases found in the tropics. But according to experts, the weather in December is too cold for local transmission.Malaria is endemic in Equatorial Guinea where the workers were located and transmission is very possible for visitors to the country without appropriate prophylaxis.Portugal had 41 cases of imported malaria in 2008.It is estimated to be up to a half a billion cases of malaria annually with about 1 million deaths, particularly among young children.The disease may manifest itself after an incubation of days to months. Once the parasites build up in the blood, symptoms are non-specific; fever, chills, body aches, diarrhea and vomiting. At this point the only way to confirm is finding the parasites in blood. These early stages resemble many other febrile diseases.Paroxysms (due to rupture and release of the parasite and metabolic products into the system), happen every 48-72 hours depending on the species.There is a cold stage which leads to teeth chattering, shaking chills followed by a hot stage (fever) where temperatures may reach 106\u00b0F. Convulsions may develop particularly in children.Untreated P. falciparum (the life-threatening species) can lead to severe malaria. Severe malaria is characterized by cerebral malaria, severe anemia, renal failure (black water fever), respiratory distress and bleeding disorders and shock.Prompt treatment for falciparum malaria is essential because death from cerebral complications may occur.Your email address will not be published.

DOH also reported that the patient\u2019s wife tested positive for COVID-19 after contact tracing activities were prompted. This brings the total number of COVID-19 cases in the country to six (6).The 6th confirmed case is a 59-year-old female who presented with cough and was admitted at the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM) on March 5. The patient is currently in stable condition.\u201cThe DOH is currently exhausting all its efforts to identify others who may have come in contact with the confirmed cases to ensure that this localized transmission does not progress to community spread,\u201d Health Secretary Francisco T. Duque III said.In light of the confirmation of localized transmission in the country and in anticipation of possible sustained community transmission, DOH has raised the COVID-19 Alert System to\u00a0Code Red sublevel 1.\u00a0DOH is quick to clarify that this is a preemptive call to ensure that national and local governments and public and private health care providers can prepare for possible increase in suspected and confirmed cases.With Code Red, the DOH has recommended to the Office of the President for the declaration of a State of Public Health Emergency which will facilitate mobilization of resources, ease processes, including procurement of critical logistics and supplies, and intensifying reporting.At this stage of\u00a0localized transmission, intensified contact tracing and home quarantine of close contacts of confirmed cases, improved hospital preparedness, enhanced Severe Acute Respiratory Illness surveillance, and activation of other laboratories outside of RITM to increase capacity to diagnose are now being implemented.Philippines report 25,000 dengue cases in first 6 weeks of 2020, Alarm expressed in Cebu area\u201cThis declaration is a signal to all concerned agencies, Local Government Units and health care providers to be ready to implement planned response measures. We are continuously reminding everyone to practice personal protective measures such as hand hygiene, social distancing, and proper cough etiquette. Avoid unnecessary travel and postpone mass gatherings, as well. It is our individual responsibility to protect ourselves and the people around us. Only through collective action in our communities will we be able to limit the spread of the virus,\u201d the Health Chief reminded.However, once there is\u00a0sustained community transmission\u00a0\u2013 or an increasing number of local cases whose links cannot be established \u2013 the strategy will be shifted from an intensive contact tracing to the implementation of community-level quarantine (or lockdown), and/or possibly, suspension of work or school.

Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus\u00a0Hyalomma\u00a0are the principal vector.The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.\u00a0Human-to-human transmission is possible.Your email address will not be published.

In the new work, Moses Katabarwa of the Carter Center, USA, and colleagues report in\u00a0PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases\u00a0the first known and successful coordinated cross-border mass drug administration (MDA) effort with ivermectin to stop onchocerciasis.Onchocerciasis is a tropical disease caused by the parasitic worm\u00a0Onchocerca volvulus, spread through\u00a0Simulium\u00a0flies that breed in fast flowing rivers and streams in Africa. The disease, also called \u201criver blindness,\u201d can cause skin and eye symptoms. An onchocerciasis transmission zone known as Galabat-Metema is shared between Sudan and Ethiopia respectively, both countries having established a nationwide policy for elimination of the disease. Baseline disease mapping of 0-18% among 14 villages in Galabat, Sudan and 14-44% in 17 villages in the Metema district of Ethiopia.Mass drug administration was provided once and subsequently twice per year in the area, with two doses per eligible person-per-year beginning in 2016 in Ethiopia and 2008 in Sudan. To determine if transmission had been interrupted on both side of the border, blood tests for onchocerciasis antibody were carried out in children and vector Simullium black flies were tested in \u2018pools\u2019 of 100 flies/pool for\u00a0O. volvulus\u00a0DNA in both countries.Blood tests on 10,003 children were all negative and only one vector positive pool among 36,731 flies was positive. The WHO criteria for stopping MDA were met, and MDA was halted at the end of 2017 in a coordinated binational manner through a process of close collaboration and communication between the governments of Sudan and Ethiopia. This is the first repot of such a cross border stop MDA decision.\u201cOnchocerciasis transmission zones may cross international borders and so present a unique challenge of coordination between the different national program activities on each side of the border,\u201d the researchers say. \u201cSeveral lessons were learned from this experience.\u201damzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"3798d64c323a727e5156f12d33851a2e\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"0815344732,0803675798\";Polio: Pakistan reports 8 additional WPV1 cases, cVDPV case reported in KinshasaLassa fever: Nigeria reports another 104 confirmed casesGuinea worm disease: 53 cases reported in 2019, Vast majority in ChadYour email address will not be published.

            "content": "As reported in a Letter to the Editor in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, a veterinary student in South Africa got sickened with West Nile Virus (WNV) last year after doing an autopsy on a 4 month old Welsh pony.According to the report, the vet student who removed the brain of the pony was sickened with fever, malaise, body aches, stiff neck and a severe headache 6 days after handling the horse brain at autopsy. A rash later appeared and the symptoms lasted for 10 days.The genetic material from the student and the horse revealed a fatal form of WNV known as lineage 2.According to the report, the only personal protective equipment the vet student used during the autopsy was latex gloves. However when using bone saws such as the type required to cut open the skull, both tissue particles and potential pathogenic organisms can be aerosolized.Exposure through the mucous membranes such as the eyes or through inhalation was the likely route of transmission since neither eye protection nor masks were used.Since no one else involved in the autopsy was sickened or developed antibodies to WNV, it is suspected that the concentration of WNV is higher in nerve tissue.It has been reported that the vet student had fully recovered and is now a practicing veterinarian.West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne disease that can cause encephalitis, a brain inflammation. WNV is closely related to St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) which is found in the United States and to Kunjin virus (KV) which is found in Australia, some Western Pacific islands and parts of South East Asia. West Nile virus was first detected in North America in 1999 in New York. Prior to that it had only been found in Africa, Eastern Europe, and West Asia.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 80 percent of people (about 4 out of 5) who are infected with WNV will not show any symptoms at all.Up to 20 percent of the people who become infected have symptoms such as fever, headache, and body aches, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes swollen lymph glands or a skin rash on the chest, stomach and back. Symptoms can last for as short as a few days, though even healthy people have become sick for several weeks.About one in 150 people infected with WNV will develop severe illness. The severe symptoms can include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, vision loss, numbness and paralysis. These symptoms may last several weeks, and neurological effects may be permanent.There is no specific treatment for WNV infection.Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "The nation of Zimbabwe which had experienced a massive cholera outbreak that started in August 2008 is going through two additional infectious disease outbreaks in 2010.Though the cholera epidemic has tapered down, there have still been nearly 150 cases with five deaths since late 2009. This is however a dramatic decrease from the 37,000 cases and nearly 2,000 deaths from the same time frame a year earlier.The dilapidated and broken sanitation system and water infrastructure that caused the last outbreak is still in the same state of disrepair and health officials fear another possible large outbreak during the rainy season.Cholera is an acute bacterial intestinal disease characterized by sudden onset, profuse watery stools (given the appearance as rice water stools because of flecks of mucus in water) due to a very potent enterotoxin. The enterotoxin leads to an extreme loss of fluid and electrolytes in the production of diarrhea. It has been noted that an untreated patient can lose his bodyweight in fluids in hours resulting in shock and death.It is caused by the bacterium, Vibrio cholerae. Serogroups O1 and O139 are the types associated with the epidemiological characteristics of cholera (outbreaks).The bacteria are acquired through ingestion of contaminated water or food through a number of mechanisms. Water is usually contaminated by the feces of infected individuals. Drinking water can be contaminated at the source, during transport or during storage at home. Food can get contaminated by soiled hands, during preparation or while eating.In addition to the cholera situation, the country is also facing a measles outbreak which began in September 2009. Since that time there have been over 1800 cases and 75 deaths.There is a Measles Task Force headed from the Zimbabwe health ministry and the World Health Organization (WHO) there to determine risk and determine vaccination needs.Measles or rubeola, is an acute highly communicable viral disease that is characterized by Koplik spots in the cheek or tongue very early in the disease. A couple of days later a red blotchy rash appears first on the face, and then spreads, lasting 4-7 days. Other symptoms include fever, cough and red watery eyes. The patient may be contagious from four days prior to the rash appearance to four days after rash appearance.The disease is more severe in infants and adults. Complications from measles which is reported in up to 20% of people infected include; seizures, pneumonia, deafness and encephalitis.And to make a bad situation worse, it has been reported that 24 children have contracted schistosomiasis from after playing in contaminated water at a nearby reservoir.Schistosomiasis is an acute or chronic disease, produced by parasites called Schistosoma. It is not a single disease, but a disease complex initiated by several different species of schistosomes. The three most important human species are Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium and S. japonicum.The schistosomes are found in fresh water. This water gets contaminated by infected people working in the rice field, fisherman in the lake or children playing who indiscriminately defecate or urinate in the water.The free-swimming stage (cercariae)\u00a0of the parasite is capable of penetrating the unbroken skin of the human host.This shows what a combination of poverty, poor sanitation, poor health care, and bad infrastructure does to the public health of a nation\u2026infectious diseases can really take hold under such conditions.Your email address will not be published.

Testing confirmed that the offending virus was Rift Valley Fever a week ago.The other six people infected have mild disease and are under observation and treatment.The deputy minister of health says the disease poses no threat to the soccer event and is not considered a crisis.Rift Valley Fever is mosquito-borne virus that is endemic in parts of Africa including South Africa. It primarily infects animals like sheep, cattle and goats and it can have an economic impact on a community due to the loss of livestock.Humans get infected through contact with infected animal blood or organs. Butchering and slaughtering of animals is a primary cause of transmission to humans. Certain occupations are at a higher risk of getting Rift Valley Fever like farmers, herders and veterinarians.It can also be transmitted to humans through mosquito bites and the bites of blood-sucking flies.Most cases of Rift Valley Fever are mild and symptoms include fever, headaches and muscle pain. However, a small percentage of people can get serious disease which includes retinitis, encephalitis and a hemorrhagic fever. Fatalities happen in less than 1 percent of those infected.The health department is recommending those farmers in Free State and Northern Cape use gloves and other protective gear when doing high risk activities like slaughtering.I\u2019d like to thank and acknowledge Fransa Burger for giving me a heads up on this outbreak.Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "According to a March 4th Senegalese Ministry of Health announcement, there are two confirmed of polio in the country. These are the first polio cases reported in the country since 1998.This is the most recent announcement coming this part of Africa. These are likely associated with the spread of polio from endemic Nigeria to its neighboring countries. According to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, the epidemic first spread from polio-endemic Nigeria to its polio-free neighbors in 2008 and is still paralyzing children in West and Central Africa.Nine countries \u2013 Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Senegal and Sierra Leone \u2013 are considered to have active outbreaks of polio (i.e. cases within the last six months).Polio is caused by the poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3. All three types cause paralysis, with wild poliovirus type 1 being isolated from paralysis cases most often.This viral infection is primarily spread from person to person through the fecal-oral route. However, in places where sanitation is very good, transmission though throat secretions may be considered more important.Polio is recognized in about 1 percent of infections by flaccid paralysis, while over 90 percent of infections are unapparent.Paralysis of poliomyelitis is usually asymmetric and the site of paralysis depends on the location of nerve cell destruction on the spinal cord or brain stem. Legs are affected more often than the arms.Paralysis of the respiration can be life threatening.Polio must be differentiated from other paralytic diseases like botulism and Guillain-Barre Syndrome.With immunization, by the end of 2007, polioviruses were limited to only four countries who had not succeeded in interrupting transmission; Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan. But as mentioned above, the risk of importation of polio remains a problem.Most cases of polio are in children under the age of three.Prevention of polio is through immunization, either through the live oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) or the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV).Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "The continent of Africa has a large portion of the world\u2019s HIV positive people with some estimates in the 60% range.Because of the high incidence of HIV in the general and blood donor population and inadequate or no donor testing, transfusion associated HIV continues to be a major problem on the continent.According to the World Health Organization (WHO) web site, five to ten per cent of all new HIV cases in Africa are due to contaminated blood and blood products used for transfusion.Blood transfusions are a necessary part of treatment for some of the health issues Africans face every day; anemia due to malaria infections and malnutrition, both of which plagues the continent.Disease tainted blood (not only HIV, but hepatitis and syphilis for example) is frequently the only option for a dying patient on a continent which also falls way short of their blood needs. According to a piece in MediaGlobal, there are 3 million units collected with at least 8 million required annually.Contracting HIV through a blood transfusion is practically guaranteed according to coordinator of WHO Blood Transfusion Safety, Dr. Neelam Dhingra. Dhingra notes that the risk of transmission of HIV through blood transfusion is extremely high (95-100 per cent) as compared to other routes of transmission, perinatal (11-32 per cent) and sexual contact (0.1-10 per cent).In an attempt to curb this problem, Dhinga says more nations are putting in policies for mandatory blood screening of all units collected. However factors like lack of infrastructure, supplies and quality systems tend to make this policy difficult to adhere to.Sites of Interest:safebloodforafrica.org\nmakingsafebloodavailableinafricastatement.pdf\nWHO Blood Transfusion SafetyYour email address will not be published.

            "content": "Although only a couple of cases of US travelers get this disease annually, many tourists choose the adventure of game parks in Africa to spend their vacation.Often a fatal disease with 15,000-20,000 cases reported annually, more than 60 million people are at risk in more than 30 African countries.One of the true tropical diseases, African sleeping sickness is endemic only in sub-Sahara Africa bounded by 15\u00b0 North and South latitudes.Two varieties of African sleeping sickness exist: one primarily in East Africa caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. T.B. rhodesiense produces an acute infection that will usually cause severe illness and death in weeks to months.The other species is Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. This parasite is found in West and Central Africa. However, the 2 species are showing some geographic overlap.This infection progresses more slowly and may require months to years for disease to occur.Both types of sleeping sickness are caused by the bite of a tse tse fly. These vicious little bugs depend on blood meals for its nutrients. It gets the blood from mammals including humans. The tse tse fly (below) has a very painful bite and a traveler will certainly remember getting bit.When taking a blood meal, the fly injects the parasite into the skin. From here the parasite is carried to the lymphatic system and eventually the bloodstream.They go through stages in the body and eventually end up in the spinal fluid.Symptoms are as follows:\u2022 East African sleeping sickness: the development of a chancre at the bite site followed by fever, fatigue, aching muscles and joints and swollen lymph nodes are characteristic. After central nervous system (CNS) invasion neurological manifestations may occur followed by death if untreated.\u2022 West African sleeping sickness: symptoms are similar to the above however taking longer to appear. Progressive confusion, personality changes, daytime sleepiness with nighttime sleep disturbances are late stage symptoms. Death will happen after several years if left untreated.There is no immunity produced so reinfection is possible.Diagnosis of African sleeping sickness is based on finding the parasite in blood (below), spinal fluid or lymph node aspirates.There are treatment options for sleeping sickness depending on blood stage or CNS stage. Treatment should begin as soon as possible.There is no vaccine for African trypanosomes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the following preventive measures:1. Wear protective clothing, including long-sleeved shirts and pants. The tsetse fly can bite through thin fabrics, so clothing should be made of medium-weight material.\n2. Wear neutral-colored clothing. The tsetse fly is attracted to bright colors and very dark colors.\n3. Inspect vehicles for tsetse flies before entering. The tsetse fly is attracted to moving vehicles.\n4. Avoid bushes. The tsetse fly is less active during the hottest period of the day. It rests in bushes but will bite if disturbed.\n5. Use insect repellant. Though insect repellants have not proven effective in preventing tsetse fly bites, they are effective in preventing other insects from biting and causing illness.Areas of heavy infestation tend to be sporadically distributed and are usually well known to local residents. Avoidance of such areas is the best means of protection.Your email address will not be published.

The disease though somewhat rare has been seen in areas of Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, particularly after heavy rains. In Thailand it is considered\u00a0a disease\u00a0of rice farmers.Check out the podcast\u2013Outbreak News InterviewsThe organism is saprophytically found in soil and water. People usually get infected by contact with contaminated soil or water through skin wounds, inhalation or rarely through ingestion of contaminated water.Person to person transmission can occur through contact with blood and body fluids of an infected person.NECTAR Sleep: The Most Comfortable MattressDepending on how heavy the infection\u00a0incubation can range from hours to weeks. Infection may show no symptoms\u00a0but it can quickly progress to disseminated disease involving skin and a variety of organs.Pneumonia from B. pseudomallei can be seen either in acute or chronic disease. Chronic pulmonary meloidosis may present itself years after exposure and can mimic tuberculosis.Fatality rates of melioidosis can reach up to 75 percent even with appropriate antibiotic\u00a0treatment. Fatalities are particularly greater in those with underlying conditions like\u00a0diabetes mellitus\u00a0or renal disease.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Good reads\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"7debe0e967a3306509e7d971aa5ab281\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"0316343692,1421426609,1421420465,1640121420,0316418080,B07CP6LRVX,B000SN9WN0,1426217668\";Your email address will not be published.

Vaccination is also recommended for travelers visiting Iguassu Falls.Vaccination is NOT recommended for travel to the following coastal cities: Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Salvador, Recife, and Fortaleza.In the United States, the vaccine is given only at designated yellow fever vaccination centers.In addition to vaccination, other prevention measures include avoiding mosquito bites when traveling in tropical areas. Mosquitoes that spread yellow fever usually bite during the day, especially at dusk and dawn.When outside:\n\u2022 Wear long-sleeved clothing and long pants. For extra protection, treat clothing with the insecticide permethrin.\n\u2022 Use insect repellent on exposed skin. Repellents containing DEET (N,N-diethylmetatoluamide), Picaridin (KBR 3023), IR 3535, p-Menthane 3,8-diole (PMD or oil of lemon eucalyptus) are effective. Follow application instructions carefully.When inside:\n\u2022 Stay in well-screened areas as much as possible.\n\u2022 Spray living and sleeping areas with insecticide.Your email address will not be published.

One of the soldiers was so severely ill that he was taken to the Army hospital at Fort Bragg, NC.The soldier, who was on life support and near death, is now expected to make a full recovery. He was diagnosed with falciparum malaria, the very deadly strain which happens to be endemic in Haiti.The other soldiers are being treated for malaria at their units in Haiti.These cases of malaria come on the heels of a Naval Petty Officer who died from the parasitic disease after getting infected in Liberia last December.According to Army officials, all soldiers deployed to Haiti are given prophylactic doxycycline 48 hours before deployment. In addition, soldiers are supposed to have their uniforms treated with the insecticide, Permethrin. They are also given DEET to apply to their skin throughout the day.The problem however, according to military studies is non-compliance of the antibiotic prophylaxis regimen and the sporadic use of the other preventive measures.Insecticide treated bed nets are also supposed to be issued for deployed military personnel.In addition to malaria, a warrant officer also deployed to Haiti, became extremely ill after a bout of leptospirosis. This is a bacterial disease which people get when exposed to water that\u2019s contaminated with animal urine, particularly rat urine.

He became infected in Haiti where he and members of his congregation went to help earthquake victims.He was in Haiti the last week of January with 12 members of his congregation working on fixing a temporary shelter for orphan children destroyed in the earthquake.He died after at the medical center after returning to Santo Domingo.Currently the Ministry of Public Health of the Dominican Republic has put the preacher\u2019s relatives under close surveillance for meningococcal meningitis. In addition, the members of his evangelical mission are being located for prophylatic antibiotics.The Dominican government is working very hard trying to prevent meningococcal disease in their country. As I mentioned in my January 15th article, meningitis is a common ailment in Haiti.Meningococcal meningitis is caused by the bacterium, Neisseria meningitidis, which causes the most severe form of bacterial meningitis. Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It can also be found in the bloodstream. This particular type of meningitis is very severe and can result in death if not treated promptly. Even in cases where treatment has been given, the fatality rate is around 15%.The symptoms of bacterial meningitis are sudden, with fever, stiff neck, body aches and headaches. As the disease progresses other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, photophobia and seizures. A petechial rash seen on the trunk and lower extremities, bleeding complications, multi-organ failures and shock are usually final signs. This disease has the ability to kill within hours of getting it.Up to 10-20% of older children and young adults carry this organism in the mouth and nose, though the carriage rate will vary with age and closeness of population. The majority of people that carry this bacterium have no clinical disease. The organism is spread person to person through respiratory secretions from the nose and mouth (coughing, sneezing and kissing). Experts are unsure why some people advance to meningitis disease while many do not.Crowded living conditions facilitate the spread of the organisms and places like military barracks and college dormitories are well documented areas of concern with this disease.Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "In a nation which even before the earthquake had health problems unimaginable for us in the United States, could turn out catastrophic in days to weeks to come.The country was already the poorest in the Western hemisphere with an average income hovering around $1000 annually and with the mortality of a child under 5 years old and the mortality of pregnant women being the highest in the area.Haiti was already plagued with incredible infectious disease issues like parasitic worms like Ascaris and hookworm infected large amounts of the population. Life-threatening falciparum malaria is endemic on the island nation. The island of Hispaniola is the only island in the Caribbean where this is true.Diarrheal diseases, bacterial, viral and parasitic, are one of the most common causes of infant mortality.\nSo why will the situation likely worsen in coming days. First, there will be even more severe malnutrition than before the earthquake. Food may be scarce and having food may make you a victim to the street thugs who will steal and maybe kill for the goods. With malnutrition comes susceptibility to many infections and anemia. There is already a history of poor Haitian people eating \u201cdirt\u201d pies which can be a rich source of intestinal roundworms.The lack of potable water may be the most devastating situation that could happen. With much homelessness and the water system basically out of commission; and proper sanitation completely lacking, diarrheal diseases like dysentery and the death that follows may grow exponentially.In addition, the crowding of people can\u2019t help the transmission of waterborne diarrheal diseases, crowding is also a haven for respiratory illness like influenza, tuberculosis and meningitis in which the later two are quite common in Haiti.With many people homeless and wandering the streets and sleeping outside, the chance for confrontation with rabid animals could increase.All this; no clean water, no sanitation system, crowding and crime will be compounded with a near total lack of any health care except what is provided by agencies like Doctors without Borders and foreign governments.But with a population of over 9 million, little to no infrastructure, and security at a premium, the people Haiti are in dire need of any and all help available.Your email address will not be published.

DOS can transmit herpes simplex virus (HSV) to newborn males which can cause severe infection, resulting in brain damage, and death.Since April 2006, when neonatal herpes reporting became mandatory in NYC, there has been a total of 169 babies (male and female) with laboratory-confirmed neonatal herpes infection. Among these, 22 (13%) developed their infections following ritual Jewish circumcision.Signs and symptoms may include: a vesicular or pustular rash (following DOS, these lesions typically appear on the genitals, groin, buttocks and ankle; fever; poor feeding; irritability; and lethargy. Fever and rash are not always present so, a historical exposure such as DOS should raise suspicion for an atypical presentation of neonatal herpes.Got Smallpox?Your email address will not be published.

In 2018, Houston ranked first (at 88 percent) in Harris County for all reported congenital syphilis cases.In 2018, Texas saw increased cases of syphilis in women of childbearing age along with a rise in congenital syphilis cases. The number of congenital syphilis cases in Texas increased 124 percent between 2017 (164 cases) and 2018 (367 cases), led by Harris County.This is the largest number of congenital syphilis cases reported annually in Texas in more than 20 years.The new campaign, called \u201cMy Prenatal Promise,\u201d targets women of childbearing age (16-44), and emphasizes the importance of prenatal care and getting tested three times for syphilis, as required by Texas state law. The goals are to increase awareness about prenatal care and its link to the prevention of congenital syphilis, to promote the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of syphilis and to educate and encourage women to get tested for syphilis, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) during pregnancy. The campaign emphasizes three actions: \u201cTalk, Test and Treat.\u201dThe first action, \u201ctalk,\u201d urges expectant mothers \u2014 preferably accompanied by the fathers of the unborn babies \u2014 to specifically discuss STI testing with their doctors. The second action, \u201ctest,\u201d urges taking all necessary tests to detect syphilis, HIV or other STIs. The third action, \u201ctreat,\u201d urges expectant mothers to get treated immediately if diagnosed with syphilis.Congenital syphilis is an infectious disease transmitted by an infected mother to her baby in the womb. Adults transmit syphilis through sexual contact but mothers can transmit the infection to their baby in the womb or through the birthing process. The disease can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, death shortly after birth, prematurity and birth defects. A woman can be treated and cured for syphilis during pregnancy, but it is important for women to be tested in time for treatment to be effective. Babies who test positive for syphilis at birth must be treated immediately to prevent serious health issues.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"26690f7d7d3af5efc30c0cfb686742f1\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B00ANRUELK,0029166764\";Your email address will not be published.

Treatment with Palforzia may be initiated in individuals ages 4 through 17 years with a confirmed diagnosis of peanut allergy and may be continued in individuals 4 years of age and older. Those who take Palforzia must continue to avoid peanuts in their diets.\u201cPeanut allergy affects approximately 1 million children in the U.S. and only 1 out of 5 of these children will outgrow their allergy. Because there is no cure, allergic individuals must strictly avoid exposure to prevent severe and potentially life-threatening reactions,\u201d\u00a0said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.\u00a0\u201cEven with strict avoidance, inadvertent exposures can and do occur. When used in conjunction with peanut avoidance, Palforzia provides an FDA-approved treatment option to help reduce the risk of these allergic reactions in children with peanut allergy.\u201dPeanut allergy is a condition in which the body\u2019s immune system mistakenly identifies even small amounts of peanut as harmful. Allergic reactions to peanut are unpredictable in occurrence and in how they present, with some individuals experiencing severe reactions from even trace amounts. Physical symptoms can develop within seconds of exposure and may include skin reactions (e.g., hives, redness or swelling), digestive discomfort, or more dangerous reactions, such as constriction of the throat and airways, and loss of adequate blood flow to vital organs of the body. Antihistamines and epinephrine can be used to treat allergic reactions, but severe reactions can \u00a0be fatal even with appropriate, prompt treatment. Palforzia cannot be used for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.Palforzia is a powder that is manufactured from peanuts and packaged in pull-apart color-coded capsules for Dose Escalation and Up-Dosing, and in a sachet for maintenance treatment. The powder is emptied from the capsules or sachet and mixed with a small amount of semisolid food \u2013 such as applesauce, yogurt, or pudding \u2013 that the patient then consumes.The FDA granted approval of Palforzia to Aimmune Therapeutics.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"a8df8be929068db7c544606d7839c7d6\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B007D4R4ZK,B01LQBIWQ0,B00MXOVBO0,B01LR0W7Z2\";Your email address will not be published.

Ruminants such as bison, cattle, sheep and goats are highly susceptible, and horses can also be infected.Anthrax is a very serious\u00a0disease\u00a0of livestock because it can potentially cause the rapid\u00a0loss\u00a0of a large number of\u00a0animals\u00a0in a\u00a0very short\u00a0time.

People get anthrax by handling contaminated\u00a0animal\u00a0or\u00a0animal\u00a0products, consuming undercooked meat of infected\u00a0animals\u00a0and more recently, intentional release of spores.Subscribe to Outbreak News TV on YouTubeThere are three\u00a0types\u00a0of human anthrax with differing degrees of seriousness: cutaneous,\u00a0gastrointestinal\u00a0and\u00a0inhalation.Your email address will not be published.

In 2014, an 11-year-old boy from Florida contracted the amoeba while vacationing in the country. He later died after returning home.Naegleria fowleri \u00a0is a microscopic amoeba which is a single-celled\u00a0living organism. It can cause a\u00a0rare and\u00a0devastating\u00a0infection\u00a0of the\u00a0brain\u00a0called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). The amoeba is commonly found in warm freshwater such as lakes, rivers,\u00a0ponds\u00a0and canals.\u00a0Infections\u00a0can happen when contaminated water enters the body through\u00a0the nose. Once the amoeba enters\u00a0the nose, it travels to the\u00a0brain\u00a0where it causes PAM (which destroys\u00a0brain\u00a0tissue) and is usually fatal.\u00a0Infections\u00a0usually occur when it is hot for prolonged periods of time, which results in higher water temperatures and lower water levels.Subscribe to Outbreak News TV on YouTubeNaegleria fowleri\u00a0infections\u00a0are rare.\u00a0Most\u00a0\u00a0infections\u00a0occur from exposure to contaminated recreational water. Cases due to the use of neti pots and the practice of ablution have been\u00a0documented. You cannot be\u00a0infected\u00a0with Naegleria fowleri by drinking contaminated water and the amoeba is not found in salt water.Initial\u00a0symptoms\u00a0of PAM usually start within 1 to 7 days after\u00a0infection. The initial\u00a0symptoms\u00a0may include\u00a0headache, fever, nausea, or vomiting. Other\u00a0symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, seizures, and\u00a0hallucinations. After the start of\u00a0symptoms, the\u00a0disease\u00a0progresses rapidly.What was the name of the Thermal Springs at Bagaces de Guayabo?

            "content": "Finally, some good news has emerged about the novel coronavirus that has spread to about 50 countries across the world. Chinese professors report in the journal\u00a0Frontiers in Pediatrics\u00a0that it doesn\u2019t appear that the viral infection is transmittable from pregnant mothers to newborns at birth.The study is the second out of China within the last month to confirm that mothers infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy did not infect their babies.All four mothers in the current study, which focused on the health of the newborns, gave birth at Wuhan\u2019s Union Hospital while infected. Wuhan in Hubei Province is believed to be the epicenter of the current outbreak that has sickened more than 100,000 people worldwide and killed more than 3,400 \u2014 most of them in China.None of the infants developed any serious symptoms associated with COVID-19 such as fever or cough, though all were initially isolated in neonatal intensive care units and fed formula. Three of the four tested negative for the respiratory infection following a throat swab, while the fourth child\u2019s mother declined permission for the test.One newborn did experience a minor breathing issue for three days that was treated by non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Two babies, including the one with a respiratory problem, did have body rashes that eventually disappeared on their own.It\u2019s impossible to conclude whether there\u2019s a connection between these other medical issues and COVID-19. \u201cWe are not sure the rash was due to the mother\u2019s COVID-19 infection,\u201d said study co-author\u00a0Dr. Yalan Liu\u00a0at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. She also works in the Department of Pediatric at Union Hospital.All four infants remain healthy, and their mothers also fully recovered.In the previous retrospective study on nine pregnant mothers\u00a0infected with COVID-19, researchers also found no evidence that the viral infection can pass to the child. All nine births were done by cesarean section. Three of the four pregnancies in the current study were also brought to term by C-section.\u201cTo avoid infections caused by perinatal and postnatal transmission, our obstetricians think that C-section may be safer,\u201d Liu said. \u201cOnly one pregnant mother adopted vaginal delivery because of the onset of the labor process. The baby was normal. Maybe vaginal delivery is OK. It needs further study.\u201dIn previous coronavirus outbreaks, scientists found no evidence of viral transmission from mother to child, but SARS and MERS were both associated with \u201ccritical maternal illness, spontaneous abortion, or even maternal death,\u201d according to Liu.Globally, an estimated 3.4 percent of reported COVID-19 cases have died, according to the latest data from the World Health Organization. In comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1 percent of those infected. However, COVID-19 does not appear to spread as easily as influenza. Note that transmission and fatality rates are currently subject to change and revision as more research is done on the virus.The authors said further investigations into other aspects of potential COVID-19 infection in newborns and children are needed. For example, the sensitivity of the current diagnostic test for detecting the virus is about 71 percent, so they suggest evaluating its reliability in children.Toward that end, the researchers are collecting additional samples from the newborns, including placenta, amniotic fluid, neonatal blood and gastric fluid, among others, to detect possible receptors for the virus.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"f9ce7c770e456852c19d99cb1c1a691c\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B01EWG3OO6,B01L9E529E,B005OK3GUW,B081BC7QKK,B000NOC52Y,B00G3GJI7G,B06WGMPQRX,B07Z6MN2VD\";Your email address will not be published.

The detection occurred in the Central Tablelands on a property with no previous record of anthrax. The affected animals were ewes that had not been vaccinated for anthrax.This has prompted DPI to urge producers to vaccinate their livestock.Biosecurity measures at the affected property, including stock movement restrictions and the vaccination of remaining livestock were immediately imposed.DPI Senior Veterinary Officer, Dr Graham Bailey said while there are no general public health risks or trade implications from the detection it served as a timely reminder.\u201cDrought conditions create a favourable environment for anthrax infections so producers should consider vaccination to protect their livestock,\u201d Dr Bailey said.\u201cIngestion of soil by sheep, cattle and other ruminants is one of the key risk factors for anthrax, which is why drought conditions increase the risk.\u201cCases of anthrax in NSW tend to occur in an area which runs through the centre of\u00a0the state, between Bourke and Moree in the north, to Albury and Deniliquin in the\u00a0south.\u201cAnthrax can be prevented by annual vaccination of cattle and sheep. Producers in\u00a0high risk locations are encouraged to consider vaccination.\u201dOther risk factors include a history of anthrax on the property, grazing stubble or very\u00a0short pastures, low ground cover, deep cultivation or earthworks in paddocks, soil movement or exposure as a result of rain, contact with infected carcasses and alkaline soils which favour spore survival.Your email address will not be published.

Laboratory testing done at CDC confirmed this diagnosis.\u00a0This individual is in good condition and is isolated to prevent spread of infection to others. Our best wishes go to the employee for a rapid and full recovery.This individual was not involved in the COVID-19 response, has not been present in the CDC workplace since March 6, and was asymptomatic at that time. Staff working in the same unit are teleworking while we will do a deep cleaning of the office space.After developing symptoms, the individual took the appropriate action and stayed home. CDC will handle each case with the utmost respect to privacy, while also informing potentially affected staff and taking swift measures to mitigate spread of the virus.At the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the agency informed its staff early Sunday morning that it has its first known case of an NIH staff member who has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. NIH has reported the case to state and local public health officials. While this is an unfortunate development, it is not surprising, and NIH expects that there will be more cases of infection among NIH staff.The individual works for the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases but is not involved in patient care. The individual is quarantined at home and doing well. Importantly, the individual was asymptomatic while at work, which is believed to lower the risk of transmission. After developing symptoms, the individual took the appropriate action, stayed home and called the NIH Occupational Medical Service (OMS), which is managing potential COVID-19 infection among NIH staff. OMS arranged testing, and the result was positive.\u00a0NIH commends the infected individual for following the NIH guidance, which has allowed us to take swift action.OMS and the NIH Clinical Center Hospital Epidemiology Service have identified staff who work in close proximity to this individual and may have been exposed. Those individuals have been contacted and will be screened for symptoms as soon as possible and asked to self-quarantine at home if their exposure constitutes a significant risk of infection according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. OMS will monitor them closely for infection.Your email address will not be published.

It\u00a0has already accepted the documentation of 43 African countries with only Cameroon, Central African Republic, Nigeria, and South Sudan remaining.For its final field verification visit in Nigeria, the ARCC visited selected health facilities at Central, State, Local Government Authority and Ward levels in the states of Kwara, Kogi in the North Central Zone; Borno and Bauchi in the North East Zone; and Kano and Sokoto in the North West Zone.\u201cThis verification visit is an opportunity for Nigeria to demonstrate to the rest of the world that it is on the verge of ending the chapter of wild poliovirus from its history.

This brings the total cases to 10 in the country.After submitting more than 30 people to\u00a0\u00a0diagnostic tests, following the protocols established by the World Health Organization (WHO), eight new ones infected with the virus were detected\u00a0, reported sector vice president Jorge Rodr\u00edguez.\u201cWe have to report, in a responsible way, that eight of more than those 30 cases evaluated today were positive for Coronavirus,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez from the Government Palace.He pointed out that six of these eight people are men and two women, of which three are from Spain, two from the US, one from Colombia (C\u00facuta) and two Venezuelans who were secondarily infected.The cases are being attended with the rigor that they deserve, stressed the also Minister of Communication and Information, while detailing that four of these people are located in the Miranda state, one in Aragua, one in Apure, one in Cojedes and the eighth person is a citizen of Spanish origin cabin crew.In addition, prior to reporting any cases,\u00a0 the National Government declared a permanent emergency in the National Public Health System in order to establish mechanisms for the prevention and containment of the coronavirus (COVID-19).\u201cI have decided to declare the Health System a permanent emergency for prevention, protection and to fully prepare them in all their capacities to attend to cases that, at some point, are detected anywhere in the country,\u201d announced the president of the Republic, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.From the Miraflores Palace, located in Caracas, he explained that 46 hospital centers are empowered to \u201cconduct and exercise stewardship in the coronavirus care processes throughout the national territory.\u201dOn Saturday, officials said 4,800 beds were arranged in 572 Comprehensive Diagnostic Centers (CDI) throughout the country.In Colombia, the government of President Ivan Duque announced late Friday that non-nationals would be barred from entering the country from March 16 if they have been in Europe or Asia over the past two weeks. It also announced the closure of the border with Venezuela, prompting fears of what such measures may mean for those who rely on medicine, medical supplies and other goods from Colombia.Colombia has reported 22 COVID-19 cases to date.Venezuela slammed the decision as \u201can act of gross irresponsibility\u201d.More than 4.8 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, and over 1.7 million now reside in Colombia, according to the United Nations\u2019s most recent figures.Chagas in Black and WhiteYour email address will not be published.

The findings based on a computer model of the outbreak are published online in the journal\u00a0Science.The researchers report:\u201cThe explosion of COVID-19 cases in China was largely driven by individuals with mild, limited, or no symptoms who went undetected,\u201d says co-author Jeffrey Shaman, PhD, professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University Mailman School. \u201cDepending on their contagiousness and numbers, undetected cases can expose a far greater portion of the population to virus than would otherwise occur. We find for COVID-19 in China these undetected infected individuals are numerous and contagious. These stealth transmissions will continue to present a major challenge to the containment of this outbreak going forward.\u201dThe researchers used a computer model that draws on observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data from January 10-23 and January 24-February 8. They caution that major changes to care-seeking or patient documentation practices, as well as rapid developments with regard to travel restrictions and control measures, may make predictions difficult.\u201cHeightened awareness of the outbreak, increased use of personal protective measures, and travel restriction have helped reduce the overall force of infection; however, it is unclear whether this reduction will be sufficient to fully stem the virus spread,\u201d says Shaman. \u201cIf the novel coronavirus follows the pattern of 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, it will also spread globally and become a fifth endemic coronavirus within the human population.\u201dA version of the article was posted in February in\u00a0medRxiv, a preprint server for health sciences.Outbreak News MerchandiseYour email address will not be published.

Hahn, M.D.\u201cOur device center has been in continual contact with the medical device community, in particular diagnostic developers, since January \u2014 providing technical assistance to test developers to help facilitate the availability and distribution of tests so that health care professionals can accurately detect the COVID-19 virus.\u201cSince the beginning of this outbreak, more than 90 test developers have sought FDA guidance with the development and validation of tests they plan to bring through the EUA process. Additionally, more than 40 laboratories have notified us that they are testing or intend to begin testing soon under our new policy for laboratory-developed tests for this emergency. We stand ready to continue to support medical products in the pipeline to fight this virus.\u201dHologic began research for a new coronavirus test as soon as the COVID-19 outbreak emerged in China. Since January, our company\u2019s development and manufacturing teams have worked around the clock to create the test, which runs on Hologic\u2019s Panther Fusion system, and prepare for its market rollout.\u201cWe at Hologic feel incredibly proud to be right on the leading edge of testing breakthroughs that will help lead the world out of this COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Steve MacMillan, Chairman, President and CEO of Hologic.Now, Hologic can immediately begin shipping the product to labs across the United States. Starting in April, we expect to make almost 600,000 of these tests per month.Panther Fusion, launched about three years ago, automates the complex steps involved in molecular diagnostics. This automation not only speeds up diagnostics but also reduces the chances for error when compared to the traditional lab setup, which has many manual processes.Panther Fusion is also distinctive because of its high testing throughput, small footprint compared to other high-throughput competitors and versatility in being able to run 16 different FDA-approved tests.Your email address will not be published.

In that statement, we indicated that the second patient is a direct contact of the first. We further indicated that they were a group of 10 people who had travelled to Italy.We confirm that we traced all 10 of these individuals. Nine of them had returned to South Africa. The tenth did not and is therefore not in our country.This morning we have received results of the direct contact of the first patient, his wife.

However, as part of taking extra precautions, these children will remain in self-quarantine until their parents have tested negative. At that point, they will also be tested to ensure that they remain negative. Until then they will be regarded as potentially infected. This means they will continue not attend school. This is in an effort to curb the risk of spread to other children and teachers.This morning, I had an opportunity to speak to the first confirmed patient. He was upbeat and jovial. I also spoke to the doctor who is treating him. She confirmed that this patient is responding well and is now asymptomatic. At the right time, as determined by the treating doctors, the patient will be retested to check his recovery progress.Robert Koch QuoteYour email address will not be published.

Therefore, we have increased the sensitivity of surveillance in the search for a supposed community transmission of the coronavirus, which will allow us to organize our system better and faster. operational \u201c, said the executive secretary of the Ministry of Health, Jo\u00e3o Gabbardo.The tests for coronavirus will be performed on people who have not traveled abroad or had contact in Brazil with confirmed cases.\u00a0In this situation, patients hospitalized in cities with already confirmed cases of coronavirus and who have a severe condition, ie Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), will be investigated.As of Monday, there are 25 confirmed cases of the disease, 4 by local transmission and 21 imported cases in Brazil.Currently, 930 suspected cases are monitored and another 685 have already been discarded.Of the 25 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country, 16 are in S\u00e3o Paulo, 3 in Rio de Janeiro, 2 in Bahia, 01 in Alagoas, 01 in Esp\u00edrito Santo, 01 in Minas Gerais and 01 in the Federal District.Got Smallpox?In addition, The Ministry of Health reversed the order of the target audience of the National Influenza Vaccination Campaign.\u00a0First, the elderly and health workers, who work at the forefront of service to the population, will be vaccinated.\u00a0The decision of the portfolio is yet another measure of protection for these audiences, especially for the elderly, since the vaccine is a protection for the most common respiratory diseases, which depending on the severity can lead to death.\u00a0Another concern is to prevent people over 60, the public most vulnerable to coronavirus, from having to travel in the expected period of likely circulation of the virus in the country.\u00a0The first phase of the campaign begins on March 23, throughout Brazil.The prioritization of the elderly in this first stage, despite the ineffectiveness of the Influenza vaccine against coronavirus, is a way of helping health professionals to discard influences in the screening and speed up the diagnosis for COVID-19. In addition, the folder considers studies and data that point out that more serious cases of coronavirus infection have been recorded in people over 60 years of age.\u201cWe need to protect the most vulnerable and those who are at the forefront of care.\u00a0It is important to ensure that these people have access to information to avoid queues at health posts.\u00a0Our challenge is to carry out the campaign safely and avoid agglomerations.\u00a0The National Immunization Program of Brazil (PNI) is prepared \u201d, explained the Secretary for Surveillance and Health of the Ministry of Health, Wanderson de Oliveira.Your email address will not be published.

The illness often begins suddenly. Even after having the illness, you can still become re-infected by norovirus. The main symptoms of norovirus illness are diarrhea, vomiting (children usually experience more vomiting than adults), nausea and stomach cramps. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, headache, chills, muscle aches and fatigue (a general sense of tiredness). Most people feel better within one or two days, with symptoms resolving on their own, and experience no long-term health effects. As with any illness causing diarrhea or vomiting, people who are ill should drink plenty of liquids to replace lost body fluids and prevent dehydration. In severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized and given fluids intravenously.Officials advise the public to check to see if you have the recalled product in your home.

FLUAD QUADRIVALENT includes an additional strain to FLUAD, which has an extensive clinical legacy, with 114+ million doses distributed and licensure in 29 countries since it was first approved in 1997.\u201cThe burden of seasonal influenza among\u00a0adults 65 and older,\u00a0remains an important public health concern,\u201d said\u00a0Gregg Sylvester, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Seqirus. \u201cAt Seqirus, we\u2019re committed to developing advanced technologies and vaccines designed to address unmet needs, especially in vulnerable populations, such as adults 65 years and older.\u201dAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), everyone who is six months and older should receive an annual flu shot, but it is particularly important for those 65 years and older who are at risk of developing serious complications from influenza.FLUAD QUADRIVALENT and FLUAD are the first-and-only adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines approved in the U.S. for adults 65 years and older.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"8063f04fe88d181454c6cad15e7be65e\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07L5GGSRJ,B06XZTZ7GB\";Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "People who rely on social media for information were more likely to be misinformed about vaccines than those who rely on traditional media, according to a study of vaccine knowledge and media use by researchers at the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.The study, based on nationally representative surveys of nearly 2,500 U.S. adults, found that up to 20% of respondents were at least somewhat misinformed about vaccines. Such a high level of misinformation is \u201cworrying\u201d because misinformation undermines vaccination rates, and high vaccination rates are required to maintain community immunity, the researchers said.The study, published in the\u00a0Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review, was conducted in the spring and fall of 2019, when the United States experienced its largest measles outbreak in a quarter century. Between the two survey periods, 19% of the respondents\u2019 levels of vaccine misinformation changed in a substantive way \u2013 and within that group, almost two-thirds (64%) were more misinformed in the fall than in the spring.Media consumption patterns helped to explain the change in misinformation levels, the researchers found. Those respondents who reported increased exposure to information about measles and the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine on social media were more likely to grow more misinformed about vaccines. By contrast, those people who reported an increased exposure to news accounts about those topics in traditional media were more likely to grow less misinformed about vaccines.\u201cPeople who received their information from traditional media were less likely to endorse common anti-vaccination claims,\u201d said lead author Dominik Stecula, a postdoctoral fellow in the science of science communication program at the Annenberg Public Policy Center (APPC). He co-authored the study with Ozan Kuru, another APPC postdoctoral fellow, and APPC Director Kathleen Hall Jamieson.The result is consistent with research suggesting that social media contain a fair amount of misinformation about vaccination while traditional media are more likely to reflect the scientific consensus on its benefits and safety, according to the Annenberg researchers.\u2018Worrying\u2019 levels of vaccine misinformationThe researchers found that:Medical experts and media consumptionThe researchers also found that an individual\u2019s level of trust in medical experts affects the likelihood that a person\u2019s beliefs about vaccination will change. Low levels of trust in medical experts coincide with believing vaccine misinformation, the researchers said.In addition, the research found that vaccine misinformation proved resilient over time. Most of those in the sample (81%) were just as informed or misinformed in the spring (February/March) as they were months later, in the fall (September/October), despite the extensive news coverage of the measles outbreak and attempts by the CDC to educate the public. Among the 19% whose level of knowledge changed substantially, 64% were more misinformed and 36% were better informed.The researchers point out that although the findings only show correlations between media coverage and individual attitudes \u2013 not causation \u2013 these findings still hold implications for the effectiveness of national pro-vaccination campaigns, the role of health professionals in addressing misinformation, and the impact of social media misinformation.The findings, Kuru noted, come as a number of states have been debating whether to tighten their laws surrounding vaccination exemptions and social media companies have been wrestling with how to respond to different forms of misinformation.The researchers said this study suggests that \u201cincreasing the sheer amount of pro-vaccination content in media of all types may be of value over the longer term.\u201d They said the findings also underscore the importance of decisions by Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Pinterest to reduce or block access to anti-vaccine misinformation.Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "For decades, the routine treatment for Lyme disease has been standard antibiotics, which usually kill off the infection. But for up to 20% of people with the tick-borne illness, the antibiotics don\u2019t work, and lingering symptoms of muscle pain, fatigue and cognitive impairment can continue for years \u2014 sometimes indefinitely.A new\u00a0Stanford Medicine\u00a0study in lab dishes and mice provides evidence that the drug\u00a0azlocillin completely kills off the disease-causing bacteria\u00a0Borrelia burgdorferi\u00a0at the onset of the illness. The study suggests it could also be effective for treating patients infected with drug-tolerant bacteria that may cause lingering symptoms.\u201cThis compound is just amazing,\u201d said\u00a0Jayakumar Rajadas, PhD, assistant professor of medicine and director of the Biomaterials and Advanced Drug Delivery Laboratory at the Stanford School of Medicine. \u201cIt clears the infection without a lot of side effects. We are hoping to repurpose it as an oral treatment for Lyme disease.\u201d Rajadas is the senior author of the\u00a0study, which was published online March 2 in\u00a0Scientific Reports. The lead author is research associate Venkata Raveendra Pothineni, PhD.\u201cWe have been screening potential drugs for six years,\u201d Pothineni said. \u201cWe\u2019ve screened almost 8,000 chemical compounds. We have tested 50 molecules in the dish. The most effective and safest molecules were tested in animal models. Along the way, I\u2019ve met many people suffering with this horrible, lingering disease.

            "content": "Infectious disease researchers at The University of Texas at Austin studying the novel coronavirus were able to identify how quickly the virus can spread, a factor that may help public health officials in their efforts at containment. They found that time between cases in a chain of transmission is less than a week and that more than 10% of patients are infected by somebody who has the virus but does not yet have symptoms.In the paper in press with the journal\u00a0Emerging Infectious Diseases, a team of scientists from the United States, France, China and Hong Kong were able to calculate what\u2019s called the serial interval of the virus. To measure serial interval, scientists look at the time it takes for symptoms to appear in two people with the virus: the person who infects another, and the infected second person.Researchers found that the average serial interval for the novel coronavirus in China was approximately four days. This also is among the first studies to estimate the rate of asymptomatic transmission.The speed of an epidemic depends on two things \u2014 how many people each case infects and how long it takes cases to spread. The first quantity is called the reproduction number; the second is the serial interval. The short serial interval of COVID-19 means emerging outbreaks will grow quickly and could be difficult to stop, the researchers said.\u201cEbola, with a serial interval of several weeks, is much easier to contain than influenza, with a serial interval of only a few days. Public health responders to Ebola outbreaks have much more time to identify and isolate cases before they infect others,\u201d said Lauren Ancel Meyers, a professor of integrative biology at UT Austin. \u201cThe data suggest that this coronavirus may spread like the flu. That means we need to move quickly and aggressively to curb the emerging threat.\u201dMeyers and her team examined more than 450 infection case reports from 93 cities in China and found the strongest evidence yet that people without symptoms must be transmitting the virus, known as pre-symptomatic transmission. According to the paper, more than 1 in 10 infections were from people who had the virus but did not yet feel sick.Previously, researchers had some uncertainty about asymptomatic transmission with the coronavirus. This new evidence could provide guidance to public health officials on how to contain the spread of the disease.\u201cThis provides evidence that extensive control measures including isolation, quarantine, school closures, travel restrictions and cancellation of mass gatherings may be warranted,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cAsymptomatic transmission definitely makes containment more difficult.\u201dMeyers pointed out that with hundreds of new cases emerging around the world every day, the data may offer a different picture over time. Infection case reports are based on people\u2019s memories of where they went and whom they had contact with. If health officials move quickly to isolate patients, that may also skew the data.\u201cOur findings are corroborated by instances of silent transmission and rising case counts in hundreds of cities worldwide,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cThis tells us that COVID-19 outbreaks can be elusive and require extreme measures.\u201dYour email address will not be published.

Data indicate a similar trend in Iowa. The number of individuals diagnosed with these early stages of syphilis who reported having used methamphetamine more than doubled from 2016-2018.

            "content": "A group of University of Alberta researchers who have discovered why the drug remdesivir is effective in treating the coronaviruses that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) expect it might also be effective for treating patients infected with the new COVID-19 strain.\u201cEven if you know a drug works, it can be a red flag if you don\u2019t know how it works,\u201d said virologist Matthias G\u00f6tte. \u201cIt is reassuring if you know exactly how it works against the target.\u201cWe know the drug works against different coronaviruses, like MERS and SARS, and we know the novel coronavirus is very similar to SARS. So I would say I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that the results our team found with remdesivir and MERS will be similar with COVID-19.\u201dThe study, published in the\u00a0Journal of Biological Chemistry\u00a0this week, is among the first in Canada to discuss the COVID-19 strain.Until now, there has not been a published explanation of why remdesivir may work against coronaviruses, said G\u00f6tte, who added his study is an important step in answering that question.Developed by Gilead Sciences as a response to the 2014 West African Ebola virus epidemic, remdesivir was first used on a patient with the novel coronavirus earlier this year in the United States.As reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, the patient was given the drug on the seventh day of illness, and showed marked improvement the following day, with symptoms eventually disappearing altogether. And at a recent press conference in Beijing, the assistant director-general of the World Health Organization, Bruce Alyward, said remdesivir is the only drug available that may have real efficacy against COVID-19.\u201cWhat our study showed was that remdesivir essentially mimics one of the natural building blocks for RNA synthesis necessary for genome replication of the virus. Enzymes within the virus are synthesizing the viral RNA genome with these building blocks, but they mix up the bits they need with the drug. Once the drug is incorporated into the growing RNA chain, the virus can no longer replicate,\u201dexplained G\u00f6tte.He said the next step is to wait for results from ongoing clinical trials with remdesivir, which are expected by the end of April. Even then, that won\u2019t be the end of the story, he cautioned.\u201cIt\u2019s likely we\u2019ll need more than one drug to properly fight emerging diseases like COVID-19, as we have with HIV and hepatitis C virus infections,\u201d G\u00f6tte said.\u201cIdeally, we will have a couple of drugs because certain strains could be resistant to certain treatments.\u201dYour email address will not be published.

            "content": "By NewsDesk\u00a0\u00a0@infectiousdiseasenewsOn Thursday, FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. addressed the issues and impact of the COVID-19 outbreak has had on the medical product supply chain:As I have previously communicated, the FDA has been closely monitoring the supply chain with the expectation that\u00a0the COVID-19 outbreak would likely impact the medical product supply chain, including potential disruptions to supply or shortages of critical medical products in the U.S.A manufacturer has alerted us to a shortage of a human drug that was recently added to the drug shortages list. The manufacturer just notified us that this shortage is related to a site affected by coronavirus. The shortage is due to an issue with manufacturing of an active pharmaceutical ingredient used in the drug.\u00a0 It is important to note that there are other alternatives that can be used by patients. We are working with the manufacturer as well as other manufacturers to mitigate the shortage. We will do everything possible to mitigate the shortage.Additional Information on Human DrugsSince January 24, the FDA has been in touch with more than 180 manufacturers of human drugs, not only to remind them of applicable legal requirements for notifying the FDA of any anticipated supply disruptions, but also asking them to evaluate their entire supply chain, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (the main ingredient in the drug and part that produces the intended effects, e.g., acetaminophen) and other components manufactured in China.Also, as part of our efforts, the FDA has identified about 20 other drugs, which solely source their active pharmaceutical ingredients or finished drug products from China. We have been in contact with those firms to assess whether they face any drug shortage risks due to the outbreak. None of these firms have reported any shortage to date. Also, these drugs are considered non-critical drugs.We will remain in contact with manufacturers so that we can continue to assist them with any potential issues in the fastest way.Medical DevicesWe are aware of 63 manufacturers which represent 72 facilities in China that produce essential medical devices; we have contacted all of them. Essential devices are those that may be prone to potential shortage if there is a supply disruption. We are aware that several of these facilities in China are adversely affected by COVID-19, citing workforce challenges, including the necessary quarantine of workers. While the FDA continues to assess whether manufacturing disruptions will affect overall market availability of these products, there are currently no reported shortages for these types of medical devices within the U.S. market.Regarding personal protective equipment\u2014surgical gowns, gloves, masks, respirator protective devices, or other medical equipment designed to protect the wearer from injury or the spread of infection or illness\u2014the FDA has heard reports of increased market demand and supply challenges for some of these products.\u00a0 However, the FDA is currently not aware of specific widespread shortages of medical devices, but we are aware of reports from CDC and other U.S. partners of increased ordering of a range of human medical products through distributors as some healthcare facilities in the U.S. are preparing for potential needs if the outbreak becomes severe.It is important to note that no law exists requiring medical device manufacturers to notify the FDA when they become \u00a0aware of a circumstance, including discontinuation of a product, that could lead to a potential shortage, and manufacturers are not required to respond when the FDA requests information about potential supply chain disruption. As with prior emergencies, the FDA has taken proactive steps to establish and remain in contact with medical device manufacturers and others in the supply chain, including hospitals and group purchasing organizations. The agency also encourages manufacturers and healthcare facilities to report any supply disruptions to the device shortages mailbox,\u00a0deviceshortages@fda.hhs.gov. This mailbox is closely monitored and has proven to be a valuable surveillance resource to augment FDA efforts to detect and mitigate potential supply chain disruption.Biologics and Blood SupplyThe FDA is not aware of any cellular or gene therapies that are made in China for the U.S. market. There are no shortages of biologics to report at this time.The potential for transmission of COVID-19 by blood and blood components is unknown at this time; however, respiratory viruses, in general, are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion. Further, there have been no reported cases of transfusion-transmitted COVID-19.The FDA has made information available to blood establishments and to establishments that manufacture human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products that may wish to consider additional donor screening measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.FoodWe are not aware of any reports at this time of human illnesses that suggest COVID-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging. However, it is always important to follow\u00a0good hygiene\u00a0practices (i.e., wash hands and surfaces often, separate raw meat from other foods, cook to the right temperature, and refrigerate foods promptly) when handling or preparing foods.Animal DrugsThere are 32 animal drug firms that make finished drugs or source active pharmaceutical ingredients in China for the U.S. The FDA has contacted all 32 firms and no shortages have been reported at this time. However, six of those firms have indicated that they are seeing disruptions in the supply chain that soon could lead to shortages. The FDA is working with these firms to help identify interventions to mitigate potential shortages.Additional ResourcesThe FDA is using all our existing authorities to address COVID-19, and we welcome the opportunity to work with Congress to further strengthen our response capabilities and emergency preparedness. There are four specific proposals included in the President\u2019s budget that would better equip the FDA to prevent or mitigate medical product shortages.1.\u00a0Lengthen Expiration Dates to Mitigate Critical Human Drug Shortages: Shortages of certain critical drugs can be exacerbated when drugs must be discarded because they exceed a labeled shelf-life due to unnecessarily short expiration dates. By expanding the FDA\u2019s authority to require, when likely to help prevent or mitigate a shortage, that an applicant evaluate, submit studies to the FDA, and label a product with the longest possible expiration date that the FDA agrees is scientifically justified, there could be more supply available to alleviate the drug shortage or the severity of a shortage.2.\u00a0Improve Critical Infrastructure by Requiring Risk Management Plans: Enabling the FDA to require application holders of certain drugs to conduct periodic risk assessments to identify the vulnerabilities in their manufacturing supply chain (inclusive of contract manufacturing facilities), and develop plans to mitigate the risks associated with the identified vulnerabilities would enable the FDA to strengthen the supply chain by integrating contingencies for emergency situations. Currently, many medical product manufacturers lack plans to assess and address vulnerabilities in their manufacturing supply chain, putting them, and American patients, at risk for drug supply disruptions following disasters (e.g., hurricanes) or in other circumstances.3.\u00a0Improve Critical Infrastructure through Improved Data Sharing and Require More Accurate Supply Chain Information: Empowering the FDA to require information to assess critical infrastructure, as well as manufacturing quality and capacity, would facilitate more accurate and timely supply chain monitoring and improve our ability to recognize shortage signals.4.\u00a0Establish Reporting Requirements for Device Manufacturers: The FDA does not have the same authorities for medical device shortages as it does for drugs and biological products. For instance, medical device manufacturers are not required to notify the FDA when they become aware of a circumstance that could lead to a device shortage or meaningful disruption in the supply of that device in the U.S., nor are they required to respond to inquiries from the FDA about the availability of devices. Enabling the FDA to have timely and accurate information about likely or confirmed national shortages of essential devices would allow the agency to take steps to promote the continued availability of devices of public health importance. Among other things, the FDA proposes to require that firms notify the agency of an anticipated meaningful interruption in the supply of an essential device; require all manufacturers of devices determined to be essential to periodically provide the FDA with information about the manufacturing capacity of the essential devices they manufacture; and authorize the temporary importation of devices where the benefits of the device in mitigating a shortage outweigh the risks presented by the device that could otherwise result in denial of importation of the device into the U.S.Overall, this remains an evolving and very dynamic issue. We are committed to continuing to communicate with the public as we have further updates.We also continue to aggressively monitor the market for any firms marketing products with fraudulent COVID-19 diagnosis, prevention or treatment claims. The FDA can and will use every authority at our disposal to protect consumers from bad actors who take advantage of a crisis to deceive the public, including pursuing warning letters, seizures or injunctions against products on the market that are not in compliance with the law, or against firms or individuals who violate the law.We know the public may have questions or concerns for the FDA as a result of this outbreak, including you and your family\u2019s risk of exposure, or whether your critical medical products are safe and will continue to be available in the future. The FDA is working around the clock to monitor and mitigate emerging coronavirus issues through collaborative efforts with federal partners, international regulators \u00a0and medical product developers and manufacturers to help advance response efforts to combat the COVID-19 outbreak.I\u2019m 13 days into an 8 week series of Mavret for HC. The meds are ordered for 4 weeks, which I have & am taking but the second order for 4 more weeks will not be filled until April or May. How can I find out if my second shipment, if, actually, manufactured in & shipped from China will be coming and on time?  I can\u2019t break up the therapy, must be continuous, or it will not be effective to remove virus from blood. I haven\u2019t been able to get answers from Company, AbbieVie, or anyone else. Any info or answers appreciated. Thanks, C. GreeneYour email address will not be published.

            "content": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved an application for the first generic of Daraprim (pyrimethamine) tablets for the treatment of toxoplasmosis (an infection caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii) when used with a sulfonamide (a group of medicines used to treat bacterial infections).\u201cThe FDA has a longstanding commitment to increasing competition in markets with limited or no generic alternatives. Through the FDA\u2019s Drug Competition Action Plan, we\u2019ve worked to remove barriers in generic drug development by not only taking actions that improve the efficiency of the development, review and approval of generic drugs, but also by closing loopholes that allow brand-name drug companies to \u2018game\u2019 the rules in ways that delay generic competition that Congress intended,\u201d said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. \u201cEmpowering patients and promoting choice and competition are top priorities for the FDA. These important efforts include improving access to safe, effective and high-quality generic medications. Today\u2019s approval is especially important for populations that are more susceptible to toxoplasmosis infections, such as pregnant women and individuals with HIV or AIDS by paving the way for more choices in treatment options.\u201dToxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a single-celled parasite called Toxoplasma gondii that, when severe, can cause damage to the brain, eyes or other organs. A Toxoplasma infection can occur, among other ways, by eating undercooked, contaminated meat or shellfish; drinking water contaminated with Toxoplasma; or by accidental swallowing of the parasite through contact with cat feces that contain Toxoplasma. It is considered to be the leading cause of death attributed to foodborne illness in the United States.Severe toxoplasmosis is more likely in pregnant women and individuals who have weak immune systems, such as those with HIV or AIDS, those taking certain types of chemotherapy and those who have recently received an organ transplant. However, occasionally even persons with healthy immune systems may experience eye damage from toxoplasmosis.Addressing the challenges related to developing generics and promoting more generic competition is a key part of the FDA\u2019s Drug Competition Action Plan and the agency\u2019s efforts to help increase patient access to more affordable medicines. Generic prescription drugs approved by the FDA have the same safety and efficacy as brand-name drugs, and the manufacturing and packaging sites must pass the same quality standards as those of brand-name drugs. FDA analysis has shown that greater competition among generic drug makers is associated with lower generic drug prices.One area of focus under the action plan is improving the efficiency of the generic drug development, review and approval process, as well as closing loopholes that allow brand-name drug companies to delay the generic competition. As part of these important efforts, the FDA maintains a list of off-patent, off-exclusivity drug products without an approved generic to improve transparency and encourage the development and submission of applications for drugs with limited competition. Pyrimethamine is included on this list. The FDA also prioritizes the review of submissions for generic drugs for which there are fewer than three approved generic versions for the reference listed drug (RLD) and for which there are no blocking patents or exclusivities on the RLD.Additionally, certain \u201cgaming\u201d tactics have been used at times to delay generic competition. One example is when brand-name drug manufacturers attempt to prevent potential generic applicants from obtaining samples of certain medicines necessary to support approval of a generic drug application. To improve transparency about this issue, the FDA posted a list identifying all drugs for which the FDA has received an inquiry related to limited distribution of the reference drug from a prospective generic applicant. Daraprim is on this list.The most common side effects for pyrimethamine include hypersensitivity reactions (immune responses) that can occasionally be severe, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (two forms of the same life-threatening disease that causes rash, skin peeling and sores on the mucous membranes), erythema multiforme (a skin disorder with bulls-eye-shaped lesions), anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction that may include difficulty breathing and shock) and hyperphenylalaninemia (elevated concentration of the amino acid phenylalanine in the blood), particularly when pyrimethamine is administered at the same time as a sulfonamide. With doses of pyrimethamine used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis, anorexia and vomiting may occur. Doses used in toxoplasmosis may produce megaloblastic anemia (a condition in which the bone marrow produces unusually large, structurally abnormal, immature red blood cells), leukopenia (low white blood cell count), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count), pancytopenia (low counts of white and red blood cells, as well as platelets), neutropenia (low level of the white blood cells called neutrophils), atrophic glossitis (a condition of the tongue), hematuria (the presence of blood in urine) and disorders of cardiac rhythm. Hematologic (blood) effects, however, may also occur at low doses in certain individuals. Pulmonary eosinophilia (inflammation of the lungs from an increase in the white blood cell eosinophils) has been reported rarely.Giardia in Black and WhiteChagas in Black and WhitePyrimethamine should not be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to pyrimethamine or with documented megaloblastic anemia due to folate (a naturally-occurring B vitamin) deficiency. Women who are taking pyrimethamine should not become pregnant. Patients should keep pyrimethamine out of the reach of children.A small \u201cstarting\u201d dose for toxoplasmosis is recommended in patients with convulsive disorders to avoid the potential nervous system toxicity of pyrimethamine. Pyrimethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal (kidney) or hepatic (liver) function or in patients with possible folate deficiency, such as individuals with malabsorption syndrome, alcoholism or pregnancy, and those receiving therapy, such as phenytoin (an anti-epileptic drug), affecting folate levels.The sponsor of the approved generic version of Daraprim Tablets is Cerovene Inc.Your email address will not be published.

Within the scope of the agreement, Novartis is responsible for completing Phase I clinical trials. In addition, it will drive pharmaceutical development and regulatory submissions. Upon approval, Novartis has committed to distributing the drug on an affordable basis worldwide with a focus on maximizing access in endemic countries.DNDi will lead Phase II and Phase III clinical development, with the first Phase II study scheduled to start in early 2021 in India. Additional trials are planned to take place in East Africa, which has the highest burden of visceral leishmaniasis.\u201cExisting treatments for visceral leishmaniasis are simply not good enough. They are too long, increasingly ineffective, and can be toxic, painful, and costly,\u201d\u00a0said Dr Bernard P\u00e9coul, Executive Director of DNDi.\u00a0\u201cOur hope is to radically transform this by developing new oral drugs that are affordable, safe, effective, easy to take, and can also be adapted to meet the treatment needs of patients in different countries.\u201dOver one billion people worldwide are at risk of leishmaniasis, which is transmitted by the bite of a sandfly. Visceral leishmaniasis, also known as kala-azar, is the most serious form of leishmaniasis, causing fever, weight loss, spleen and liver enlargement, and if left untreated, death. There are an estimated 50 000 to 90 000 new cases per year. Treating the disease is complex as it is dependent on the species of infecting parasite and the country, as treatment responses differ from region to region.\u201cNovartis has a long-term commitment to neglected tropical diseases that spans several decades. Diseases caused by kinetoplastid parasites, such as leishmaniasis, are one of our strategic research priorities and, together with our partners, we have developed a promising portfolio of drug candidates,\u201d\u00a0said Dr Lutz Hegemann, Chief Operating Officer for Global Health at Novartis.\u00a0\u201cWe are excited to collaborate with DNDi to reimagine treatment options for people with leishmaniasis around the world.\u201damzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"817faa119ef5bfca4f6b523bce90ffd9\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1421420465,1555818749,1421427230,3039212532\";Broader partnershipsThe collaboration between DNDi and Novartis is aligned with a broader programme with Wellcome and other partners to develop new combinations of entirely new, all-orally acting chemical entities, to treat visceral leishmaniasis and cutaneous leishmaniasis, another form of the disease.The programme brings together a strong consortium of R&D partners, including the University of Dundee, GSK, Pfizer, TB Alliance, and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. These partners have built a portfolio of lead series, pre-clinical and clinical drug candidates, originating from different chemical classes with different mechanisms of action against leishmania parasites.\u201cWe are delighted to be partnering with Novartis from drug development to delivering a promising new oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis.

The trial regulatory sponsor is the\u00a0National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. This is the first clinical trial in the United States to evaluate an experimental treatment for COVID-19, the respiratory disease first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.The first trial participant is an American who was repatriated after being quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship that docked in Yokohama, Japan and volunteered to participate in the study. The study can be adapted to evaluate additional investigative treatments and to enroll participants at other sites in the U.S. and worldwide.There are no specific therapeutics approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat people with COVID-19, the disease caused by the newly emergent SARS-CoV-2 virus (formerly known as 2019-nCoV). Infection can cause mild to severe respiratory illness, and symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. As of February 24, the\u00a0World Health Organization (WHO)\u00a0has reported 77,262 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2,595 deaths in China and 2,069 cases of COVID-19 and 23 deaths in 29 other countries. There have been 14 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in the United States and an additional 39 cases among persons repatriated to the United States, according to the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Remdesivir, developed by Gilead Sciences Inc., is an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral treatment. It was previously tested in humans with Ebola virus disease and has\u00a0shown promise in animal models for treating Middle East respiratory syndrome\u00a0(MERS)\u00a0and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which are caused by other coronaviruses.\u201cWe urgently need a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19. Although remdesivir has been administered to some patients with COVID-19, we do not have solid data to indicate it can improve clinical outcomes,\u201d said NIAID Director and U.S. Coronavirus Task Force member Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. \u201cA randomized, placebo-controlled trial is the gold standard for determining if an experimental treatment can benefit patients.\u201dClinical trials of remdesivir are also ongoing in China. NIAID developed the current study taking those designs into account, and in accordance with consultations convened by the WHO on the development of a therapeutic trial for patients with COVID-19.Read more at NIHYour email address will not be published.

            "content": "SCYNEXIS, Inc., a biotechnology company delivering innovative therapies for difficult-to-treat and often life-threatening infections, today announced that it has completed patient enrollment in its global Phase 3 VANISH-306 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral ibrexafungerp as a treatment for women with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), commonly referred to as vaginal yeast infection. Ibrexafungerp, the first agent in a novel therapeutic class, is a broad-spectrum, IV/oral antifungal in late stage development for multiple indications, from the treatment and prevention of vaginal yeast infections to the treatment of\u00a0life-threatening fungal infections in hospitalized patients.\u201cVaginal yeast infections affect up to three out of four women at some point in their lifetimes, yet there is only one oral approved therapy that doesn\u2019t work for everyone, so we are committed to providing women with a novel oral alternative,\u201d said Marco Taglietti, M.D., president and chief executive officer of SCYNEXIS. \u201cWith enrollment now completed in this second pivotal Phase 3 trial (VANISH-306), and pending findings consistent with the previously reported positive results from our first Phase 3 study (VANISH-303), we remain on track to submit an NDA to the FDA for the treatment of VVC in the second half of 2020. Similar to the VANISH-303 study, the enrollment in this second study was completed about four months ahead of schedule, underscoring the global need for new vaginal yeast infection treatment options for both women and physicians.\u201dDr. Taglietti continued, \u201cWhile VANISH-303 and VANISH-306 are expected to provide the clinical evidence to support an indication for the treatment of VVC, enrollment continues in our CANDLE study for the prevention of recurrent VVC, with the potential for ibrexafungerp to be the first and only agent approved for both the treatment of vaginal yeast infections and prevention of recurrence. If approved, ibrexafungerp would represent the first new class of antifungals approved in over 20 years.\u201dThe VANISH-306 study enrolled 455 eligible subjects across the U.S. and Europe and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to a one-day treatment of either ibrexafungerp (two doses of 300-mg, 12 hours apart) or matching placebo. The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of subjects achieving a clinical cure at the test of cure visit. More information about this study can be found at:\u00a0https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03987620.Subscribe to Outbreak News TV on YouTubeVulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC), commonly known as a vaginal yeast infection due to\u00a0Candida, is the second most common cause of vaginitis. Although these infections are frequently caused by\u00a0Candida albicans, fluconazole-resistant\u00a0Candida\u00a0strains, such as\u00a0Candida glabrata, have been reported to become increasingly more common. VVC can be associated with substantial morbidity, including significant genital discomfort, reduced sexual pleasure, psychological distress and loss of productivity. Typical VVC symptoms include pruritus, vaginal soreness, irritation, excoriation of vaginal mucosa and abnormal vaginal discharge. An estimated 70-75% of women worldwide will have at least one episode of VVC in their lifetime, and 40-50% of them will experience two or more episodes. Approximately 6-8% of women with VVC suffer from recurrent disease, defined as experiencing at least three episodes within a 12-month period.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"27ef4c88191534848f77c7d8b674537c\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B074BLLV81,B012LO1TSO\";Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "The experimental antiviral remdesivir successfully prevented disease in rhesus macaques infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), according to a new study from National Institutes of Health scientists. Remdesivir prevented disease when administered before infection and improved the condition of macaques when given after the animals already were infected.The new report from NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) appears in the\u00a0Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.MERS-CoV is closely related to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that has grown to be a global public health emergency since cases were first detected in Wuhan, China, in December.Remdesivir has previously protected animals against a variety of viruses in lab experiments. The drug has been shown experimentally to effectively treat monkeys infected with Ebola and Nipah viruses. Remdesivir also has been investigated as a treatment for Ebola virus disease in people.Got Smallpox?The current study was conducted at NIAID\u2019s Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana. The work involved three groups of animals: those treated with remdesivir 24 hours before infection with MERS-CoV; those treated 12 hours after infection (close to the peak time for MERS-CoV replication in these animals); and untreated control animals.The scientists observed the animals for six days. All control animals showed signs of respiratory disease. Animals treated before infection fared well: no signs of respiratory disease, significantly lower levels of virus replication in the lungs compared to control animals, and no lung damage. Animals treated after infection fared significantly better than the control animals: disease was less severe than in control animals, their lungs had lower levels of virus than the control animals, and the damage to the lungs was less severe.The scientists indicate that the promising study results support additional clinical trials of remdesivir for MERS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. At least two clinical trials of remdesivir for 2019-nCoV are under way in China, and other patients with 2019-nCoV infection have received the drug under a compassionate use protocol.The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, also provided support for this study. Gilead Sciences, Inc., developed remdesivir, also known as GS-5734, and collaborated in the research.MERS-CoV emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Through December 2019, the World Health Organization had confirmed 2,499 MERS-CoV cases and 861 deaths (or about 1 in 3). Because about one-third of MERS-CoV cases spread from infected people being treated in healthcare settings, the scientists suggest that remdesivir could effectively prevent disease in other patients, contacts of patients, and healthcare workers. They also note the drug might help patients who are diagnosed with MERS or 2019-nCoV if given soon after symptoms start.Your email address will not be published.

Despite the high mortality rate, there is currently no single effective drug available to fight these microbes. Now, however, researchers have designed some new compounds that show promise in the laboratory as treatments, according to a report in\u00a0ACS Chemical Neuroscience.Naegleria fowleri\u00a0and\u00a0Balamuthia mandrillaris\u00a0are two types of amoebae that can cause primary amoebic meningoencephalitis and granulomatous amoebic encephalitis. They are single-celled microorganisms that live in water and soil, and can enter the body through the nose or open wounds. These pathogens can then move to the central nervous system, where they destroy brain cells. In the very few cases that have been treated successfully, patients were given high doses of many different antimicrobials. However, these drugs generally lack specificity and can have toxic effects at high levels. To make progress toward a single drug, Ruqaiyyah Siddiqui and colleagues turned to quinazolinones. These compounds are effective against a wide spectrum of human foes, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites and cancer, but they had never been tested against brain-eating amoebae.The researchers synthesized 34 new quinazolinone derivatives and studied their effects on\u00a0N. fowleri\u00a0and\u00a0B. mandrillaris. Some of the new compounds were effective at killing the microorganisms and limiting the harm the pathogens could do to human cells in a Petri dish. In some cases, attaching silver nanoparticles to the derivatives enhanced that activity. The most effective compounds contained chlorine, methyl or methoxy groups, and their toxicity for human cells was low. The researchers say their results show that quinazolinones are good candidates for drug development studies.Naegleria fowleri, Acanthamoeba species and Balamuthia mandrillaris: Uncommon, accidental, yet high consequenceBalamuthia, neti pots and a unique case reportBalamuthia mandrillaris: Koral Reef\u2019s storyYour email address will not be published.

Yet, since the first vaccine developed by Louis Pasteur more than 130 years ago, prophylactic measures have significantly improved. They are now composed of the vaccine allied to purified human or equine rabies immunoglobulins. However, these immunoglobulins are expensive and not easy to reach in developing settings.Researchers from the Structural Virology Unit at the Institut Pasteur, in collaboration with the Virus and Immunity Unit and the Lyssavirus Epidemiology and Neuropathology Unit, have visualized one of the most potent and most broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibody in interaction with the rabies glycoprotein. This finding makes it possible to propose new avenues, both prophylactic and therapeutic, in the fight against rabies.Rabies is a lethal encephalitis due to a lyssavirus mainly transmitted to humans by the bite or scratches of terrestrial carnivores (principally domestic dogs). The onset of clinical symptoms and death can be 100% prevented by adequate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) including vaccines and passive immunization using rabies immunoglobulins. Today, 15 to 29 million of patients exposed to rabies received the PEP each year whose terms have been updated by WHO in 2018 as a result of Institut Pasteur expertise.\u201cIf prevention measures therefore exist today to fight rabies, supply and demand are incoherent in developing countries. The proposed treatments are not produced or not available on site\u201d explains F\u00e9lix Rey, head of the Structural Virology Unit at the Institut Pasteur.Read more at Institut PasteurYour email address will not be published.

            "content": "Patients who underwent a stem cell transplant and received the Triplex vaccine to prevent a type of herpes virus \u2013 cytomegalovirus (CMV) \u2013 from duplicating out of control were 50% less likely to develop health complications related to the virus than patients who did not take Triplex, according to a City of Hope-led study published today in\u00a0Annals of Internal Medicine.The phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, which took place at\u00a0City of Hope, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and MD Anderson Cancer Center, is the first time a viral anti-CMV vaccine has been tested in patients. The trial enrolled 102 people who underwent an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), which can cure blood cancers such as lymphoma and leukemia. Half of the patients were randomly assigned to receive Triplex, developed by City of Hope scientists to enhance CMV-specific T cells, create immunity in patients against CMV and prevent it from causing such severe complications as pneumonia, gastroenteritis and retinitis.In the trial, patients who received at least the first of two planned injections of Triplex on day 28 and day 56 after HSCT had 50% fewer CMV complications (virus reactivation, antiviral treatment and disease) through day 100 (primary endpoint) than those who received the placebo. There were five subjects with CMV complications in the vaccine arm versus 10 in the placebo arm.In addition, patients who received Triplex developed immunity against CMV that was 212% higher than those in the placebo group. Prior to undergoing a transplant, patients received high-dose chemotherapy to obliterate the hematopoietic system, which produces blood and is part of the immune system. Despite having weakened immune systems, patients who received Triplex developed immunity against CMV, and the immunity endured a year after the trial took place.\u201cIt is unprecedented that we can measure the response to the vaccine so early after the transplant procedure,\u201d said\u00a0Don J. Diamond, Ph.D., City of Hope professor in the\u00a0Department of Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation\u00a0and the study\u2019s senior author. \u201cThat is significant because we believe that immunity is the key to controlling CMV\u2019s negative effects.\u201dFurthermore, the number of patients who developed serious health problems in both groups was low. No Triplex-related infections or deaths occurred in the study.\u201cOur study represents hope for transplant patients who already have weakened immune systems and can develop serious, life-threatening CMV-related complications,\u201d Diamond said. \u201cTriplex spurs immunity in patients and prevents CMV-related complications from occurring in stem cell patients. Our vaccine has the potential to become yet another powerful therapy for transplant recipients who are fighting for a cure.\u201dTriplex could also eventually be used in patients who receive solid organ transplants.One finding that needs further examination is patients who received high-dose steroids to prevent graft- versus-host disease (GVHD) did not have as strong of a response to the vaccine as patients who did not take steroids.\u201cSteroids are the standard treatment for GVHD but we are looking at other ways to overcome or avoid steroids,\u201d Diamond added.One trial underway at City of Hope vaccinates the patient\u2019s donor with Triplex. That could provide the patient with earlier and greater immunity against CMV, which is particularly important for patients undergoing high-risk transplants in which they have a haploidentical donor (a half-matched bone marrow donor.)Ryotaro Nakamura, M.D., director of City of Hope\u2019s\u00a0Center for Stem Cell Transplantation, served as the overall principal investigator of the trial, and\u00a0Ibrahim Aldoss, M.D., assistant clinical professor in the Department of Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, was City of Hope\u2019s site principal investigator.Over half of adults by the age of 40 have been infected with CMV, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While symptoms of the virus do not show up in healthy individuals because the immune system is able to fight off CMV infection, it can cause severe, life-threatening disease in those with weakened immune systems such as transplant patients.Triplex is a best-in-class, universal recombinant viral vector vaccine that can be given without restrictions to all eligible transplant recipients and/or their donors, scientifically called modified vaccinia Ankara, engineered to induce a robust and durable virus-specific T cell response to three immuno-dominant proteins linked to CMV complications in stem cell transplant recipients.###Your email address will not be published.

AUDENZ is designed to be rapidly deployed to help protect the U.S. population\u00a0and can be stockpiled for first responders in the event of pandemic.\u201cThe approval of AUDENZ represents a key advance in influenza prevention and pandemic preparedness, combining leading-edge cell-based manufacturing and adjuvant technologies,\u201d said\u00a0Russell Basser, MD, Chief Scientist and Senior Vice President of Research and Development at Seqirus. \u201cThis pandemic influenza vaccine exemplifies our commitment to developing innovative technologies that can help provide rapid response during a pandemic emergency.\u201dAn influenza pandemic is a global epidemic caused by the emergence of a new influenza virus to which there is little or no pre-existing immunity in the human population. Pandemics are impossible to predict and can cause catastrophic morbidity and mortality globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Strategy for 2019-2030 states that a severe pandemic can result in widespread social and economic effects, including a loss of national economic productivity and severe economic burdens on affected citizens and communities.Influenza vaccines using the MF59\u00ae adjuvant may enhance and broaden the body\u2019s immune response by inducing antibodies against virus strains that have mutated. This adjuvant is an important part of pandemic preparedness planning as it reduces the amount of antigen required to produce an immune response, increasing the number of doses of vaccine developed, so that a large number of people can be protected as quickly as possible.\u00a0The cell-based vaccine antigen, MF59\u00ae\u00a0adjuvant, and formulated prefilled syringes used in the AUDENZ vaccine are all produced in the state-of-the-art Seqirus production facility in\u00a0Holly Springs, N.C., built and supported through a multi-year public-private partnership between Seqirus and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.Subscribe to Outbreak News TV on YouTube\u201cPandemic influenza viruses can be deadly and spread rapidly, making production of safe, effective vaccines essential in saving lives,\u201d said BARDA Director\u00a0Rick Bright, Ph.D. \u201cWith this licensure \u2013 the latest FDA-approved vaccine to prevent H5N1 influenza \u2013 we celebrate a decade-long partnership to achieve health security goals set by the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza and the 2019 Executive Order to speed the availability of influenza vaccine. Ultimately, this latest licensure means we can protect more people in an influenza pandemic.\u201dSeqirus is uniquely positioned to manufacture cell-based vaccines on a pandemic scale as a result of its public-private partnership with the BARDA.Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "A recent study published in the\u00a0New England Journal of Medicine shows that infant vaccination against group B meningococcal disease (MenB) has resulted in a significant decline in cases of the disease in young children since the program was introduced in the United Kingdom.In September 2015, the UK became the first country to offer a new vaccine (Bexsero) against\u00a0MenB\u00a0to babies at 8 and 16 weeks of age, followed by a booster around their first birthday. Infants in the first year of life have the highest incidence of\u00a0MenB\u00a0disease so vaccinating at these times helps protect them when they are most at risk.Public Health England\u2019s (PHE) study shows that by the third year of the program, cases of MenB disease were 62% lower in children who were eligible for at least 2 doses of the vaccine. Between 2015 and 2018, an estimated 277 out of an expected 446 cases were prevented because of the program.Dr Shamez Ladhani, Consultant Epidemiologist at Public Health England, said:England has one of the most comprehensive immunization programs in the world. The implementation of the MenB\u00a0vaccine in 2015 is a great success, it is already saving lives and means fewer parents and young children will experience this devastating illness.It is vital that children receive all available vaccines on time to provide the best protection at the age when they are at highest risk.\u00a0PHE\u00a0is working closely with NHS England to make it as easy as possible for parents to access vaccines so that they can offer their children the best possible start in life.MenB is one of the leading infectious killers in young children. The disease causes meningitis and septicemia (blood poisoning) especially in young children and, while most recover with swift medical treatment, sadly around 1 out of 20 will die of the infection. The disease can be life-changing for survivors who experience long-term complications such as brain injury, epilepsy, hearing loss, and amputation of limbs.Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "An analysis of publicly available data on infections from the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that causes the respiratory illness COVID-19 yielded an estimate of 5.1 days for the median disease incubation period, according to a new study led by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. This median time from exposure to onset of symptoms suggests that the 14-day quarantine period used by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for individuals with likely exposure to the coronavirus is reasonable.The analysis suggests that about 97.5 percent of people who develop symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection will do so within 11.5 days of exposure. The researchers estimated that for every 10,000 individuals quarantined for 14 days, only about 101 would develop symptoms after being released from quarantine.The findings will be published online March 9 in the journal\u00a0Annals of Internal Medicine.For the study, the researchers analyzed 181 cases from China and other countries that were detected prior to February 24, were reported in the media, and included likely dates of exposure and symptom onset. Most of the cases involved travel to or from Wuhan, China, the city at the center of the epidemic, or exposure to individuals who had been to Hubei, the province for which Wuhan is the capital.The CDC and many other public health authorities around the world have been using a 14-day quarantine or active-monitoring period for individuals who are known to be at high risk of infection due to contact with known cases or travel to a heavily affected area.\u201cBased on our analysis of publicly available data, the current recommendation of 14 days for active monitoring or quarantine is reasonable, although with that period some cases would be missed over the long-term,\u201d says study senior author Justin Lessler, an associate professor in the Bloomberg School\u2019s Department of Epidemiology.Outbreak News Interviews PodcastThe global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China, and has resulted in 95,333 officially confirmed cases around the world and 3,282 deaths from pneumonia caused by the virus, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s March 5 Situation Report. The majority of the cases are from Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, although dozens of other countries have been affected, including the U.S., but chiefly South Korea, Iran, and Italy.An accurate estimate of the disease incubation period for a new virus makes it easier for epidemiologists to gauge the likely dynamics of the outbreak, and allows public health officials to design effective quarantine and other control measures. Quarantines typically slow and may ultimately stop the spread of infection, even if there are some outlier cases with incubation periods that exceed the quarantine period.Lessler notes that sequestering people in a way that prevents them from working has costs, both personal and societal, which is perhaps most obvious when health care workers and first responders like firefighters are quarantined.Got Smallpox?The new estimate of 5.1 days for the median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to estimates from the earliest studies of this new virus, which were based on fewer cases. This incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is in the same range as SARS-CoV, a different human-infecting coronavirus that caused a major outbreak centered in southern China and Hong Kong from 2002-04. For MERS-CoV, a coronavirus that has caused hundreds of cases in the Middle East, with a relatively high fatality rate, the estimated mean incubation period is 5-7 days.Human coronaviruses that cause common colds have mean illness-incubation periods of about three days.Lessler and colleagues have published an online tool that allows public health officials and members of the public to estimate how many cases would be caught and missed under different quarantine periods.Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "By NewsDesk\u00a0\u00a0@infectiousdiseasenewsBeing of an older age, showing signs of sepsis, and having blood clotting issues when admitted to hospital are key risk factors associated with higher risk of death from the new coronavirus (COVID-19), according to a new observational study of 191 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from two hospitals in Wuhan, China, published in\u00a0The Lancet.Specifically, being of an older age, having a high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and having d-dimer greater than 1 \u03bcg/L are the factors that could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.The new study is the first time researchers have examined risk factors associated with severe disease and death in hospitalised adults who have either died or been discharged from hospital. In the study of 191 patients, 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. The authors note that interpretation of their findings might be limited by the study\u2019s sample size.In addition, the authors present new data on viral shedding, which indicate that the median duration of viral shedding was 20 days in survivors (ranging from 8 to 37 days), and the virus was detectable until death in the 54 non-survivors.While prolonged viral shedding suggests that patients may still be capable of spreading COVID-19, the authors caution that the duration of viral shedding is influenced by disease severity, and note that all patients in the study were hospitalised, two-thirds of whom had severe or critical illness. Moreover, the estimated duration of viral shedding was limited by the low frequency of respiratory specimen collection and the lack of measurable genetic material detection in samples.\u201cThe extended viral shedding noted in our study has important implications for guiding decisions around isolation precautions and antiviral treatment in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. However, we need to be clear that viral shedding time should not be confused with other self-isolation guidance for people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 but do not have symptoms, as this guidance is based on the incubation time of the virus,\u201d explains co-lead author Professor Bin Cao from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University, China.He continues: \u201cWe recommend that negative tests for COVID-19 should be required before patients are discharged from hospital. In severe influenza, delayed viral treatment extends how long the virus is shed, and together these factors put infected patients at risk of dying. Similarly, effective antiviral treatment may improve outcomes in COVID-19, although we did not observe shortening of viral shedding duration after antiviral treatment in our study.\u201dGot Smallpox?According to co-author Dr Zhibo Liu from Jinyintan Hospital, China: \u201cOlder age, showing signs of sepsis on admission, underlying diseases like high blood pressure and diabetes, and the prolonged use of non-invasive ventilation were important factors in the deaths of these patients. Poorer outcomes in older people may be due, in part, to the age-related weakening of the immune system and increased inflammation that could promote viral replication and more prolonged responses to inflammation, causing lasting damage to the heart, brain, and other organs.\u201dFor the first time, the study describes the complete picture of the progression of the COVID-19. The median duration of fever was about 12 days in survivors, which was similar in non-survivors. But the cough may last for a long time\u201345% of survivors still had cough on discharge. In survivors, dyspnoea (shortness of breath) would cease after about 13 days, but would last until death in non-survivors. The study also illustrates the time of the occurrence of different complications such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury and the secondary infection.The new analysis includes all adults (aged 18 or older) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital after December 29, 2019, who had been discharged or died by January 31, 2020. These were the two designated hospitals for transferring patients with severe COVID-19 from across Wuhan up until February 1, 2020.During the study, the researchers compared clinical records, treatment data, laboratory results, and demographic data between survivors who had been discharged from hospital and non-survivors. They looked at the clinical course of symptoms, viral shedding, and changes in laboratory findings during hospitalisation (eg, blood examinations, chest x-rays, and CT scans; see table 1 for full list), and used mathematical modelling to examine risk factors associated with dying in hospital.On average, patients were middle-aged (median age 56 years), most were men (62%, 119 patients), and around half had underlying chronic conditions (48%, 91 patients)\u2013the most common being high blood pressure (30%, 58 patients) and diabetes (19%, 36 patients). From illness onset, the median time to discharge was 22 days, and the average time to death was 18.5 days.Outbreak News Interviews PodcastCompared with survivors, patients who died were more likely to be older (average age 69 years vs 52 years), and have a higher score on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) indicating sepsis, and elevated blood levels of the d-dimer protein (a marker for coagulation) on admission to hospital.Additionally, lower lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell) count, elevated levels of Interleukin 6 (IL-6, a biomarker for inflammation and chronic disease), and increased high-sensitivity troponin I concentrations (a marker of heart attack), were more common in severe COVID-19 illness.The frequency of complications such as respiratory failure (98%, 53/54 non-survivors vs 36%, 50/137 survivors), sepsis (100%, 54/54 vs 42%, 58/137), and secondary infections (50%, 27/54 vs 1%, 1/137) were also higher in those who died than survivors.The authors note several limitations of the study, including that due to excluding patients still in hospital as of Jan 31, 2020, and thus relatively more severe disease at an earlier stage, the number of deaths does not reflect the true mortality of COVID-19. They also point out that not all laboratory tests (eg, d-dimer test) were done in all patients, so their exact role in predicting in-hospital death might be underestimated. Finally, a lack of effective antivirals, inadequate adherence to standard supportive therapy, and high doses of corticosteroids, as well as the transfer of some patients to hospital late in their illness, might have also contributed to the poor outcomes in some patients.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"c7d6bad8d6f876880d92a91faeeb2259\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B006IVBSBU,B07JP22QZX,0815731353,B01I679TPU\";Your email address will not be published.

The real number, according to the agency, is closer to 300,000.Underreporting affects the ability of public health authorities to assess risk, allocate resources and devise prevention strategies. It also makes early detection very difficult, hampering efforts to treat the condition quickly and effectively.A new report, published on March 3, 2020, in Journal of the American Medical Association, describes a data model developed by researchers from Columbia University and RTI International, a nonprofit research institute, that helps identify areas of the United States where Lyme disease cases may go unreported.\u201cWe believe our analysis can help predict the trajectory of where Lyme disease will spread,\u201d said Maria Pilar Fernandez, a post-doctoral researcher at Columbia and lead author of the study. \u201cIdentifying high-risk areas can lead to surveillance in counties and areas where infections are likely to emerge. It also allows authorities to alert physicians and the public, which can lead to early treatment, when it is most effective.\u201dTo develop their model, the researchers analyzed publicly available data, tracking the geographic spread of Lyme disease over nearly two decades.

            "content": "Health systems can protect healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak when best practices for infection control are diligently applied along with lessons learned from recent outbreaks, according to a study published today in\u00a0Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology, the journal of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.Researchers from Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong reported that zero healthcare workers contracted COVID-19 and no hospital-acquired infections were identified after the first six weeks of the outbreak, even as the health system tested 1,275 suspected cases and treated 42 active confirmed cases of COVID-19. Eleven healthcare workers, out of 413 involved in treating confirmed cases, had unprotected exposure and were quarantined for 14 days. None became ill.\u201cAppropriate hospital infection control measures can prevent healthcare-associated transmission of the coronavirus,\u201d study authors said. \u201cVigilance in hand-hygiene practice, wearing of surgical masks in the hospital, and appropriate use of personal protective equipment in patient care, especially when performing aerosol-generating procedures, are the key infection control measures to prevent hospital transmission of the virus.\u201dThe researchers also conducted an experiment taking air samples from close to the mouth of a patient with a moderate level of viral load of coronavirus. The virus was not detected in any of the tests, whether the patient was breathing normally, breathing heavily, speaking or coughing, and tests of the objects around the room detected the virus in just one location, on a window bench.\u201cThe descriptive study employed unique environmental and air samples with the results suggesting that environmental transmission may play less of a role than person to person transmission in disease propagation,\u201d said Gonzalo Bearman, MD, professor of medicine and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease at Virginia Commonwealth University, who reviewed but was not involved in the study.When the first reports of a cluster of pneumonia cases came from Wuhan, Hong Kong\u2019s 43 public hospitals stepped up infection control measures by widening screening criteria to include factors like visits to hospitals in mainland China. When the screening process identified a patient infected with the coronavirus, the patient was immediately isolated in an airborne infection isolation room or, in a few cases, in a ward with at least a meter of space between patients.Enhanced infection control measures were put in place in each hospital, including training on the use of personal protective equipment, staff forums on infection control, face-to-face education sessions, and regular hand-hygiene compliance assessments. Hospitals also increased the use of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers performing aerosol generating procedures like endotracheal intubation or open suctioning for all patients, not just those with or at risk for COVID-19.During the first six weeks of the outbreak, the number of locally acquired cases of COVID-19 in Hong Kong increased from 1 of 13 cases confirmed in the first 32 days of surveillance to 27 of 29 cases confirmed from day 33 to 42. Of the locally acquired cases, 28 came from eight family clusters with 11 cases likely transmitted during a gathering for \u201chot pot,\u201d where utensils contaminated with saliva were comingled in shared pots. This family included a 91-year-old woman and a child who both tested positive for the virus but did not display symptoms.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"6114f61b3e1f8cc2a827d802b14811c0\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1491283068,B085DDJ7XV,B00939IORU,B01M4GBIWB\";Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "Integrating travel history information into routine medical assessments could help stem the rapidly widening COVID-19 epidemic, as well as future pandemics, infectious disease specialists recommend in the Annals of Internal Medicine.Trish Perl, M.D., M.Sc., Chief of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center, and Connie Savor Price, M.D., of the University of Colorado School of Medicine, say it\u2019s time to add travel history to routine information such as temperature and blood pressure collected in electronic medical records.\u201cWe have the infrastructure to do this easily with the electronic medical record, we just need to implement it in a way to make it useful to the care teams,\u201d says Perl, who studies outbreaks and pandemics. \u201cOnce the infrastructure is built, we\u2019ll also need to communicate what is called \u2018situational awareness\u2019 to ensure that providers know what geographic areas have infections so that they can act accordingly.\u201dA simple, targeted travel history can help put infectious symptoms in context for physicians and caregiver teams, and, if deemed appropriate, trigger more detailed history, further testing, and rapid implementation of protective measures for others in affected households, co-workers or other daily contacts, and health care personnel. Shared electronic health records also can integrate travel history with computerized decision-making support to suggest specific diagnoses in recent travelers, the authors note, in much the same way as trained medical teams routinely ask about tobacco exposure to ascertain levels of cancer and heart disease risk.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"01bf59939b7cf7b1c4b25f2c40de6e2f\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B005AIIPLS,B07LFX17TM\";The emergence of novel respiratory diseases in the past two decades \u2013 including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012-2013, Western Africa-based Ebola in 2014, and now COVID-19 from China \u2013 demonstrate the need for change. With each wave, \u201cthe urgent threat of communicable diseases comes with significant morbidity and mortality, tremendous health care disruptions and resource utilization, and collateral economic and societal costs,\u201d Perl and Price write.\u201cMERS and SARS were associated with very specific travel. MERS was associated with travel to the Arabian Peninsula, and SARS was associated with travel primarily to Hong Kong, Singapore, and Beijing,\u201d Perl says. \u201cCurrently COVID is similar in that there are geographic clusters, but those lines may be blurring as the outbreak expands. The challenges and potential stress on the public health infrastructure, including the hospitals which are part of this, will be notable in that we could see large numbers of patients. Our role will not only be to care for these patients but to communicate to them the strategies that they can use to protect themselves.\u201dThe Annals commentary suggests that a simple script could be strategically and carefully developed to elicit clues for emerging infectious diseases and information about current emerging pathogen threats. The information could be collected along with the four gold standard vital signs \u2013 temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure \u2013 currently used to help U.S.-based medical teams assess patients\u2019 health status, triage to appropriate care, determine potential diagnoses, and predict recovery.\u201cThe current outbreak is an opportune time to consider adding travel history to the routine. The COVID outbreak is clearly moving at a tremendous pace, with new clusters appearing daily,\u201d says Perl, who holds the Jay P. Sanford Professorship in Infectious Diseases at UTSW. \u201cThis pace is a signal to us that it is a matter of time before we will see more of these infections in the U.S. What is different with this outbreak is that this virus is more fit and transmissible and hence there has been much more transmission.\u201dYour email address will not be published.

Only five patients showed disease associated with a family outbreak.While the emergency group patients were older than the patients in the nonemergency group, the rate of underlying disease was not significantly different in the two groups\u2013suggesting that viral load could be a better reflection of the severity and extent of COVID-19 pneumonia.Hand Soaps & Sanitizers at Dollar Tree!As Zhao and Zhong explained further: \u201cArchitectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and pleural effusions, which may reflect the viral load and virulence of COVID-19, were statistically different between the two groups and may help us to identify the emergency type disease.\u201dThe authors of this AJR article also noted that CT involvement score can help evaluate the severity and extent of COVID-19 pneumonia.Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "By Robert Herriman\u00a0 @infectiousdiseasenewsNot only was Dec. 31, 2019 the end of the year, but it was also the end of the 2010s decade (Jan. 1, 2010-Dec. 31, 2019).In this post, I list what I believe to be the top infectious disease news stories of the past decade.9. First Naegleria fowleri survivors in the United States in 35 yearsPrimary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a nearly always lethal infection of the central nervous system.Of the 145+ infections reported in the United States since 1962, only four have survived.Prior to 2013, the last survivor was in 1978 (35 years earlier). In 2013, two patients survived the 98 percent fatal amoebic infection. The first one was 12-year-old Kali Hardig from Arkansas who made a full neurologic recovery and returned to school. Her recovery has been attributed to early diagnosis and treatment and novel therapeutics including miltefosine and hypothermia.Naegleria: Fort Worth hospital 1st to house miltefosine in 2016, today it\u2019s 21 hospitals8. Cholera in HaitiA magnitude-7.0 earthquake that struck Haiti on the afternoon of January 12, 2010, which killed and injured 100s of thousands of people.Ten months after the catastrophic earthquake, a cholera outbreak was confirmed in Haiti. V. cholerae serogroup O1, biotype Ogawa was identified as the strain.604,634 cases of infection, 329,697 hospitalizations, and 7436 deaths from cholera were reported in the first two years.To date, nine years later, some 800,000 cases and nearly 10,000 deaths have been reported over the course of the decade since the outbreak started.Fortunately, the numbers of cases reported in 2019 were few; however, as UN Special Envoy Josette Sheeran wrote in November 2019, \u201cAlthough Haiti is in the \u201chomestretch\u201d of defeating a cholera outbreak first declared nine years ago, the battle is far from over before the country is free of the deadly disease.\u201d7. India is polio freeOn January 13, 2011, a 2-year-old girl in the West Bengal state fell ill of the crippling disease polio. That was the last case of polio in India.This was a milestone many thought they many see as India, as early as 1985, saw 150,000 polio cases that year. In fact, as recent as 2009, India had half of the reported cases of polio worldwide.Thanks to the mobilization of millions across the country and the billions of dollars invested for a mass eradication program set out to give every child under five the oral\u00a0polio vaccine, India did achieve polio-free certification in 2014.6. H7N9 avian influenza in ChinaIn March 2013, China reported the first human case of H7N9 avian influenza. The virus has seen 5 waves, or epidemics since that time resulting in more than 1,500 human cases, with approximate 40 percent resulting in death.31 imported cases from China were reported in five countries, primarily in Hong Kong.According to WHO\u2019s assistant director-general for health, security and the environment, Keiji Fukuda, who said in 2013, \u201d This is definitely one of the most lethal influenza viruses we have seen so far.\u201d5. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since affected people in 27 countries\u201310 on the Arabian Peninsula and 17 (travel-associated) outside the Arabian Peninsula.Since the first cases were reported in 2012 through November 2019, a total of 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV and 858 associated deaths were reported globally, mostly in Saudi Arabia.Subscribe to Outbreak News TV on YouTube4. 2009-2010 H1N1 PandemicWhile this influenza pandemic began during the last decade (the spring of 2009), it did stretch into 2010 and the numbers were huge.In the US alone, from April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases, 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths.Additionally, CDC estimated that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated.What was unusual about this pandemic, 80 percent of (H1N1)pdm09 virus-related deaths globally were estimated to have occurred in people younger than 65 years of age.3. Zika virus epidemic in the AmericasIn May 2015, the public health authorities of Brazil confirmed autochthonous transmission of Zika virus in the northeastern part of the country.Incidence of Zika virus infection in the Americas peaked in 2016 and declined substantially throughout 2017 and 2018.Zika virus transmission has been found in all countries in the Region of the Americas except mainland Chile, Uruguay, and Canada.While Zika virus infection is typically mild, it was soon discovered that complications could be quite serious.Zika history: A timeline to a public health crisisZika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities in the developing fetus and newborn. Zika infection in pregnancy also results in pregnancy complications such as fetal loss, stillbirth, and preterm birth.Zika virus infection is also a trigger of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, neuropathy and myelitis, particularly in adults and older children.Research continues on Zika virus infection.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"1f9ce5681864f82758f9c92ed2071dbf\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B01MYEHMKU,B003QTD4T6,0393353966,0143036491\";2. Yemen cholera outbreakThe cholera epidemic in\u00a0Yemen became the largest and fastest-spreading outbreak of the disease in modern history during the past decade.The outbreak surpassed Haiti as the biggest since modern records began in 1949.The cumulative number of suspected cholera cases reported in Yemen since October 2016 to November 2019 is 2,236,570 including 3886 related deaths, with a case fatality rate of 0.17%.The country experienced a second wave of this outbreak from 27 April 2017. The total number of\nsuspected cholera cases reported during the second wave were 2,210,743 including 3757 related deaths with a case fatality rate of 0.17%Years of fighting between the Saudi-led coalition and Houthi rebels crippled the country, causing widespread internal displacement,\u00a0 and the collapse of the public health and sanitation system, where 2/3s of the population did not have access to clean water and sanitation led to this massive outbreak.1.West Africa Ebola OutbreakIn early 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported cases of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the forested rural region of southeastern Guinea.Crowded urban areas, increased mobilization across borders, and conflicts between key infection control practices and prevailing cultural and traditional practices saw EVD spread to the bordering countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and beyond, eventually seven other countries\u2013Italy, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in Aug. 2014.Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea were finally declared Ebola-free in June 2016, not after a record 28,600 cases and 11,325 deaths were reported making this outbreak by far the largest ever.Honorable mention2013-2014 Chikungunya outbreak in the Americas2017 Madagascar plague outbreak2019 Global measles outbreak2018-2019 Ebola outbreak in DRCYour email address will not be published.

            "content": "By Robert Herriman\u00a0\u00a0@bactiman63As 2019 comes to a close, the number of big, important infectious disease news and outbreak was in no shortage since January.So, it becomes my annual task to try to take it all, sort it out, and create a Top 10 list. This is what I came up with this year:10. Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) in the USAfter reporting an average of seven human EEE cases annually in the United States over the past decade, 2019 saw a particularly robust and deadly year.This year, there were 38 confirmed cases of human EEE disease, including 15 deaths. While 10 states reported human cases, Massachusetts (12) and Michigan (10) were hit hardest.What to expect in 2020? Time will tell.9. Global malariaWhile we don\u2019t have the complete picture for malaria globally in 2019, in December, the World Health Organization released the World malaria report 2019.What we find in the report is some great news for South Asia. Six countries across the Mekong River basin \u2014 Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam\u2013saw malaria cases drop by 76 percent and malaria-related deaths fell by 95 percent.However, African countries did report an increase of 1 million cases from 2017 to 2018, and the continent accounted for almost 94 percent of global cases and deaths from the disease in 2018.8. Lassa feverLassa fever remains a major public health challenge in West Africa with Nigeria bearing the highest burden.Through the first 11 months of the year, Nigeria reported some 800 confirmed cases and 166 deaths for a CFR of greater than 20 percent.In addition to Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone have reported outbreaks of the viral disease, albeit much smaller. Imported Lassa fever was also reported in a resident of the Netherlands that was working in Sierra Leone.Subscribe to Outbreak News TV on YouTube7. VaccinesVaccines in the news were often in 2019\u2013for both good and bad reasons. The antivaxxer movement has shown the public health problems they caused in such diverse areas of the globe as New York City and Samoa.On the positive side, vaccine research has brought us an Ebola vaccine, and promising work on vaccines for a universal flu vaccine, Lassa fever, EEE and chikungunya vaccines, to name a few.6. African Swine fever in AsiaWhile African swine fever (ASF) was first reported in Asia in China in Aug. 2018, 2019 saw the expansion of the animal disease on the continent.Vietnam, the Philippines, South and North Korea, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Timor-Leste and most recently, Indonesia, reported outbreaks in 2019 resulting in millions of pigs getting culled.5. Hepatitis A in the United StatesThe first hepatitis A outbreaks began in 2016 with 2 states and have grown to 30 states and some 30,000 cases in 2019.Thousands of cases were reported again this year. While Kentucky has seen a cumulative 5,000 cases since 2017, the numbers have slowed in 2019.However, in Florida, more than 3,300 hepatitis A outbreak cases have been reported.4. The polio resurgenceIn what is arguably the most disappointing infectious disease story of 2019, polio has seen an unfortunate resurgence this year.In 2018, 33 total wild poliovirus 1 (WPV1) were reported (only 12 in Pakistan). Official data from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative shows 125 total cases year-to-date, with over 100 in Pakistan.Media reports put the Pakistan case count even higher at 119.In addition to the WPV cases reported, the number of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus has risen significantly this year\u2013241 cases this year ( in 16 African and Asian countries) compared to 104 in 2018.The twenty-third meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the Director General earlier this month and it was noted they were \u201cgravely concerned\u201d by the significant increase in WPV1 cases globally and said the rapid emergence of multiple cVDPV2 strains in several countries is unprecedented and very concerning, and not yet fully understood.There was some great news concerning polio in 2019\u2013over the summer, \u00a0the three year anniversary of no WPV1 cases reported in Nigeria occurred.In addition, wild poliovirus type 3 was declared eradicated in 2019.Got Smallpox? merchandise3. Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)Last year\u2019s number one story comes in at number 3 in 2019. The 10th Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in the DRC was declared in August 2018 and the outbreak continues on through the end of 2019.To date, 3,373 confirmed and probable cases have been reported (the 2nd largest EVD outbreak in history), including 2,231 deaths.M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res\u00a0(MSF) said this week\u2013While there are positive signs that the number of cases is slowly reducing, the outbreak remains a serious public health concern, and it is unclear when it may end.We also got a serious scare over the summer when Uganda announced that three people had been positively diagnosed with Ebola, the first cross-border cases since the outbreak began.

Global Dengue feverThe numbers are staggering in many parts of the world\u20133 million dengue cases in Latin America in 2019, a new record, with Brazil reporting more than 2 million cases alone.The Philippines has reported more than 400,000 cases, almost double the cases reported in 2018.Bangladesh saw more than 100,000 cases in 2019, many more cases than were reported in the country from 2000-2018.That\u2019s just a short list.1. Global measlesAgain, I could just list the numbers:~300,000 and more than 5,000 deaths in the DRC, ~250,000 in Madagascar (since September 2018), ~60,000 in Ukraine, ~55,000 in Nigeria and ~45,000 in the Philippines\u2013 and again, this is just the short list.In the United States, nearly 1,300 measles cases were reported in 2019, the greatest number of cases reported since 1992.While the global totals for measles in 2019 will not be released for some time; however, with more than 140,000 measles-related fatalities seen in 2018, I could only imagine what will be reported.Well, there you have it\u2013this is the list I\u2019ve complied after following infectious diseases and outbreaks closely over the course of the year.Check out some previous \u201cend-of-year\u201d lists I published:10 Most Important Infectious Disease Stories of 2018: Outbreak News Today10 Most Important Infectious Disease Stories of 2017: Outbreak News TodayThe Top 10 Infectious Disease News stories of 2014 on Outbreak News TodayThe Top 10 Infectious Disease and Outbreak News stories of 2013Related:The Top 10 Biggest Vaccine Stories Of 2016Top 10 Deadliest Virusesamzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"8a92eca044cb93873fd1394d5a593b07\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"0465057969,0195307143,1640121420,1589881222,0393346617,1421426609,0316418080,1097510573\";Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "During a press briefing at United Nations Information Service in Geneva, the following was commemorated:Dr. Rosamund Lewis, Head of the Smallpox Secretariat at the\u00a0World Health Organization\u00a0(WHO), said that 9 December had marked the fortieth anniversary of the signing of the certificate of the eradication of smallpox. The certificate had been signed by the Global Commission for the Certification of Smallpox Eradication, which had been made up of 19 members led by Australia.Smallpox was a terrible disease that had killed 30 per cent of the people who contracted it and had caused 300 million deaths between 1900 and 1978. The first efforts to combat it had begun in 1721, when small doses of the variola virus had been placed on the arms of children who had then passed it to other children during long sea voyages. In 1796, the physician Edward Jenner had discovered that young milkmaids who caught cowpox never developed smallpox. He had then produced the first vaccine for smallpox and predicted that the disease would be eradicated.In 1958, at the eleventh World Health Assembly, the Soviet delegation had presented a resolution proposing to eliminate smallpox. In 1967, WHO had intensified its efforts through the global eradication programme. The last naturally occurring case of the disease had been detected in Somalia in 1977. Five months after the signing of the certificate of eradication in December 1979, at the thirty-third World Health Assembly the WHO member States had declared the disease eradicated.Got Smallpox? merchandiseThe variola virus was nowadays kept in two repositories in the Russian Federation and the United States of America. At those facilities, research was ongoing to develop countermeasures and vaccines should the world ever experience a resurgence of the disease.Some of the lessons learned from the eradication of smallpox continued to be applied today. For example, house-to-house active case search surveillance underpinned the polio eradication programme, while the use of ring vaccination of contacts was used to combat the spread of Ebola.In 1980, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and WHO had launched the concept of universal childhood immunization. The eradication of smallpox remained an incredible achievement that showed what the world could do when all nations worked together.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"98700c784920ede2d99664e0977223de\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1591027225,0226351688\";Responding to questions from journalists, Dr. Lewis said that smallpox was not known to have been successfully weaponized. Those countries that had attempted to weaponize it continued to be monitored under the Biological Weapons Convention. The role of WHO was to monitor the two repositories where the virus was stored and inspect them every two years. The facility in the Russian Federation had last been inspected in January 2019 and the one in the United States in May 2019.Asked which other diseases were close to being eradicated, Dr. Lewis said that polio and guinea worm were on the brink of being eradicated. So far, no human disease other than smallpox had been eradicated. However, rinderpest, which affected cattle and had decimated livestock in many communities around the world, had recently been eradicated.Your email address will not be published.

A Measles Taskforce has been convened by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services to coordinate the response to the outbreak and assist the respective divisional and subdivisional teams.Since the last update on 7th November there has been zero new cases \u2013 one of the suspected cases from the 7th November update was subsequently confirmed to have measles after lab testing.There are three confirmed cases and one suspected case reported from Wailali Settlement in Wainadoi. The three confirmed cases are a four-month-old baby and two adults between the ages of twenty and twenty-five. The four month old baby continues to be admitted in a stable condition, in isolation, at Navua hospital, and the Serua/Namosi Subdivisional Outbreak Response Team are conducting daily monitoring of the two adults, who are recovering well in home quarantine.

            "content": "By Dr. Steven Q. SimpsonSepsis is a public health crisis in the United States and around the world. There is no doubt about it. Each year, an estimated 270,000 people in the U.S. die from sepsis and another 100,000 are discharged from hospital to hospice care. It is the third leading cause of death in the country. By the time you finish reading this piece, another three people will have died of sepsis in this country alone.Approximately 1.4 million additional people in the U.S. actually survive sepsis each year, but returning to their previous way of life can be difficult, sometimes even impossible. Up to half of survivors are left with life-changing long-term physical, cognitive, and/or psychological effects. These lasting effects force many to quit their jobs or school and can have a negative impact on personal relationships. Some face depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Thousands more are no longer able to cope with day to day activities on their own alone and must move into assisted care facilities.Have You Ever Heard of Sepsis?Sepsis is a medical emergency. It is the body\u2019s overwhelming, out of control, and life-threatening response to infection. Sepsis and septic shock can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death. Any infection, from an infected bug bite to pneumonia, can trigger sepsis. Although sepsis strikes certain groups of people with greater frequency, such as the very old, the very young, and those with weakened immune systems, it also happens to in people who are fit and healthy. This includes pregnant or post-partum women, children playing at school, and athletes practicing with their teams.Thanks to awareness campaigns over the past several years, more people in the U.S. than ever before have heard the word sepsis. But the 2019 Sepsis Awareness Survey, an annual survey conducted by Sepsis Alliance, found that over 1/3 of adults in the U.S. still have not heard of sepsis, and many who recognize the word are unable to recognize its most common symptoms. This should be surprising given that just about everyone knows of someone who has had sepsis. If you know somebody who was severely ill and hospitalized from an infection such as pneumonia, the flu, or even a urinary tract infection, you know someone who had sepsis. If you knew someone who died from an infection, you knew someone who had sepsis. In reality, however, it\u2019s not surprising that so few people actually know what sepsis is because doctors and nurses often don\u2019t say the word. Instead, they refer to the illness or death as a \u201ccomplication of [fill-in-the-blank infection]\u201d. If healthcare professionals don\u2019t use the word, the public can\u2019t learn about it, or advocate for their own healthcare or the care of a loved one.Sepsis Compared to Other Medical EmergenciesThese days we face so many serious health issues: heart disease, strokes, cancer, and opioid overdoses to name a few. Strokes take about 140,000 lives in the U.S. each year, half of the number of sepsis deaths. Yet 57% of Americans can tell you about stroke symptoms while only 14% of Americans can describe the symptoms of sepsis, as evidenced by the national survey undertaken on behalf of Sepsis Alliance.Opioid overdoses take about 47,000 lives per year in the U.S., breast cancer about 41,000 lives, and prostate cancer 41,000 lives. This means that sepsis takes more lives in one year than opioid overdoses, breast cancer, and prostate cancer combined. Still, according to the 2019 survey, most people believe that opioid overdose deaths far surpass deaths related to sepsis. Interestingly, more people are aware of Ebola, an infectious disease that rarely affects people in the U.S., than they are of sepsis.Clearly, the number of people who know what sepsis is and what it does to the body is not proportional to the the toll it takes on human life, especially in comparison with the number who know about other serious medical conditions, even ones that rarely affect us in North America.Sepsis Is ExpensiveAside from the lives affected by sepsis, the condition also has a high financial cost to patients and their families, the community at large, insurance companies, and the government. The cost of an average hospital stay for sepsis is about $18,600 \u2013 double that for all other conditions. Overall, treating sepsis patients consumes more than $27 billion per year \u2013 the highest cost compared to any other condition or disease.Sepsis is also the number one cause for hospital readmissions. An estimated one-third of sepsis survivors are re-hospitalized within three months of their initial discharge, at a cost of about $2 billion per year.Rising costs related to sepsis don\u2019t stop after hospital discharge because survivors often must be transferred to a rehabilitation facility as they work on regaining lost function/s, such as their ability to walk. Likewise, for the many survivors who experience long-term effects, such as amputations, chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, and more, direct medical costs continue to rise for medications, treatments, therapies, and specialized equipment. More money is lost if the survivor cannot return to work at all or if caregivers must also take time off work to care for the sepsis survivor.We Can Change the Statistics and Save LivesAs many as 80% of sepsis deaths can be prevented. Although we don\u2019t know why some people develop sepsis and others don\u2019t, we do know that rapid identification and treatment can significantly decrease the mortality rate. And like strokes and heart attacks, sepsis diagnosis and treatment within the first hour \u2013 the golden hour \u2013 could mean the difference between life and death.In 2018, Sepsis Alliance launched a national initiative called Sepsis: It\u2019s About TIME\u2122 to promote sepsis awareness and the need for urgency in seeking treatment when sepsis is suspected. TIME as a memory aid stands for:People are encouraged to contact their healthcare provider, go to the nearest emergency room, or call 911 if they have a combination of two or more of these signs and symptoms and say, \u201cI\u2019m concerned about sepsis.\u201d And be persistent. If the doctor says, \u201cno\u201d, ask why not. You deserve to know what the doctor is thinking.Infection Prevention Reduces Risk of SepsisOne important way to prevent sepsis is by preventing infections. We know that not all infections are preventable, but we can substantially reduce the risk of infection with accepted infection-prevention strategies. These include regular vaccinations, proper food handling, and personal hygiene, and timely identification and treatment of infections, no matter how seemingly insignificant they may be. Antibiotics are life savers, but overuse and improper use has resulted in mutations of bacteria so that some are resistant to antibiotics. Therefore, public education about proper antibiotic use is also vital.Helping Healthcare Providers Improve CareSepsis awareness is increasing, but more still needs to be done. To address this issue, an increasing number of educational opportunities are available to healthcare professionals and others who work close to or with patients over the continuum of care. Maintenance or food service personnel who see the same patient every day may notice that the patient is more confused or out of sorts than usual. A home healthcare aide may notice that her patient has a fever and redness around a wound. A physical therapist may spot a developing sore under a patient\u2019s prosthetic. Everyone has a role to play in sepsis identification and they should communicate any changes in status with the healthcare professionals in a patient\u2019s life to ensure that possible infections are prevented or quickly treated.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"a7f9d932192714d993dc11c90191c7d6\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07K1T2LX6,1493973320\";Sepsis Alliance provides different levels of educational materials for various groups. Tools include basic brochures, videos, and toolkits for the general public, as well as Faces of Sepsis, a place for survivors and those who lost loved ones to sepsis to share their stories. There is also educational information for healthcare providers. All information is downloadable and free of charge.The Sepsis Coordinator Network provides tools and resources geared towards healthcare professionals who are working to improve sepsis care in their facility or organization. Members do not have to be coordinators to join. The Sepsis Coordinator Network provides regular webinars and other materials to help providers learn more about sepsis, its presentation, and the importance of rapid treatment. Access is free and available from anywhere, at any time of day. In addition, the Sepsis Coordinator Network has forums where nurses and other professionals can discuss sepsis issues, allowing for free peer-to-peer exchange of information.The Sepsis Institute, to be launched later this year, will include training modules and webinars for providers across the continuum of care, including primary care practitioners, emergency medical services personnel, nurses, and emergency room physicians. Content on The Sepsis Institute is funded in part with Federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response ASPR), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), Division of Research Innovation and Ventures (DRIVe).Millions of people have been killed or maimed by sepsis, and many live with its long-lasting effects. Despite its devastating human cost, sepsis is still unknown to many. It flies under the radar, often masked by other conditions. It\u2019s time to shine a light on sepsis, to take it out of the shadows. It\u2019s time to call sepsis what it is: a public health crisis.Dr. Steven Q. Simpson is the Chief Medical Officer of Sepsis Alliance and Professor of Medicine and Acting Director of the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at the University of KansasI  am a sepsis survivor and think your article is excellent.I am so happy that someone is finally talking and bringing sepsis to the public.

            "content": "Written by: Sarah Gehrke, MSN, RNDengue is a re-emerging public health concern with two-fifths of the world population being at risk of infection. It is a mosquito-borne viral infection primarily transmitted by the bite of an infected female of the species\u00a0Aedes aegypti and the species Aedes albopictus.There are five serotypes of the dengue virus: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4, and DENV-5. A person infected by one of the serotypes is immune for life against that specific strain, but is not protected against the other four serotypes.Transmission of the Dengue VirusMosquitoes are necessary for the transmission of the virus\u2014it cannot be spread directly from person to person. A mosquito that transmits the virus is known as a vector, or carrier, of the disease.However, not all mosquitoes spread dengue, only those who have previously bitten an infected person. Once a mosquito becomes infected, it remains infected and can continue to spread the virus throughout the entirety of it\u2019s life, which is roughly 3-4 weeks.In humans, there are two periods of interest when it comes to transmission: the incubation period, which marks the onset of symptoms; and the latency period, the period between infection and the onset of when the person can spread the disease.The incubation period (4-10 days) provides a rough estimate of the latency period, as most individuals have been noted to become infectious within 24 hours pre or post the onset of symptoms. Once infectious, a person can transmit the infection, via the\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes, for 4-5 days (with a maximum of up to 12 days).Presentation of DengueAfter the initial incubation period, those who have become infected by the dengue virus may either be asymptomatic or go through three forms of the disease:The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2016), noted that up to 75 % of all DENV infections are asymptomatic, that is, they have no clinical signs or symptoms of disease.Symptomatic dengue commonly presents as a non-specific, mild to moderate, acute, febrile illness; however, as many as 5 % of dengue infections progress to a severe, life-threatening disease\u2014dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS).Severe forms typically manifest after a 2-7 day febrile phase and are often preceded by warning signs.Symptoms of DengueBecause early clinical findings are non-specific, knowing how to recognize the warning signs of severe infection can reduce the risk of death among patients with severe dengue.Undifferentiated FeverUndifferentiated fever can mimic any number of other acute illnesses with fever\u2014it does not meet case definition criteria for dengue fever. It\u2019s difficult to diagnose based on physical exam and routine tests alone. Unless a specfic dengue diagnostic test is performed, the diagnosis remains unknown.Dengue Fever With or Without HemorrhageDengue fever is the most common and less severe form of the virus. It begins with a sudden onset of high fever that usually lasts between 3-5 days, and is accompanied by the following symptoms:Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) or Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS)The third clinical presentation is DHF, which may progress to DSS. Early symptoms of dengue hemorrhagic fever are similar to those of dengue fever, but 5-7 days after initial onset, the symptoms worsen and may include:The most severe progression of dengue is dengue hemorrhagic shock, also known as dengue shock syndrome. It is characterized by severe low blood pressure caused by hypovolemia, or low blood volume, in relation to severe dehydration and circulatory failure.This phase is also characterized by a significant drop in temperature, which may fool some into believing that the person is recovering, when, in fact, this is the most critical period when caregivers should be most vigilant. Without immediate and appropriate supportive care, its fatality rate is above 20 %; however, this is not the most common scenario.The CDC illustrates the three phases of the DHF infection in figure 3, which include:EpidemiologyDengue is a disease that has spread over time. Currently, it is present in 128 countries and found in mostly tropical and subtropical areas around the world (figure 4). In the last 4-5 decades, the incidence of dengue in the world has increased significantly.Dengue cases are underreported and many cases are misclassified.It is estimated that 390 million dengue infections occur every year, of which 96 million have clinically manifested. Each year, about 500,000 people clinically progress to severe dengue; a large proportion of these cases are children.About 2.5 % of all cases result in fatality.Are you Planning to Travel to Central or South America? Asia? Africa?Before traveling to areas where dengue is endemic, it is important to take certain precautions:Between late 2015 and early 2016, the use of the first vaccine against dengue, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV), or Chimerivax, was approved in several countries for people aged 9-45 years living in endemic areas. Discovery of DENV-5 and other similar strains in the future may further impede the Dengue Vaccine Initiative.There are other live-attenuated vaccines that are currently in developmental phases and clinical trials. At present, the WHO is only recommending the dengue vaccine in areas where data signals a high burden of disease.What Happens if I get Sick with Dengue During my Trip?If dengue is suspected, it is very important that you visit a doctor within the region you are visiting as soon as possible.Currently, there is no specific treatment for dengue, but early detection and medical care lowers fatality rates below 1 %.Liquids, oral and intravenous, are supplied to prevent dehydration, and acetaminophen is used to treat high fever. It is important to avoid taking aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen as these can increase bleeding problems.The condition usually lasts a week or more and is normally not deadly.If you become sick during your trip, you should consider extending your stay until you recovered completely.After Your TripIf you develop dengue-related symptoms, it is important that you visit your doctor to rule out an infection by dengue. You can confuse the symptoms with an acute illness or the flu, but remember that if you are coming from an area where dengue is endemic, it is possible that these symptoms may indicate the presence of dengue. However, do not worry, with appropriate care, rest and hydration, you can recover within a matter of a few days.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"63721bcd27bc7cc6f3e12f912fa0f2a8\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07C1DRD1S,1119328047\";Referenceshttps://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs117/es/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4297835/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3097561/#st1https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050972https://www.passporthealthglobal.com/mx/medicina-del-viajero/prevencion-de-dengue/https://www.amse.es/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=86:dengue-epidemiologia-y-situacion-mundial&catid=42:inf-epidemiologica&Itemid=5\u00a9 2007 Nature Publishing Group Adapted from Whitehead, S.

This is a case of equine Coronavirus (ECoV) and does not effect humans.According to the American Association of Equine Practitioners, coronavirus is spread when feces from an infected horse is ingested by another horse (fecal-oral transmission). The virus can also be transmitted when horses make oral contact with surfaces or objects that are contaminated with infected feces. Stalls, muck forks, manure spreaders, thermometers and clothing are common fomites (objects or materials that carry infection). Coronavirus is most commonly diagnosed in the winter months.Mortality is low but can occur in complicated cases. Exposure to the virus can result in up to 85% infection rate but most animals do not show clinical signs.There is no vaccine for Equine Coronavirus. The best method of prevention is to maintain high standards of sanitation in all equine facilities and careful disposal of manure. When cleaning surfaces\nthat may be contaminated with feces, clean first to remove all traces of organic matter, then disinfect.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"9f24495a95ef25c767bfd742673c2404\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"0911910611,0911910999\";African swine fever update: The Philippines and IndonesiaFlorida: Strangles reported on Marion and Alachua county premisesAnthrax: 1st case of 2020 reported in Central Tablelands, NSWNew Hampshire: Valley fever diagnosed in a rescue dog from ArizonaYour email address will not be published.

            "content": "The first animal study of a pig virus\u2019 potential to jump to another species shows that the virus, once introduced to a select group of birds, is easily transmitted to healthy chickens and turkeys.The researchers who led this work were part of a team that previously found in a lab setting that the virus could infect cells from multiple species, including chickens and humans.In this study, birds that were given the virus developed diarrhea by two days after infection. Healthy birds housed with infected chickens and turkeys also developed diarrhea two days after exposure.That rapid spread of disease surprised the Ohio State University scientists.\u201cWe weren\u2019t even sure the virus would transmit from bird to bird. That\u2019s a significant finding,\u201d said senior author Scott Kenney, assistant professor of veterinary preventive medicine based in Ohio State\u2019s Food Animal Health Research Program at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC) in Wooster.\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s pretty readily able to spread between birds. It\u2019s a little concerning because if the virus gets into one or two animals in a large layer or broiler house, it would probably permeate through the entire house pretty quickly,\u201d Kenney said.Susceptibility to a pig virus can\u2019t ethically be tested in humans \u2013 but the previous work in cells showed the virus attaches itself to the same type of receptor in many different host species.\u201cIf the human cell culture model is as predictive as it was with the chickens, then humans are definitely susceptible to having virus-related disease,\u201d he said.The study is published in the online journal\u00a0Emerging Infectious Diseases.This virus, porcine deltacoronavirus, was first detected in pigs in Asia in 2009 and caused a swine diarrhea outbreak in the United States \u2013 involving Ohio pigs \u2013 in 2014. It is part of the family of pathogens that cause respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in the species they infect.There are four types of coronaviruses. Two illnesses known for life-threatening regional outbreaks, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), were caused by betacoronaviruses. The current respiratory disease outbreak associated with a live animal market in China is also attributed to a betacoronavirus. Deltacoronaviruses historically have been linked to birds, and scientists suspect that this porcine virus originated in an avian species.In this study, researchers worked with 14-day-old chickens and turkeys. In each group, they directly gave 10 birds the virus obtained from an infected pig. Two days later, the researchers allowed uninfected \u201csentinel\u201d chickens and turkeys to live among the infected birds.Most infected birds developed diarrhea at various time points, and the sentinels had mild to moderate diarrhea after joining the infected flock. Based on the length and severity of symptoms, the study showed that turkeys are more susceptible to the virus than chickens.Other signs of disease in the birds included distended intestinal tracts containing gas and yellow liquid, high levels of the virus RNA in swabs of their tracheas and digestive tracts, and increased antibody levels in the directly infected birds and some sentinels, said Patricia Boley, first author of the study and a research associate in Kenney\u2019s lab.\u201cBoth chickens and turkeys were still shedding the virus at 14 days, when the study ended. We don\u2019t know how long either species would continue shedding the virus,\u201d Boley said.Despite the presence of virus RNA in the trachea, the birds showed no signs of respiratory symptoms, which would make this virus more dangerous than enteric \u2013 intestinal \u2013 symptoms. The virus also did not kill the birds, but it can lead to death in piglets.\u201cWe want to figure out why the virus is enteric versus respiratory, and how the hosts respond differently,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cWith piglets we see mortality. We don\u2019t have chickens dying, but we have piglets dying from the virus, so what makes the chickens different in their response to the virus? Maybe we can learn something from chickens and apply it to the pigs so they get less sick from the virus.\u201dThough there is no screening in place to detect this deltacoronavirus in humans, Kenney said it is feasible that humans have been exposed and infected and even had symptoms.\u201cPeople who get gastroenteritis may write it off as food poisoning. Deltacoronaviruses may be in some cases causing human disease, but we don\u2019t know that aspect of it yet,\u201d he said.The virus cannot be transmitted to humans by consumption if the meat is properly cooked, he noted.Your email address will not be published.

These horses completed 14 days with no exposure to an EHV-1 positive horse, no fevers, no symptoms compatible with EHV-1, and two negative tests 7 days apart. These horses were from the second quarantine barn but were moved to separate barns after the race meet ended. 17 horses remain in quarantine at Remington Park, 3 of these are in the Isolation Barn. Enhanced biosecurity measures and twice daily temperature monitoring is in place. ODAFF personnel are on-site and continue to monitor the situation.Subscribe to Outbreak News TVEHV-1 infection in horses can cause respiratory disease, abortion in mares, neonatal foal death and neurological disease. The neurological form of the disease is known as Equine Herpes Myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and may be caused by damage to blood vessels of the brain and spinal cord associated with EHV-1 infection. EHM is most often due to the neuropathogenic strain of EHV-1, but may occasionally be caused by the non-neuropathogenic strain of the virus.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"c3b4d46b20c1d42acb2eeb5ab9c652a0\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1465451439,0323101267,B003KVFKTM,B07L87CDQ7\";EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2-10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days, but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, a twenty-one day isolation period of confirmed positive EHM cases is recommended along with stringent biosecurity protocols. Similar to herpes viruses in other species, the latent form of EHV-1 can reactivate at a later date, but generally with a low viral load posing a low risk of infecting other horses. Humans are not at risk of contracting the virus, however humans can act as an indirect mode of transmission.Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "White-nose syndrome, an often-fatal disease of hibernating bats, has been confirmed for the first time in a\u00a0fringed myotis\u00a0(Myotis thysanodes) in King County, Washington. This finding brings the total number of bat species confirmed with the disease in North America to 13.First seen in North America in 2006 in eastern New York,\u00a0white-nose syndrome\u00a0is a fungal disease that has killed millions of hibernating bats in eastern North America and has now spread to 33 states and seven Canadian provinces. The disease does not affect humans, livestock, or other wildlife.The disease is caused by the fungus\u00a0Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which attacks the skin of hibernating bats and damages their delicate wings, making it difficult to fly. Infected bats often leave hibernation too early, which causes them to burn through their fat reserves and become dehydrated or starve to death.The\u00a0Cedar River Education Center\u00a0near North Bend reported a dead bat outside its facility in April 2017. A biologist with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) retrieved the dead bat and did a field test using Ultraviolet (UV) light to detect the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome. Under UV light, bats with white-nose syndrome usually have an orange glow on their wings.The bat was later confirmed to have white-nose syndrome by the\u00a0University of California, Davis\u00a0School of Veterinary Medicine. To identify the bat species, the\u00a0Northern Arizona University\u2019s Bat Ecology and Genetic Lab\u00a0tested the bat using a genetic method than can identify 92% of the world\u2019s bat species. Although the results did not show a conclusive identification, scientists were able to narrow it down to two closely-related bat species \u2013\u00a0long-eared myotis\u00a0and\u00a0fringed myotis.\u201cWith the possibility of a new bat species affected by white-nose syndrome, we explored ways to confirm the species using additional genetic testing,\u201d said Abby Tobin, white-nose syndrome coordinator for WDFW. \u201cFortunately, our partners at the\u00a0U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Wildlife Health Center\u00a0in Madison, WI stepped up to the challenge.\u201damzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"6a7b7cb212eb27405e356a125e83e997\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1588346471,B000HHQBKO,0544815599,142205005X,1297013158,1495911187,1422050068,1628558954\";Jeff Lorch, a microbiologist at the USGS National Wildlife Health Center, used nuclear DNA testing to confirm the bat as a fringed myotis in December 2019.\u201cThere are two parts of a cell that carry DNA \u2013 the nucleus and the mitochondria,\u201d said Lorch. \u201cMost bat genetic testing has used mitochondria DNA, which does not allow us to distinguish the long-eared bat from the fringed bat. By using nuclear DNA, we were able to get more accurate results.\u201dFringed bats are widely dispersed in dry forests throughout western North America from Mexico to British Columbia. However, there is a lack of data on the bat\u2019s population size, health trends, or where they hibernate in winter.\u201cTracking white-nose syndrome and its effects on bat populations is challenging when little is known about bats in Washington, and this species in particular,\u201d said Tobin. \u201cThe confirmation of white-nose syndrome in another bat species is a reminder of how much we still have to learn about this devastating disease.\u201dIn 2016, scientists first documented white-nose syndrome in Washington near North Bend in King County. Since then, WDFW has confirmed 46 cases of the disease and/or the fungus in four bat species in the state. A timeline of fungus and white-nose syndrome detections in Washington is available online at\u00a0https://wdfw.wa.gov/bats.WDFW staff urge people to not handle wild animals, and to not touch bats that appear sick or are found dead. Even though the fungus is primarily spread by bats themselves, humans can unintentionally spread it as well. People can carry fungal spores on clothing, shoes, or recreation equipment that touches the fungus.Those who find sick or dead bats, or notice bats acting strangely, such as flying outside during the day or in freezing weather, can report their sighting online at\u00a0https://wdfw.wa.gov/bats\u00a0or call WDFW at 360-902-2515. WDFW also seeks reports of groups of healthy bats.Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "A moose in northwest Montana tested positive for chronic wasting disease, marking the first time the disease has been detected in the species in Montana.A hunter harvested the bull moose in late October near Pulpit Mountain west of Quartz Creek and north of Troy. The harvest occurred less than half a mile to the west of the existing Libby CWD Management Zone.Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks collected the voluntary sample from the moose and submitted it for testing to the Veterinary Diagnostic Lab at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. The lab identified it to be suspected of CWD infection and confirmed the positive detection with a second test.CWD was first detected in white-tailed deer in the Libby area earlier this year, leading to the creation of the Libby CWD Management Zone. To date, there have been 30 positive detections in deer. Five of those involved deer harvested by hunters during archery and general hunting season. The detections of infected deer have all occurred within the Libby CWD Management Zone, and all but one has been centralized near the city center.FWP will continue to conduct CWD surveillance through the hunting season and review sample results after the season to potentially update future sampling efforts. FWP encourages hunters to submit animals for testing in areas adjacent to the Libby CWD Management Zone.CWD is a fatal disease that can affect the nervous system of mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk and moose. Transmission can most commonly occur through direct contact between cervids, as well as shed in urine, feces, saliva, blood and antler velvet from infected cervids. Carcasses of infected cervids may serve as a source of environmental contamination as well and can infect other cervids that come into contact with that carcass.There is no known transmission of CWD to humans or other animals, including pets or livestock. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that hunters harvesting a deer, elk, or moose from an area where CWD is known to be present have their animal tested for CWD prior to consuming the meat, and to not consume the meat if the animal tests positive.Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "Researchers at the National Institutes of Health found evidence that specific immune cells may play a key role in the devastating effects of cerebral malaria, a severe form of malaria that mainly affects young children. The results, published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, suggest that drugs targeting T cells may be effective in treating the disease. The study was supported by the NIH Intramural Research Program.\u201cThis is the first study showing that T cells target blood vessels in brains of children with cerebral malaria,\u201d said Dorian McGavern, Ph.D., chief of the Viral Immunology and Intravital Imaging Section at the NIH\u2019s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) who co-directed the study with Susan Pierce, Ph.D., chief of the Laboratory of Immunogenetics at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). \u201cThese findings build a bridge between mouse and human cerebral malaria studies by implicating T cells in the development of disease pathology in children. It is well established that T cells cause the brain vasculature injury associated with cerebral malaria in mice, but this was not known in humans.\u201dMore than 200 million people worldwide are infected annually with mosquito-borne parasites that cause malaria. In a subset of those patients, mainly young children, the parasites accumulate in brain blood vessels causing cerebral malaria, which leads to increased brain pressure from swelling. Even with available treatment, cerebral malaria still kills up to 25% of those affected resulting in nearly 400,000 deaths annually. Children who survive the infection will often have long-lasting neurological problems such as cognitive impairment.Read more at NIHYour email address will not be published.

            "content": "A new paper published in the journal\u00a0BMJ Case Reports shows this entirely preventable viral infection can affect many different organs in the body.Measles is a highly contagious respiratory viral infection, the symptoms of which include fever, cough, conjunctivitis, and an extensive rash all over the body.Measles is entirely preventable as the vaccine used to immunise against it is safe and very effective.But in the past few decades, unfounded fears about the vaccine have prompted it to re-emerge as a health scourge around the world, with rising numbers of cases in teens and adults, say the authors.In 2017 the global death toll from measles reached 110,000. Most of these deaths were in young children.The authors treated three people with measles who had additional complications as a direct result of their infection.The first case concerned a young man, who had only had the first of two doses of measles vaccine as a child. He was additionally diagnosed with hepatitis.The second case involved a young woman who developed appendicitis associated with measles. In the third case, a middle aged man complained of blurred vision and severe headache. He was diagnosed with viral meningitis, caused by his measles infection.All three people recovered fully after appropriate treatment and care, and none had any long lasting health problems as a result of their illness.But because measles suppresses the immune system, it has been associated with complications in every organ of the body, note the authors. Almost a third of all reported cases are associated with one or more complications, they point out.These can include pneumonia, febrile seizures, and encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord) which causes neurological problems.Another possible complication of measles is SSPE (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis), a progressive neurological disorder that causes permanent nervous system damage and leads to a vegetative state.Measles and SSPE: Progressive, disabling, and fatal\u201cLarge outbreaks with fatalities are currently ongoing in European countries which had previously eliminated or interrupted endemic transmission,\u201d write the authors, adding that in the first six months of 2019 alone, 10,000 measles cases were reported in Europe.They attribute the rise in new cases to negative publicity in the early 2000s linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism, despite major studies proving otherwise. This prompted a fall in vaccine uptake and collective (\u2018herd\u2019) immunity.\u201cUrgent efforts are needed to ensure global coverage with two-dose measles vaccines through education and strengthening of national immunization systems,\u201d they conclude.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Good reads\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"ed1485e9ec616100d9f8991894657468\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1421426609,1681777517,B000ROKXVA,0231186991\";Your email address will not be published.

Additionally, practicing good hand hygiene, including thoroughly washing hands after using the bathroom, changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food, plays an important role in preventing the spread of hepatitis A.Got Smallpox?amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"646a6d88f43457ab2af125251ef579f5\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B00256Z2E6,142141757X\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";Anyone can benefit from vaccination against hepatitis A.

The primary means of transmission in the United States is person-to-person, rather than through contaminated food or water. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay-colored bowel movements, joint pain, and jaundice. These symptoms usually go away on their own, however, they can lead to serious health problems, including death, in people with already poor health (e.g., hepatitis B and C infections, chronic liver disease).Your email address will not be published.

He had no recent overseas travel history, and no known contact with COVID-19 confirmed cases. The patient began to cough January 27, and went to a hospital February 3 for shortness of breath, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia. He was hospitalized in a negative pressure isolation ward the same day. On the evening of February 15, the patient died of pneumonia-induced sepsis. With his family members\u2019 consent, the patient\u2019s remains will be cremated in accordance with legal requirements for communicable diseases. Tissue specimens will first be taken for further testing.The second confirmed case is a male in his 50s, a member of the first case\u2019s family. He was confirmed infected with COVID-19 after lab tests February 15. So far, this patient shows no symptoms of COVID-19, and is being treated in a negative pressure isolation ward.Coronavirus becoming a pandemic?On today\u2019s airing of Face the Nation, host Margaret Brennan asked the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Anthony Fauci is the coronavirus situation is becoming a pandemic.Fauci said, \u201cA pandemic is when you have multiple countries throughout the world have what\u2019s called sustained transmission\u2013from person to person to person\u2013multiple generations.\u201cRight now there are 24 countries in which there are over 500 cases.

During the first six weeks of 2020, 2,129 dengue cases have been reported, a 60 percent increase over last year at this time.In 2019, some 16,000 dengue cases were reported in Singapore, one of the worst years as far as numbers of cases (3rd most ever).One of the biggest concerns for 2020 is the increase in circulation of DENV-3 serotype, which could lead to weekly dengue cases rising above current levels in 2020.Singapore officials says the\u00a0Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector for the transmission of dengue. It breeds well indoors, in clean, stagnant water easily found in our homes. To prevent an increase in dengue cases, residents and stakeholders must take proactive dengue prevention measures by practicing the following steps immediately and frequently, to remove stagnant water in our surroundings: Turn over the pail, Tip the vase, Flip the flower pot plate, Loosen the hardened soil and clear the roof gutter and place Bti insecticide inside.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Travel accessories\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"3a5f109bab72b122e36e3a40eff193c2\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07FTHN8YV,B005AIIPLS,B01CNYRZ8A,B07LFX17TM,B0027RWNN6,B01M35M87O,B07BPZTQYG,B01IEJHJWK,B017SKRWL4\";Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "As coronavirus spreads across the globe via infected air travelers, authorities are attempting to contain the outbreak and avoid a pandemic. A study published in Risk Analysis analyzes the impact of implementing disease mitigation strategies at airports across the globe. The study finds that increasing traveler engagement with proper hand-hygiene at all airports has the potential to reduce the risk of a potential pandemic by 24-69 percent. The researchers also identified ten critical airports, central to the global air-transportation network, and if hand-washing mitigation strategies are implemented in just these ten locations, the pandemic risk can drop by up to 37 percent.The study, \u201cHand-hygiene mitigation strategies against global disease spreading through the air transportation network,\u201d suggests that if increased hand-washing practices were instituted in ten key there would be a significant impact on decreasing the spread of viruses. These ten airports are not just locations that see large volumes of passengers, they also connect travelers with destinations in all parts of the world.The airports include:\u201cAirports, and airplanes, are highly infectious because they are close, confined areas with large, mobile populations,\u201d states Christos Nicolaides, Ph.D., lead author, University of Cyprus and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). \u201cViruses are spread through bodily fluids, so keeping hands clean at major transport hubs is central to control spread.\u201dAirports also contain numerous highly contaminated surfaces that are frequently touched by travelers, including self-service check-in screens, gate bench armrests, water fountain buttons, door handles, seats and tray tables. In addition to increasing the frequency at which public areas are cleaned and sanitized, using proper coughing etiquette, wearing face masks and proper hand hygiene practices are the most common actions that can be adopted by air travelers.Currently, analyses show that, at most, one in five people have clean hands at any given moment. If hand cleanliness at all airports increased from 20 percent to 30 percent, by increasing the capacity and/or awareness of hand-washing, the impact of a potential infectious disease would have a global impact that is 24 percent smaller. A cost-effective measure would be to adopt these practices at the top 10 influential airports, reducing the impact of the disease spreading to just 37 percent.Your email address will not be published.

There are polio outbreaks in several countries in Africa. The following 15 countries have been reporting outbreaks: Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, Togo and Zambia.The World Health Organization recommends that these countries require residents and long-term (4 weeks or more) visitors show proof of polio vaccination before leaving the country.CDC recommends that all travelers to the countries listed above be vaccinated fully against polio. Adults who were fully vaccinated during childhood should receive an additional (single) lifetime booster dose of polio vaccine. Even if you were vaccinated as a child or have been sick with polio before, you may need a booster dose to make sure you are protected.Polio\u00a0is a crippling and potentially deadly disease that affects the nervous system. Good hand washing practices can help prevent the spread of this disease. Because the virus lives in the feces (poop) of an infected person, people infected with the disease can spread it to others when they do not wash their hands well after defecating (pooping). People can also be infected if they drink water or eat food contaminated with infected feces.Most people with polio do not feel sick. Some people have only minor symptoms, such as fever, tiredness, nausea, headache, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, stiffness in the neck and back, and pain in the arms and legs. In rare cases, polio infection causes permanent loss of muscle function (paralysis). Polio can be fatal if the muscles used for breathing are paralyzed or if there is an infection of the brain.Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "Army scientists working with partners from industry and academia have developed an experimental treatment that protects animals from Sudan virus, which is closely related to Ebola. Their work is published online today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.There are six distinct species of ebolaviruses, which collectively pose a significant threat to the global community, particularly in areas of equatorial and West Africa. While Ebola virus was the causative agent of the 2013-2016 outbreak that developed into the largest epidemic in recorded history, Sudan virus also presents a significant health threat, according to the authors.One promising approach to treating ebolavirus infection involves the development of immunotherapies\u2013drugs that boost the body\u2019s own immune system to fight infection. Scientists can design proteins, called antibodies, and combine them into \u201ccocktails\u201d to treat a particular type of infectious disease. Until now, however, there has been no such cocktail specific for Sudan virus.Led by John M. Dye, Ph.D. of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, the team produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies that are specifically designed to attach to the Sudan virus glycoprotein and block the virus from entering cells. They tested them in cell culture, and further evaluated the most promising candidates in a mouse model of Sudan virus infection.MARBURG Virus detected in fruit bats in Sierra LeoneBased on the results of the rodent testing, the team then selected a mixture of two Sudan-specific monoclonal antibodies for assessment in rhesus macaques. This mixture, called RIID F6-H2, provided protection from Sudan virus in rhesus macaques when administered on days 4 and 6 post-infection.\u201cWe are excited to offer a potential treatment option against one of the most deadly human pathogens known,\u201d said Dye. \u201cBeing prepared by having countermeasures against emerging infectious diseases allows the global community to try to stay one step ahead, rather than play \u2018catch-up\u2019 against potential pandemic viruses.\u201dAccording to COL E. Darrin Cox, commander of USAMRIID, the work highlights the impact of USAMRIID research on warfighter health and public health.amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"edd8c068ee7f0798872725317f73f785\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1640121420,0393346617\";\u201cIn addition, the sheer number of collaborators is a testament to the importance of government, academic and commercial laboratories working together to advance medical countermeasure development,\u201d said Cox.Co-investigators on the study included Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc., Fraunhofer, BioFactura, and The Geneva Foundation.\u201cOur team is extremely proud that this cocktail of antibodies is now being considered for advancement into phase 1 clinical studies,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Herbert of USAMRIID, the paper\u2019s first author. \u201cWe have the opportunity to make a real impact on global health.\u201dYour email address will not be published.

The quality of these initial samples enabled rapid cell-culture isolation of the new virus. The Institut Pasteur\u2019s scientists now have access to the virus responsible for the infection. The isolation of the virus paves the way for new diagnostic, therapeutic and prophylactic approaches.With the whole viral genome of coronavirus 2019-nCoV having recently been sequenced at the Institut Pasteur, the isolation of strains of coronavirus 2019-nCoV detected in France has now been successfully finalized, in a very short space of time, using the samples taken from the first confirmed French cases.Coronavirus 2019-nCoV, responsible for the cases of pneumonia that emerged in China, differs from two other viruses that are well known for causing respiratory outbreaks in recent years: the SARS-CoV virus, responsible for the SARS outbreak in 2003, and MERS-CoV, responsible for an outbreak that has been under way since 2012 in the Middle East.The Institut Pasteur was actively involved in tackling these previous outbreaks, which yielded valuable lessons for the current situation. \u201cFor both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cells known as Vero E6 were identified to culture the two coronaviruses,\u201d explains Sylvie van der Werf, Director of the National Reference Center (CNR) for Respiratory Viruses at the Institut Pasteur. \u201cIn January 2020, we brought them out of our collection, which is kept under strictly controlled conditions, so that we would be ready as soon as we detected a positive sample for coronavirus 2019-nCoV.\u201dRead more at Institut PasteurYour email address will not be published.

An oubreak of meningococcal disease due to serogroup C is not unexpected in Benin at this time of the year. There is a vaccine available to travelers that can help prevent infection against meningococcal disease caused by\u00a0Neisseria meningitidis\u00a0serogroup C.Health officials are reporting that a smaller number of cases in this outbreak have been caused by\u00a0Neisseria meningitidis\u00a0serogroup X. There is no vaccine that prevents infection against meningococcal disease caused by\u00a0Neisseria meningitidis\u00a0serogroup X.CDC recommends all travelers to Benin aged 2 months or older should be vaccinated against\u00a0Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y prior to departure.Two meningococcal vaccines are available in the United States that protect against infection from serogroups A, C, W, and Y. Children younger than 2 years of age are recommended to receive 2\u20134 doses of serogroup A, C, W, Y vaccine before traveling, depending on age. For adults and children 2 years of age and older, just a single dose is needed. Approximately 7\u201310 days are required after vaccination for the development of protective antibody levels.Since 2005, most adolescents in the United States receive vaccination against serogroups A, C, W, and Y. Protection from the serogroup A, C, W, Y vaccine only lasts for a few years, however, so people who were vaccinated more than 3\u20135 years ago (depending on age) are recommended to receive an additional dose before traveling.Vaccination against\u00a0Neisseria meningitidis\u00a0serogroup B (also available in the United States) is not indicated for this outbreak. There is no vaccine for serogroup X.Close contacts of a person with meningococcal disease should receive antibiotics to keep them from getting sick. Close contacts include people in the same household, roommates, or anyone with direct contact with a patient\u2019s saliva (such as a boyfriend or girlfriend).Guinea worm disease: 53 cases reported in 2019, Vast majority in ChadLassa fever: Nigeria reports nearly 100 cases in past weekMalaria: Burundi reports an 88 percent increase in cases in 2019Uganda reports yellow fever outbreakamzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"ab9d1c2195ad67cebe841c9eeda1f5c1\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07LFX17TM,B005AIIPLS,B017SKRWL4,B01IEJHJWK,B0793FBN4Z,B073D1Y32L,B01I1430WQ,B001CZPAD4\";Your email address will not be published.

Meanwhile, 18 cases of PUI were negative (12 Malaysians, 5 Chinese and 1 Jordanian) and had been discharged from the hospital. While four (4) of these PUI cases (2 Malaysian and 2 Chinese) were placed in isolation in several hospitals, their lab results will be known in the near future.Meanwhile, of the 8 Chinese nationals who were in direct contact with Singapore\u2019s first 2019-nCoV positive case, 3 of them were positive, a 65-year-old woman and two 2- and 11-year-old boys. There were 5 negative cases in which 4 people were sent back to China while another accompanied her children to the hospital.Meanwhile, the 17 people who were in contact with the fourth positive case meeting were placed under the Monitoring and Exit Order at the designated premises pending their test results.All four positive cases are in stable condition and are being monitored in isolation wards at MOH hospitals that have been identified as the reference hospitals for 2019-nCoV.Considering the current situation, MOH continues to improve the prevention and control of the Novel Coronavirus infection outbreak. The suspected cases will be inspected and referred to the hospital for sampling and monitoring of case symptoms.

Wuhan, and do a good job of health management for personnel with a history of travel in Wuhan.\u00a0Promote prevention and control experience in Beijing and Hebei province, and detect cases early.\u00a0Refund air, rail, highway, and water passengers free of charge, and suspend the travel activities of travel clubs.\u00a0Control and organize large-scale activities, reduce the gathering of people, issue public prevention guidelines on tourism, family, public places, public transportation, home observation, etc., implement measures for ventilation, disinfection, and temperature measurement of key places and closed transportation, and strictly prevent the passage of traffic Tools to spread the outbreak.\u00a0At the same time, strengthen market control of wildlife.\u00a02020-01-26 15:04:14\n\u3000\u3000Ma Xiaowei: The\n\u3000\u3000fourth is to go all out to treat patients.\u00a0The diagnosis and treatment plan was revised in a timely manner, and the list of designated hospitals at the county level or above and the hot clinics were announced to the society.\u00a0Strengthen medical treatment, strictly follow the principle of \u201cconcentrating patients, experts, resources, and treatment\u201d, pay attention to the integration of traditional Chinese and western medicine, and implement \u201cone person, one case\u201d for severe cases to minimize deaths.\u00a0Implement a subsidy policy for patient assistance to ensure that no one can affect treatment due to cost issues.\nFifth, step up scientific research.\u00a0Establish a national scientific research expert group, start the implementation of emergency projects, adhere to the problem-oriented, and focus on scientific and technological research in the areas of virus traceability, drug screening, traditional Chinese medicine prevention and treatment, intensive care, and vaccine research and development.\nSixth, do a good job in propaganda and interpretation.\u00a0Every day before 8 am, the National Health and Health Commission released the epidemic data of the previous day, organized experts to do a good job of interpretation, and spread knowledge of epidemic prevention to the society.\nSeventh, deepen exchanges and cooperation.\u00a0The World Health Organization was notified of the epidemic situation in a timely manner, shared technical information, and shared the entire genome sequence of some strains. The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tan Desai, thanked the Chinese government and believed that China\u2019s leadership in global health was reflected.\u00a0Experts from the World Health Organization are invited to visit Wuhan, and experts from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan are arranged to conduct field trips to Wuhan. After an assessment, the World Health Organization has announced that the epidemic situation will not be identified as a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d for the time being.\nAt present, the epidemic prevention and control is in a critical period.\u00a0Experts believe that the week of the Spring Festival is the best window period for \u201cgreat isolation and disinfection\u201d to play its role, and it is also a key period for the epidemic to be suppressed outside Wuhan.\u00a0Next, under the leadership of the Central Epidemic Response Leading Group, we will take epidemic prevention and control as the top priority, classify guidance, implement precise policies, and scientifically prevent and control according to law.\u00a02020-01-26 15:09:09\n\u3000\u3000Ma Xiaowei:\n\u3000\u3000One is to\u00a0keep an eye\u00a0on Wuhan.\u00a0Urge Hubei Province and Wuhan City to adopt the strictest prevention and control measures in accordance with the law, strictly close contact with people at home, reduce all kinds of gathering activities of the masses, detect cases and suspected illnesses in time, strictly prevent death, and resolutely curb the epidemic.\nThe second is keeping an eye on the country.\u00a0Comprehensive mobilization, comprehensive deployment, comprehensive strengthening, community prevention and control, and strict management of personnel from Wuhan to various provinces within 15 days.\u00a0Giving play to the role of community streets, ensuring that people are tracked, registered, community management, on-site observation, epidemic situation is found, and immediately transferred to conditional medical institutions for isolation.\u00a0Here, it is important to emphasize the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control in rural areas, give full play to the role of township hospitals and county hospitals, strengthen the leadership of local governments at the township level, and resolutely prevent the epidemic from spreading in rural areas.\nThe third is to make every effort to strengthen case management.\u00a0Severe cases are concentrated in the hospital with the strongest comprehensive strength in each place, or a specialist in respiratory department is dispatched by the local hospital with a strong comprehensive strength, and is on duty 24 hours a day.\u00a0Integrate Chinese and Western medicine and make every effort to reduce severe cases and deaths.\u00a0Medical staff in Hubei Province, especially Wuhan City, have been fighting for a long time in the front line, trying their best to treat patients, control the epidemic, and put in hard work, showing the lofty spirit of great love.\u00a0Today and tomorrow, we will send another 12 teams of 1,600 people to the urgently needed materials for epidemic prevention and control. The relevant departments are stepping up coordination to ensure timely and full availability.\nAn epidemic is an order, and prevention and control is a responsibility.\u00a0We will go all out to do a good job in prevention and control, give full play to the institutional advantages of socialism with Chinese characteristics, use our accumulated experience in the prevention and control of major public health events, and rely on the majority of medical workers and the people to fight an epidemic. In the People\u2019s War, we have the confidence, determination, and ability to win the epidemic.\u00a02020-01-26 15:12:17\n\u3000\u3000attack Yanchun:\n\u3000\u3000Thank you Mr. Ma Xiaowei.\u00a0Let \u2019s start asking questions.\u00a0Please inform your news organization before asking questions.\u00a02020-01-26 15:14:08\n\u3000\u3000CCTV reporter CCTV:\n\u3000\u3000Yesterday the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee made a lot of important deployments on epidemic prevention and control. How should we implement these deployments in the next step and what measures are there?\u00a0Thank you.\u00a02020-01-26 15:14:26\n\u3000\u3000Ma Xiaowei:\n\u3000\u3000\u201dOne point deployment, nine points implementation\u201d, and the effective implementation of the central government\u2019s measures on epidemic prevention and control is the key to controlling the spread of the epidemic and achieving victory in the battle of prevention and control.\nThe first is to give full play to our institutional and mechanism advantages.\u00a0The Party Central Committee decided to set up a leading group for the response to the epidemic, and work under the leadership of the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau.\u00a0At the same time, a steering group was dispatched to areas with severe outbreaks in Hubei.\u00a0We also have a joint prevention and control mechanism composed of many departments. This leadership system is conducive to national overall planning, military and territory coordination, mobilizing medical resources and materials in all aspects of the country, ensuring necessary prevention and control work, and working closely to cooperate closely.\nThe second is to further implement territorial responsibility.\u00a0In particular, strengthen the responsibility of local party committees and governments at all levels.\u00a0The implementation of territorial responsibility is not only a requirement of the central government, but also a requirement of laws such as the Law on Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases, and it is also a requirement of the current prevention and control work.\u00a0As far as we know, the provinces have generally established a leadership system in which party committees and governments are mainly responsible for comrades in charge and a joint prevention and control mechanism involving multiple departments.\nThe third is to strengthen guidance on prevention and control in various places.\u00a0The Health and Health Commission has conducted the first round of full-scale supervision of the prevention and control work in all provinces across the country, supervising the implementation of various prevention and control measures.\u00a0The relevant departments of the State Council \u2019s joint prevention and control work mechanism will also carry out supervision as necessary.\u00a0At the same time, we will send working groups to the provinces one after another to guide local governments to carry out prevention and control work.\u00a0It is particularly emphasized that since the outbreak of the epidemic, the majority of medical staff have worked hard, and the citizens of traffic control areas such as Wuhan have actively cooperated with preventive and control measures to create conditions for further controlling the spread of the epidemic.\u00a0We believe that with the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core and the strong backing of the people across the country, we will surely win the battle against epidemic prevention and control.\u00a02020-01-26 15:20:34\n\u3000\u3000Liu Xiaoming:\n\u3000\u3000Let me do a supplementary introduction.\u00a0After the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee yesterday, the Ministry of Transport attached great importance to earnestly implementing the important instructions of General Secretary Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang on epidemic prevention work, studying overnight, implementing and deploying.\u00a0The epidemic situation is an order, and prevention and control is a responsibility. From 22nd to 25th, Comrade Chuandang and Comrade Xiaopeng of the Ministry of Transport held six working meetings of the prevention and control mechanism. Strengthen dispatching, especially with Hubei and Wuhan transportation departments.\u00a0There are several areas of focus, and I can report to you:\nwe launched timely prevention and control deployment.\u00a0On January 21, the Ministry of Transport initiated a secondary emergency response to prevent and control the pneumonia epidemic of the new coronavirus infection, established a joint prevention and control mechanism for the Ministry of Transport, and deployed overnight to adapt to local conditions such as cars and ships Relevant measures such as ventilation, disinfection and passenger temperature detection shall be conducted with stations, docks, and highway service areas.\u00a0At present, the prevention and control of the epidemic situation is also superimposed on the protection of the Spring Festival transportation. We also hope that the majority of travellers can actively strengthen self-protection, scientifically arrange itineraries, and consciously cooperate with inspection and isolation work.\u00a0Working together, I believe we will be able to win this tough battle.\u00a02020-01-26 15:21:12\n\u3000\u3000Wang Jiangping: After the\n\u3000\u3000epidemic, the party group of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology attaches great importance to it, and our task is to take the lead to do a good job of preventing and controlling material security.\u00a0Because the Spring Festival holiday period, the contradiction between supply and demand of prevention and control materials is very prominent, we have taken several measures to strengthen the security work.\nThe first is the general mobilization of the national industrial information system. Various agencies and production enterprises have overcome various difficulties and have tried everything to resume work and production.\nThe second is to establish a dispatching system for key prevention and control material production enterprises.\nThe third is to actively promote the establishment of a national temporary reserve system for prevention and control materials to ensure the procurement reserves for prevention and control materials.\nThe fourth is to guide the e-commerce platform to control prices, flow, and reasonable delivery, and establish a supply and demand mechanism for e-commerce.\nThe fifth is to do everything possible to ensure the demand for Wuhan prevention and control materials.\u00a0Since the 23rd, we have received a list of four batches of supplies in Wuhan. They are roughly more than 20 varieties in four categories. Most of the supplies can meet the needs, but the demand for supplies such as protective clothing and masks is very prominent. .\u00a0Everyone knows that China is a big country of production, but because of the Spring Festival holiday, our production capacity has not been realized. Through the efforts during this period, the resumption of production and production has reached 40%, but products such as protective clothing are still difficult to meet demand.\u00a0The demand list provided to us by Hubei Province is roughly 100,000 pieces of medical protective clothing per day, and 3 million pieces per month.\u00a0However, there are only 40 companies that meet China\u2019s standard production capacity licenses, distributed in 14 provinces. The total production capacity is only 30,000 units per day, and the contradiction between supply and demand is very prominent.\nIn addition, we do have a part of the production capacity for export, which is about 50,000 sets per day, but without the Chinese standard license, it will take a little time to switch to domestic sales.\nIn the next step, we must do everything possible to ensure the needs of the epidemic area. We understand that Wuhan Hospital is short of supplies. Comrades in our material security team are very worried.\u00a0In the next step, we must take more measures to do everything possible to ensure the demand of Wuhan.\u00a0First, we must use the central reserve to ensure the needs of the affected areas.\u00a0Second, we must do everything possible to resume work and resume production, and rapidly increase the current production capacity from 40%.\u00a0Third, we must promote the convergence of export standards with Chinese standards so that export products that meet EU standards and US standards can be used in some areas of China.\u00a0Finally, we need to strengthen international cooperation.\u00a0In fact, we have promoted international procurement to address domestic needs, and I will add so much.\u00a02020-01-26 15:24:31\n\u3000\u3000Xi\nYanchun\u00a0: Do\u3000\u3000foreign journalists have any concerns?\u00a02020-01-26 15:36:37\n\u3000\u3000AFP reporter:\n\u3000\u3000I have two questions. The first is about traffic restrictions.\u00a0We know that some Chinese cities have begun to implement restrictions on public transportation and intercity transportation. I would like to ask whether such restrictions will be extended to the whole country?\u00a0The second is about the severity of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic. Will this outbreak be more severe than SARS, and will mortality and infection rates be better than SARS?\u00a02020-01-26 15:37:13\n\u3000\u3000Ma Xiaowei:\n\u3000\u3000I asked two questions just now. The first question asked Director Li Bin of the Health and Health Committee to answer.\u00a02020-01-26 15:42:09\n\u3000\u3000Li Bin:\n\u3000\u3000Regarding your concerns, it actually involves the measures we are currently taking, and transportation-related management is one aspect.\u00a0The measures we are taking now are constantly adjusted according to the needs of the epidemic situation, and these adjustments are made in accordance with laws and regulations.\u00a0At present, these measures are the most severe measures. Both internationally and domestically, they are measures based on the accumulated experience in the actual fight against infectious diseases.\u00a0If these measures can be implemented, experts estimate that the spread of the epidemic is expected to be curbed, the intensity of the epidemic will be weakened, and the peak of the epidemic will be delayed, making time for the next stage of more effective prevention and control.\nIn addition, the question you are concerned about actually involves the next step of the epidemic.\u00a0We pay close attention to this.\u00a0From our understanding, this disease is a new disease, and humans have limited knowledge of it. It is not clear about the possible changes in the disease, and the progress of the epidemic is not fully controlled in our hands. We will The epidemic situation is constantly changing, policies are continuously adjusted, measures are perfected, and various prevention and control requirements are implemented.\u00a0In this way, we can be fully prepared to continuously improve our ability to respond to changes in the epidemic, effectively achieve prevention and control goals, and control the epidemic.\u00a02020-01-26 15:42:27\n\u3000\u3000Liu Xiaoming:\n\u3000\u3000I would like to answer a question from AFP reporters.\u00a0Your question is very good.\u00a0Because transportation, especially transportation, is a way to spread the virus, some places and cities have restrictions on modes of transportation and transportation. This is necessary, and it can effectively block the transmission of the virus through this method. aisle.\nI think journalists may have paid attention to this. For example, Beijing suspended the operation of long-distance passenger transport yesterday. It turned out that the long-distance passenger transport of Beijing was suspended from the first to the fourth day, and resumed from the fifth day. This work has now been suspended.\u00a0At the same time, you may notice that there is a subway in Shanghai connecting with Suzhou, and it will no longer be in the direction of Jiangsu at 1 o\u2019clock this afternoon.\u00a0The purpose is to keep the soil responsible and block the channels of virus transmission.\u00a0We think these measures are still very effective. There is an old saying in China, \u201cThe shoes don\u2019t fit well, I know best\u201d.\u00a0When party committees and governments in various places make overall arrangements for their own measures, they will take measures according to local conditions.\nEveryone is also concerned that, from the perspective of the transportation department, in addition to some of the situations just described, we have some deployments for long-distance passenger transportation, civil aviation, and railway. On the one hand, we must implement ventilation and disinfection of transportation, and set up reservations at some stations. Observation room, if abnormal body temperature is measured, further monitoring should be conducted in observation room. It is indeed necessary for the health department to make unified arrangements.\nOne point, I need to explain to you that some cities have taken some measures that will not affect the operation of the entire city. The reasonable travel of ordinary people can be guaranteed, the transportation of key materials can be guaranteed, and the living materials of ordinary people are also given priority.\nYou may also notice that in order to reduce the flow of people, railways, civil aviation, and road traffic implemented the policy of refunding fares for the first time. The original policy was only for entering and leaving Wuhan, but later expanded to the whole country, reflecting the government\u2019s greater concern for the travel of ordinary people.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a02020-01-26 15:42:56\n\u3000\u3000Ma Xiaowei:\n\u3000\u3000Since the outbreak, scientists in China, especially virologists, have done a lot of work. One week after the outbreak, a new coronavirus was isolated from patient samples and the pathogens were found.\u00a0From the perspective of gene sequencing, the new coronavirus is a new strain that is different from the SARS virus and the MERS virus. A new member has been added to the coronavirus family.\u00a0Judging from the clinical epidemiological data, it was initially understood that the virus may have changed from wild animals to humans in the early days, and now it gradually began to adapt to survive in humans and enter the period of human-to-human transmission. From the current clinical cases, there are In some severe cases and some mild cases, the virus has begun to spread from person to person.\u00a0According to recent clinical data, the transmission of the virus seems to have increased, and the toxicity and pathogenicity of the virus need to be analyzed based on more clinical data.\nJudging from the present, the spread of the epidemic situation is relatively fast, which brings some challenges and pressures to prevention and control.\u00a0Experts predict that the epidemic is now entering a more severe and complicated period, and the measures taken by Wuhan\u2019s prevention and control work have played an important role in controlling the epidemic.\u00a0Judging from the work across the country, the epidemic is still in its early stages of spread.\u00a0Now the country has taken more powerful measures. These measures should be able to control the epidemic at a lower cost and faster speed, and achieve the final victory in this prevention and control work.\u00a02020-01-26 15:59:06\n\u3000\u3000China Ratings Agency:\n\u3000\u3000Why does the government start to \u201ccatch the city\u201d when more than 300 pneumonia patients appear in Wuhan\u00a0?\u00a0Does the government conceal the actual number of patients and suspected patient data?\u00a0What is the actual number of people currently infected in Wuhan?\u00a0Thank you.\u00a02020-01-26 16:46:22\n\u3000\u3000Li Bin:\n\u3000\u3000The actual number of people infected in Wuhan has been posted on the website of the Health and Health Commission, and I will give you a briefing.\u00a0Our committee received a report from the Hubei Health and Health Committee. As of 24:00 on January 25, Wuhan City, Hubei Province had reported a total of 618 confirmed cases, of which 40 were discharged, 533 are currently hospitalized, and 45 have died.\u00a0There were also 140 severe cases among the hospitalized cases, and Wuhan City, Hubei Province also reported 112 existing suspected cases.\nWuhan City, Hubei Province, a new coronavirus infection prevention and control headquarters issued a notice on January 23, the city \u2019s bus, subway, ferry, and long-distance buses were suspended. Citizens cannot leave Wuhan for no special reason. At the same time, the airport and train station leave the Han corridor. shut down.\u00a0Now the highway is gradually closing.\u00a0These measures are necessary to prevent the epidemic from spreading further and curb the spread of the epidemic.\u00a0These measures will have an effect on the epidemic control in Wuhan and will also have an effect on the national epidemic control.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a02020-01-26 16:46:47\n\u3000\u3000TASS News\nAgency\u00a0:\u3000\u3000Regarding the problem of the epidemic, how long does it take to process the epidemic?\u00a0Any comments?\u00a0Thank you.\u00a02020-01-26 17:10:19\n\u3000\u3000Ma Xiaowei:\n\u3000\u3000At present, the epidemic situation is severe and complex, and it is in a critical period of prevention and control.\u00a0From the scope of transmission, there are local outbreaks in Wuhan and multiple outbreaks across the country.\u00a0In addition to Tibet, confirmed cases and suspected cases have been reported in 30 provinces across the country. Cases have been found in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan in China, and cases have also been found in some neighboring countries.\u00a0From the perspective of transmission characteristics, some patients have low or normal early body temperature, more mild cases, and recessive infection.\u00a0At present, the infectivity of the virus is increasing, and the \u201cwalking source of infection\u201d has greatly increased the difficulty of prevention and control.\u00a0Judging from the epidemic situation, the main route is respiratory transmission. Our knowledge of the new coronavirus is still very limited, the source of infection has not been found, the mechanism of transmission and the mutation of the virus are unclear.\u00a0As a new infectious disease, the possibility of the virus changing over a period of time may not be ruled out. There may be some new situations appearing, and the degree of harm of the virus to people of different ages is also changing.\u00a0We have experience in combating SARS. The SARS epidemic took three to four months to pass. The pneumonia epidemic of the new coronavirus infection has mild patients. The incubation period is also infectious from observation. The incubation period is about 10 Around one day, the shortest was one day, and the longest was 14 days, which is very different from SARS.\u00a0At present, the rate of development of the epidemic is accelerating. I am afraid that it will continue for some time, and the number of cases may increase.\nWith the adoption of personnel control measures in Wuhan and the general response to public health emergencies at the first level in all provinces, corresponding measures have been taken, and prevention and control efforts will be further strengthened.\u00a0It is expected that within a period of time, the prevention and control measures will gradually take effect and exert their effects.\u00a02020-01-26 17:11:05\n\u3000\u3000Xinhua News Agency:\n\u3000\u3000We have been very concerned about the prevention and control situation in rural areas. Some media worry that a large number of rural people returned from the city before the Spring Festival, which may include some virus carriers, plus the Spring Festival. Visiting relatives and friends during this period is very common, and rural areas also lack experience in combating SARS. There are problems of low awareness of prevention and poor medical protection conditions, which may become a weak link in the current epidemic prevention war.\u00a0As the tide of returning home after the holiday affects the city\u2019s epidemic prevention work, what do you think about it?\u00a0How will we respond?\u00a0Thank you.\u00a02020-01-26 17:12:08\n\u3000\u3000Li Bin:\n\u3000\u3000Let me answer this question.\u00a0First, rural epidemic prevention is one of the current priorities for prevention and control.\u00a0China\u2019s health policy has always adhered to focusing on rural areas and grassroots units, which means that rural health work must be given top priority.\u00a0In the health work, especially in the prevention and control of infectious diseases, we must increase prevention and control efforts.\u00a0At present, rural prevention and control is integrated with urban community prevention and control.\u00a0Just now, Director Ma also emphasized this point in the briefing.\u00a0Further efforts should be made in urban communities to prevent and control them, and in rural areas.\u00a0The main work is to strengthen several aspects:The first is to improve the health consciousness, disease prevention awareness and disease prevention ability of the majority of farmers.\u00a0Strengthen the publicity of epidemic prevention and control knowledge, compile various publicity materials for pneumonitis infected by the new coronavirus, strengthen health education through various forms such as \u201ca letter from the village\u201d, and reduce participation in large-scale gathering activities, especially after symptoms appear. Seek medical attention in a timely manner.\u00a0For the returnees that everyone is paying close attention to, we hope that friends from the media will join us in calling for returnees to improve their awareness of disease prevention and consciously voluntarily conduct medical observations when they return home. Implementation.\nThe second is to carry out tracking and medical observation on returnees and mobile workers, especially those in Wuhan.\u00a0Health reminders and health screening should be implemented for those who enter the local area from Wuhan to find out if they have fever, cough, chest tightness and other uncomfortable symptoms, fill out a health registration card, and be effectively managed by the local township health center and village doctor. Daily screening and daily reporting to strengthen health management.\nThe third is to do a good job in the diagnosis, treatment, tracking and screening of patients and suspected cases.\u00a0Medical institutions at or above the county level should strengthen pre-checking and triage, set up fever clinics, make it easier for patients to seek medical treatment, and provide patients with protective supplies.\u00a0The patient developed respiratory symptoms and went to the township health center for treatment without fever; to the fever clinic for fever.\u00a0Those found to be infected should be sent to designated hospitals in a timely manner, and close medical contacts should be effectively medically isolated.\u00a0At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the control of nosocomial infections in medical institutions at all levels in rural areas and strengthen personnel training.\u00a0Recently, we have increased the training of rural medical and health personnel, and two rounds of prevention and control training have been conducted nationwide.\u00a0The training of technical guides and clinical protection requirements through videos has been trained to the county level, which has significantly improved the service capabilities of primary medical staff.\u00a0At the same time, it is required to implement training at both the grassroots and rural levels, and make sure that the rural network is truly organized. The county-level health and health administrative department guides the personnel of township health centers and village clinics to implement grass-roots screening and medical follow-up, especially in the field. The health management responsibilities of returnees ensure the implementation of various prevention and control measures at the rural grassroots level.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a02020-01-26 17:12:32\n\u3000\u3000People\u2019s Daily:\n\u3000\u3000At present, during the Spring Festival, travel needs are relatively large. What measures have the transportation system taken to prevent and control the epidemic and what measures will be taken to meet the peak of returning to the city? ?\u00a0Thank you.\u00a02020-01-26 17:18:06\n\u3000\u3000Liu Xiaoming: At\n\u3000\u3000present, it is very important for the transportation department to do a good job in the Spring Festival transportation and to prevent and control the epidemic situation.\u00a0Just now I have introduced some work on prevention and control, and I will introduce some work.\u00a0Currently, 30 first-level responses have been initiated in 31 provinces across the country. Only Tibet has adopted a second-level emergency response because there are no cases.\u00a0In response to the problem that Wuhan\u2019s medical care staff and individual patients could not guarantee medical transportation in the early stage, we contacted the Wuhan Transportation Department to communicate with them and instructed them to establish an emergency taxi fleet, which required 310 buses and 4,700 taxis to ensure travel.\u00a0According to the latest statistics at 7 o\u2019clock this morning, the national transportation system has invested 263,500 front-line prevention and control personnel, and set up 6,672 quarantine stations in the service area of \u200b\u200bexpressways and waterways and highway passenger stations.\u00a0In order to ensure the transportation of goods, 4,196 green corridors were opened on the expressway, and 54,700 vehicles for emergency transportation were reserved, including refrigerated trucks and freight transport vehicles, to ensure the needs of emergency transportation.\nJournalists are concerned about the Spring Festival Transport and Epidemic Prevention.\u00a0Judging from the situation during the Spring Festival, because of the epidemic situation, transportation may be an important way to spread pneumonia.\u00a0We have taken some emergency measures, and now we see that the transportation volume of the Spring Festival Transport has decreased.\u00a0Yesterday was the first day, and our statistics decreased by 28.8% over the same period last year.\u00a0Compared with the first day of last year, the first day of this year should normally be slightly larger, but this year\u2019s mobility has indeed decreased: railways have decreased by 41.5%, road transport has decreased by 25%, and civil aviation has decreased by 41.6%.\u00a0Although the mobility has been reduced, Director Ma Xiaowei also mentioned earlier that the epidemic will continue for some time.\u00a0In the next step, according to the needs of the entire economic and social development, production must be resumed, migrant workers must enter the city, workers must return to the factory, and relatives must return. In this process, the transportation department must do a good job of returning to the city during the Spring Festival. And epidemic defense.\nThe first is to further strengthen the ventilation and disinfection of vehicles, and implement the actual operation of temperature detection and observation room. This process must be strictly implemented.\nThe second is to reduce the possibility of spreading the epidemic.\u00a0Including the resumption of the long-distance passenger transport in Beijing, which I introduced just now, because the long-distance passenger space is relatively small, it is postponed.\u00a0For other transportation vehicles with relatively large space, we increase the capacity more. According to the current situation, the passenger flow is decreasing, and the space between people is even greater.\nThe third is to hope that the majority of passengers can strengthen self-protection and cooperate with the transportation department to do a good job of temperature detection and other tasks.\u00a0We have established a registration system for passenger information cards with the Health and Health Commission and local departments. Everyone who takes a plane, train, or long-distance bus must register an information card to protect themselves and others.\nThe fourth is to further strengthen the self-protection of the driver and sales staff.\u00a0On the one hand, the strength and combat effectiveness of the transportation can be maintained, and on the other hand, the passengers are protected.\u00a0One point I would like to tell you again. In some places, in order to protect communities or certain areas, some rigid isolation facilities have been set up. We understand that.\u00a0Deputy Director Li Bin also said just now that it is very important for the community, especially in rural areas, to strengthen their own protection. It is a responsibility to keep the soil. I think this is a good measure.\u00a0However, from the perspective of transportation, I think we should promote the work in accordance with the principle of \u201cone break and three continuations\u201d: \u201cone break\u201d is to firmly block the channel of virus transmission; \u201cthree continuations\u201d means that the road transportation network cannot be interrupted, ensuring the entire society The operation cannot be interrupted, the emergency transport green channel cannot be interrupted, and the necessary mass transportation channels for production and living materials cannot be interrupted.\u00a0Vice Minister Jiang Ping said just now that we must resume production, raw materials must be available to resume production, and the products produced must be shipped out as soon as possible.\u00a0In this regard, I feel that we need to implement the epidemic prevention work in accordance with the principle of \u201cone break, three ceaseless\u201d.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a02020-01-26 17:19:29\n\u3000\u3000Reporter of\nDong-A Ilbo,\u00a0South Korea:\u3000\u3000As far as I know, the situation of clustered disease has emerged. From this situation, is it possible that the epidemic situation has entered the next stage, how to determine the current transmission capacity?\u00a0Is there a mutation in the virus?\u00a0Please be specific.\u00a0Finally, what kind of prevention and control measures will Beijing take in the next stage?\u00a0Thank you.\u00a02020-01-26 17:20:17\n\u3000\u3000Ma Xiaowei:\n\u3000\u3000This question can be answered in two ways. Liu Xiaoming will answer questions about transportation, and Li Bin will answer questions about viruses.\u00a02020-01-26 17:21:05\n\u3000\u3000Liu Xiaoming:\n\u3000\u3000I have introduced the traffic problem just now. There were related reports yesterday evening and this morning because Beijing\u2019s long-distance passenger transportation is temporarily resumed.\u00a0As you know, Beijing is the most developed city in China, and roads, railways, and civil aviation are very developed. In the daily transportation process, except for small passenger cars, the number of daily trips by road transport is about 3-5 million, with a peak The period is 70,000 to 90,000. The number of people traveling by civil aviation is 300,000 or more. The annual traffic of the capital airport is more than 100 million. In addition to the original Nanyuan Airport, the current Daxing International Airport has a basic daily volume. There are more than 300,000 person-times; the majority of those traveling by rail are 500,000-600,000 person-times.\u00a0In order to do a better job in Beijing\u2019s prevention and control work, the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have attached great importance to it and adopted a series of measures. Everyone has noticed that Beijing has issued a corresponding release.\u00a0Judging from the measures currently taken, the demand for passenger traffic has decreased, and the temporary restoration of the highway has not affected much of Beijing. Beijing transportation has maintained a good and smooth travel, and everyone can buy tickets.\u00a0This is the traffic situation.\u00a02020-01-26 17:21:30\n\u3000\u3000Li Bin:\n\u3000\u3000After the outbreak in Beijing, the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government attached great importance to the establishment of a leading group led by the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee and took effective precautionary measures.\u00a0Beijing\u2019s prevention and control measures have good guidance and reference significance for urban prevention and control in the country. The State Council\u2019s joint prevention and control work mechanism has been transmitted to the whole country in ten aspects of Beijing\u2019s prevention and control measures.\u00a0Just now, Director Ma introduced the prevention and control measures across the country. It can be seen that many regions have learned from the practices of Beijing. You can go to the relevant websites of Beijing to learn about the situation.\nRegarding the mutation of the virus, at the last press conference, friends in the media were very concerned, and we have communicated with friends in the media.\u00a0At present, we have been closely monitoring the mutation of the virus, because this issue is really too critical.\u00a0Now our information is consistent with the information given to media friends last time, and no evidence of virus mutation has been found.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a02020-01-26 17:25:52\n\u3000\u3000Ma Xiaowei:\n\u3000\u3000Virus mutation is a matter of great concern to everyone. Today, together with the press conference, Mr. Gao Fu, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, was the host of the successful isolation of a new type of coronavirus. The situation.\u00a02020-01-26 17:26:55\n\u3000\u3000Gao Fu:\n\u3000\u3000Thank you, this reporter friend, everyone is very concerned about this matter. Just now, Director\u00a0Xiao Wei\u00a0introduced the process of virus discovery.\u00a0I am doing virus research. Each virus has its own characteristics. From the perspective of human perception of coronaviruses, coronaviruses will mutate as they spread through the body. This is the previous understanding of other coronaviruses.\u00a0We have been paying close attention to whether the virus will mutate.\u00a0Due to the development of three generations of sequencing technology, we can quickly see its various changes.\u00a0But because coronavirus is different from other viruses, if it is an avian flu virus, it may tell everyone whether it has changed and where it changed.\u00a0From the beginning of the virus to today, no significant changes have been seen in viruses isolated from the environment, viruses previously isolated from humans, and viruses isolated recently.\u00a0This is our current knowledge of new coronaviruses. We are based on the accumulation of previous knowledge and based on the knowledge of the entire coronavirus or virology. No mutation has been found in the virus, because the differences between the viruses are very small, less than 1%, these differences are still being screened, and further monitoring is needed.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a02020-01-26 17:27:25\n\u3000\u3000CNBC reporter:\n\u3000\u3000I would like to ask, how to alleviate the lack of supplies in the first-line hospitals?\u00a0This is especially the case with a large number of confirmed patients.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a02020-01-26 17:27:59\n\u3000\u3000Ma Xiaowei:\n\u3000\u3000In the face of this pneumonia epidemic, the majority of medical staff are fighting at the front line of work day and night, sticking to their posts and forgetting to work. Their work is high-intensity, overloaded, and they are also at risk of infection. We pay tribute to them in the new era of professionalism in health care, dedicated to devotion, and boundless love. \u201d\u00a0At the same time, we are also very anxious and very worried about the lack of medical resources in Wuhan, Hubei Province. The National Health and Health Commission supports and guides local health departments to coordinate the allocation of bed resources. By yesterday evening, the adjustment of medical resources in Wuhan was obvious. Improved, newly opened 2,400 beds. From the military to the local area, more than 2,360 medical staff have arrived in Wuhan. In the next three days, Wuhan may open nearly 5,000 beds.\u00a0The shortage of medical resources and the inability to live in hospitals will ease.\u00a02020-01-26 17:28:46\n\u3000\u3000Wang Jiangping:\n\u3000\u3000I will add a few words to this question. I just said that the most prominent contradiction between supply and demand in Wuhan epidemic area is the problem of protective clothing. There is a great contradiction between demand and capacity. Every day The demand is 100,000 pieces, and the production capacity is only 13,000 pieces per day. Some time ago, we have been using inventory to ensure demand.\u00a0In the next step, we will do everything we can to ensure the needs of the front line. The first is to use the central reserve to mobilize all protective clothing in the central reserve to Wuhan.\u00a0Second, a batch of materials was mobilized from other fraternal provinces and regions. The emergency start today, and more than 10,000 sets of materials were also sent to the surrounding area. 220,000 pieces of international procurement were also on the way.\u00a0The third is to promote this part of the export and solve the problem of convergence with Chinese standards, so that these protective clothing can be used in stages to maximize the effectiveness of limited resources.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a02020-01-26 17:34:38\n\u3000\u3000CGTN reporter of China Central Radio and Television:\n\u3000\u3000We know that the international community is very concerned about the epidemic. What is the cooperation with the international community in the prevention and control of this epidemic?\u00a0Thank you.\u00a02020-01-26 17:37:39\n\u3000\u3000Ma Xiaowei:\n\u3000\u3000After the epidemic, we have conducted full communication and cooperation with the World Health Organization, relevant countries, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan in an open and transparent manner.\u00a0The first is to share the epidemic situation and technical information in a timely manner with the World Health Organization.\u00a0We immediately notified the World Health Organization about the isolation of the new coronavirus and shared the whole gene sequence of the new coronavirus.\u00a0At the same time, we organized in-depth technical exchanges between Chinese experts and experts from the World Health Organization, and invited experts from the World Health Organization to visit Wuhan, Hubei, to further understand the situation, deepen their understanding and awareness of the epidemic situation, work together and respond together.\u00a0At the invitation of WHO, China participated in two meetings of members of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee, briefing the Committee on the situation of the epidemic and taking preventive and control measures.\nThe second is to do a good job of bilateral communication.\u00a0We have always maintained close contacts with the health administrations of Japan, Thailand, South Korea, the United States and other embassies in China, sharing information and intelligence, verifying information on suspected and confirmed cases, and responding to foreign concerns in a timely manner.\u00a0At the same time, we have also strengthened cooperation with Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. In addition to regular information sharing, we also invited Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan experts to Wuhan to conduct on-site inspections and have in-depth exchanges with local medical staff.\u00a0At the request of Hong Kong and Macau, we also provide diagnostic kits for free.\nIn the next step, we must continue to cooperate closely with the World Health Organization and relevant countries and regions, share information in a timely manner, and promptly and transparently report the situation of epidemic prevention and control.\u00a02020-01-26 17:37:57\n\u3000\u3000Xi\nYanchun\u00a0:\u3000\u3000Time, the last question.\u00a02020-01-26 17:39:16\n\u3000\u3000TV TOKYO reporter:\n\u3000\u3000My question is about page 4 of the material released today, which mentioned the strict management of people leaving Wuhan. What measures will the government take to implement such measures? management.\u00a0Please give us more details.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a02020-01-26 17:39:53\n\u3000\u3000Ma Xiaowei:\n\u3000\u3000This question was answered by Li Bin, deputy director of the National Health and Health Commission.\u00a02020-01-26 17:51:49\n\u3000\u3000Li Bin:\n\u3000\u3000This issue was introduced by Director Ma just now when he briefed you. For this part of the staff from Wuhan, effective management should be carried out in accordance with the principles of \u201ctracing people, registering them in the community, community management, visiting people, regulating transfers, and abnormal medical treatment.\u201d .\u00a0The key now is to implement measures to urban communities and rural areas, because urban communities and rural areas are the first line of defense, and practice has proven to be a more effective management tool.\u00a0The government attaches great importance to community management, especially the management of personnel from Wuhan, and has already deployed this work, mainly taking several measures:\nFirst, tracking people.\u00a0Early detection of patients, timely diagnosis, isolation and treatment, county-level medical institutions are required to strengthen pre-examination and triage, set up fever and respiratory clinics to facilitate medical treatment for patients.\nThe second is to effectively manage close contacts.\u00a0After the patients are found, effective management of these close contacts is very important. This is a very effective means and measure for preventing proliferation and spreading. It is necessary to make use of street, rural township grassroots cadres, and rural medical staff, especially village doctors, The role of contracted doctors and preventive health doctors, standardized management of confirmed and suspected cases, and close contacts.\nThe third is to strengthen the control of migrants entering the community.\u00a0Take the community as a network to strengthen health monitoring, check out the current situation, and take targeted prevention and control measures.\u00a0In other words, before the first two measures, the border moved forward further, focusing on tracking the personnel from the place where the epidemic occurred. The personnel from Wuhan were the focus, and the home medical observation was carried out for 14 days.\u00a0During the observation period, the doctors at the basic level will visit the hospital every day for medical management.\nThe fourth is to carry out health education for residents. By issuing announcements, first give health reminders to people from Wuhan, so that everyone can take the initiative to take medical observation measures, and actively contact the medical and health institutions in urban communities and the medical and health institutions at the two levels in rural areas. , Accept these prevention and control measures, and accept effective management.\u00a0Through various publicity channels, health tips and medical guidelines were issued, and the people were scientifically guided to raise awareness, improve their ability, and strengthen their ability to prevent themselves. At the same time, they actively supported the government in effective management and effectively implemented these measures.\nThrough the above measures, give full play to the mobilization ability of the grass-roots organizations, implement grid management, carpet-like tracking, home-to-people.\u00a0Mass prevention and control, communities, streets, families, and individuals form a joint force, with responsibility to everyone and contacts with households, to ensure that various prevention and control measures are effectively implemented without leaving dead ends, and to effectively control the spread and spread of the epidemic.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a02020-01-26 17:53:32\n\u3000\u3000Xi\nYanchun\u00a0:\u3000\u3000I know that media friends still have a lot of concerns. Many issues may require us to respond with practical actions and specific measures.\u00a0We will do our best to live up to the people, and at the same time we will further strengthen the release of information.\u00a0Starting from tomorrow, the National Health and Health Commission will hold a press conference every morning, and Hubei Province and some places with more epidemics will also hold a press conference every day.\nToday, everyone still has a lot of concerns. We also specially invited and arranged for Mr. Gao Fu, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention to continue to accept your questions on the spot after the meeting.\u00a0Take this opportunity to thank the Chinese and foreign media for their hard work in reporting the public opinion and epidemic situation.\u00a0Thanks again to several publishers, and thank you all. Today\u2019s conference is over.\u00a02020-01-26 17:54:45Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "By\u00a0Amanda Rachel BrunettiThe measles outbreak that began in early October 2019 across the Pacific Island region is ongoing. A disease alert issued by Reliefweb and a situation report published by WHO/UNICEF provide recent updates on the countries affected by the outbreak. These updates have been summarized below.Immunization against measles is an effective, well-established method for disease prevention. The herd immunity threshold for measles is 95%, meaning that at least 95% of the population must be vaccinated in order to prevent [further] transmission of the virus. In response to the current outbreak, the Ministries of Health (MoH) of many Pacific countries have implemented strategies to strengthen their health systems, in large part by instituting mass vaccination campaigns. Though public health strategies have successfully reduced the scale of the outbreak, WHO reports the risk of importation of cases across the islands as moderate and recommends close monitoring of inter- and intra-island movement.American Samoa (Population 51,000)No new confirmed cases have been reported since mid-December 2019.An initial public health emergency was declared in response to the measles outbreak in American Samoa mid-November 2019, which was extended on December 8 to last until early February 2020.\u00a0 Immediately following the [secondary] outbreak declaration, a mass vaccination campaign for adults aged 19 years and older was enforced; by December 30 12,152 doses were administered.According to a report published on December 30 by the American Samoa Department of Health, approximately 98% of American Samoan children (12 months-18 years) have received the first dose of MMR and 90% of these children have received the second.Fiji (Population 930,000)All 28 cases of measles, including two new cases, have been confined to the Central Division, where circulation is ongoing but the number of new cases per week has decreased. The most recent confirmed case was a 10 month-old baby who is currently in isolation in their home.An article by the Fijian Broadcasting Corporation reports that the Fiji MoH and National Measles Taskforce have lifted the mass gathering advisory that had been instituted when the outbreak began in November. However, citizens are still advised to take precautions, in particular ensuring vaccination status. Since the outbreak was declared, approximately 459,000 people have been immunized against measles. Current national vaccine coverage is 95.3% in children aged 6 months to 5 years and is 91% in those aged 19 to 39 years.Kiribati (Population 110,000)One new laboratory-confirmed case has been reported since late December. Active case finding is being employed where suspected cases have been reported and investigation is ongoing.A report from the Kiribati Ministry of Health and Medical Services records a 96% national vaccination coverage rate in those aged 12 months to 14 years as of July 2019, although gaps have been identified in routine immunization. The Measles Taskforce has been working since early November to close this gap by addressing the unvaccinated populations.Notably, there is also currently an acute diarrhea and vomiting (ADV)/rotavirus outbreak in Kiribati.Samoa (Population 201,000)The rate of measles cases has declined rapidly since the peak of the outbreak in late November and the situation is stabilizing. Twenty-two new cases and two deaths have been reported since late December.The country suffers from dangerously low immunization rates, which may be partially attributed to an MMR vaccine tragedy that occurred in July 2019. A previous WHO/UNICEF situation report notes that prior to the current outbreak, only 31% of Samoan people were vaccinated against measles.

Prior to 2018, there were only a handful of cases.Lead author, University of Melbourne Professor Deborah Williamson, Deputy Director of the Microbiological Unit Public Health Laboratory at the Doherty Institute said\u00a0Shigella\u00a0is the most infectious of the gastrointestinal pathogens.\u201cJust two or three bacteria can make you really sick, which is why it\u2019s so easily transmitted, particularly in men who have sex with men,\u201d Professor Williamson said.\u201cIn this study, we used whole genome sequencing to show that all of the cases from the past year and a half are highly related to each other, which strongly suggests person-to-person transmission within specific sexual networks.\u201dEnhanced contact tracing, surveillance and improved messaging around sexual contact are recommended public health responses for this extremely drug-resistant\u00a0Shigella.Victoria\u2019s Chief Health Officer Dr Brett Sutton said the increase in drug-resistant\u00a0Shigella\u00a0has been reflected in changes already made to management recommendations from the department.\u201cIt\u2019s of enormous concern that we\u2019re seeing cases of\u00a0Shigella that can\u2019t be treated with tablet medication, but instead require hospitalization,\u201d Dr Sutton said.\u201cAntibiotic treatment should be reserved for priority cases, such as those who are immunosuppressed, those who have severe disease and people who work in high risk settings for onward transmission.\u201cAll suspected cases of Shigellosis should have stool samples sent for culture and antibiotic resistance testing to enable targeted treatment when necessary. As always, it is important to emphasize hygiene and safe sex messages in advice to cases as well as recommending exclusion from work until symptoms cease.\u201dYour email address will not be published.

For example, \u201cThe vaccine is spreading measles\u201d or \u201cVaccine strain causing infections\u201d.These claims were debunked by University of Auckland vaccinologist, Dr. Helen Petousis-Harris who says, it is \u201cnot biologically possible\u201d for the MMR vaccine to cause a measles outbreak.\u201cThe outbreaks in Samoa and Tonga are caused by the D8 strain (genotype) of measles virus,\u201d according to a UN report.The\u00a0D8 strain\u00a0is a\u00a0wild-type measles virus, which are naturally occurring and non-mutated, as opposed to the attenuated, or weakened strains found in vaccines.Instead, the Samoa outbreak is caused by underimmunization. Just a few short months ago, Samoa\u2019s population has a 31 percent vaccination rate. This of course has improved after a recent mass vaccination campaign.Go to Rolecosplay websiteThese are not the only ridiculous things being spread/written about the Samoa measles outbreak.

It\u2019s caused by chronic infection with a parasitic worm, or liver fluke,\u00a0which is found in one of the staple foods \u2013 uncooked fish,\u201d he said from Freemantle, where the national finals were held.One-sixth of infected people develop liver cancer, and in Thailand alone 20,000 people die of this cancer each year.\u201cMy research focuses on \u2018worm spit\u2019, molecules secreted by the parasites that cause cells to multiply faster than they normally would,\u201d Dr Smout said. \u201cThat\u2019s a key factor in the initiation of many cancers, and I\u2019ve been able to isolate a molecule, granulin, that causes excessive cell growth.\u201dBy making worm granulin in the laboratory, Dr Smout has found that it is not just a potent human cell growth stimulator \u2013 it also promotes wound healing. \u00a0For more infectious disease news and information, visit and \u201clike\u201d the Infectious Disease News Facebook page.\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet how this works, but we suspect that as the worm feeds on the liver it also heals the wounds it creates. In the short term this would be beneficial to the human host, but the repeated wounding and healing over decades could lead to this form of cancer, which has a dismal prognosis.\u201d\u201cOur work on this project is two-fold,\u201d he said. \u201cFirstly we aim to develop treatments or a vaccine to prevent liver fluke infection, which in turn will dramatically reduce the incidence of liver cancer in Thailand and surrounding countries.\u201cSecondly we believe that an in-depth understanding of liver fluke biology, particularly focusing on how it heals the wounds it creates, could lead to new treatments for non-healing wounds which are an increasing problem with smokers, diabetics and an aging population.\u201dDr Smout will be packing up his props and heading to the UK in June to represent Australia at the International FameLab competition, held at the Times Cheltenham Science Festival.Opisthorchis\u00a0species are liver fluke parasites (trematodes or worms).\u00a0Opisthorchis viverrini\u00a0is known as the Southeast Asian liver fluke and\u00a0O. felineus\u00a0as the cat liver fluke, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Most infected persons have no symptoms. In mild cases, symptoms may include indigestion, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation. With infections of longer duration, an enlarged liver and malnutrition may occur. In rare cases, inflammation of the gall bladder and ducts, and cancer of these structures may develop.Infection is caused by eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish containing the larvae. Lightly salted, smoked, or pickled fish may contain infectious organisms.\u00a0O. viverrini\u00a0is found mainly in northeast Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia.Your email address will not be published.

It causes fever and severe\u00a0joint pain.Other symptoms\u00a0include\u00a0muscle\u00a0pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash.The disease shares some clinical signs with dengue, and can be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common.There is no cure for the disease.\u00a0Treatment\u00a0is focused on relieving the\u00a0symptoms.The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya.\u00a0For more infectious disease news and information,\u00a0visit and \u201clike\u201d the Infectious Disease News Facebook page.The disease occurs in Africa, Asia and the Indian subcontinent. In recent decades mosquito vectors of chikungunya have spread to Europe and the\u00a0Americas. In 2007, disease transmission was reported\u00a0for the first time\u00a0in Europe, in a localized outbreak in north-eastern Italy.\u00a0The first autochthonous chikungunya cases in the Western hemisphere were reported on the French side of St. Martin last December. There is currently greater than 63,000 cases reported in the Caribbean and South America.The CDC notes there is currently no vaccine or medicine to prevent chikungunya.

            "content": "PRESS RELEASEQueensland\u2019s Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young has recently received an e-petition from almost 500 concerned citizens asking her to publicly denounce the Australian Vaccination Sceptics Network (AVSN) and their participation in a healthy lifestyle expo on the Sunshine Coast.Dr Young said she has always shown unwavering support for vaccinations and is very supportive of any positive messages encouraging parents to vaccinate.\u201cIt is my understanding that the Sunshine Coast Public Health Unit told the organisers months ago that Queensland Health would not be participating in any vaccination debates.\u201cLike every state of Australia we are very pro-vaccination and will continue to disseminate positive messages about the benefits of vaccination,\u201d Dr Young said.\u201cThe bottom line is that most people accept vaccination as a vital component of protecting their child from preventable disease.\u201cAs a society we have an obligation to protect our children. If you are not vaccinating your child you are potentially not only harming them, but also children who can\u2019t be vaccinated \u2013 like kids with cancer and babies less than six months old.\u201cThere are some very small, but vocal groups like the AVSN who insist on spreading misinformation and debunked theories.\u201cWhile I wholeheartedly disagree with them, legally I am in no position to restrict their movements in this state.\u201cThis is not a debate about \u2018free speech\u2019; it\u2019s about the fact that there\u2019s a small percentage of people who are under the misconception that there are two sides to this story, because there simply isn\u2019t.\u201cI am on the record saying most parents do the right thing and vaccinate their children. The majority of Queensland regions have 90% or more of their children vaccinated across all age groups.\u201cWe will continue our work on some of the areas that could be higher.\u201cWe do not believe that attending an expo and being some sort of drawcard with \u2018debate\u2019 between the AVSN and Queensland Health is going to help our cause.\u201cIf event organisers of health expos practiced due diligence, they would not invite groups such as AVSN to participate because that organisation is not \u2018healthy\u2019 at all.\u201cAnyone with concerns about the presence of the AVSN should direct them to the event organisers,\u201d she said.Your email address will not be published.

It can affect anyone, although it is more common in people who live in tropical areas with poor sanitary conditions.\u00a0For more infectious disease news and information, visit and \u201clike\u201d the Infectious Disease News Facebook page.People mostly get infected with the parasite from ingestion of fecally contaminated food and water containing the amebic cysts. Transmission can also occur through oral-anal contact with a chronically ill or asymptomatic carrier.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only about 10% to 20% of people who are infected with\u00a0E. histolytica\u00a0become sick from the infection. Of those who do become sick,\u00a0symptoms may include\u00a0stomach pain, bloody stools (poop), and fever. Rarely,\u00a0E. histolytica\u00a0invades the liver and forms an abscess (a collection of pus). In a small number of instances, it has been shown to spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs or brain, but this is very uncommon.Your email address will not be published.

            "content": "The Northern Sydney Public Health Unit is reporting an increase in the number of cases of Salmonella\u00a0among toddlers and young children on the Northern Beaches and warn parents that bandicoot droppings may be the source of the infection.Northern Sydney Local Health District\u2019s Director Public Health, Dr Michael Staff said the outbreak strain,\u00a0 Salmonella Java,\u00a0can be caused by accidentally ingesting material containing the bacterium. In the past few years young children on the Northern Beaches have been diagnosed with the condition after ingesting sand from public parks and child care centres.He said testing and removal of the effected sand from play areas had controlled, but not eliminated, cases of the illness in recent years. \u00a0Dr Staff said cases of Salmonella Java began appearing again in February, following several months when no cases had been reported.\u201cSo far this year we\u2019ve had 19 cases confirmed and while some have been traced to play area sand, it appears that many children may have been infected by contact with bandicoot droppings,\u201d he said.\u00a0For more infectious disease news and information, visit and \u201clike\u201d the Infectious Disease News Facebook page.The vast majority of parents with sick children this year had reported increased bandicoot activity in their backyards: \u201cThey\u2019ve reported conical holes in their lawns, which is a sure sign of bandicoot activity,\u201d Dr Staff said.The Northern Sydney Public Health Unit had inspected the backyards of several cases and bandicoot droppings collected at one property had tested positive for the Salmonella Java, Dr Staff added.He believes children may be coming into indirect contact with bandicoot droppings while playing in their backyards. \u201cYoung children tend to put their fingers in their mouths a lot and this could transfer the bacterium to\nthem if they have touched a contaminated surface.\u201dOften confused with rodents, bandicoots are small, omnivorous marsupials. They\u00a0are about the size of a rabbit, and have a pointy snout\u00a0, humped back, thin tail and large hind feet.\u00a0There are around 20 species of bandicoots, three of which are found in NSW.Early signs of Salmonella Java poisoning include fever, nausea, vomiting, stomach pains and diarrhea.To prevent further spread of the illness, the Public Health Unit recommended parents of young children cleared animal droppings from areas where their children played, discouraged children from putting their hands or toys in their mouth when playing outside, and make sure their children washed their hands after playing outside.Chicken wire mesh at least 50cm high and 15cm would stop bandicoots entering backyards.Your email address will not be published.
