Show more\nAuthor Notes\nNational Science Review, nwaa036, https://doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036\nPublished:\n\n03 March 2020\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 epidemic started in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since impacted a large portion of China and raised major global concern. Herein, we investigated the extent of molecular divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses. Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated. Our results suggest that the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike seen in SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs are likely caused by mutations and natural selection besides recombination.\n\nPopulation genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date. Although the L type (\u223c70%) is more prevalent than the S type (\u223c30%), the S type was found to be the ancestral version. \n\nWhereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020. Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly.\n\nOn the other hand, the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure.\n\nThese findings strongly support an urgent need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and chart records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/nsr/advance...searchresult=1",

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "\u00abWith our actions we influence\nthe life and death of many people\u00bb With a long post on Facebook, Dr. Daniele Macchini, a doctor from Humanitas Gavazzeni, talks about his life on the front lines to combat coronavirus. It is a creepy testimony, to be read from the first to the last line.\nHere is the post\n\nIn one of the constant emails that I receive from my health management on a more than daily basis now these days, there was also a paragraph entitled \"doing social responsibly\", with some recommendations that can only be supported. After thinking for a long time if and what to write about what is happening to us, I felt that the silence was not at all responsible. I will therefore try to convey to people \"not involved in the work\" and more distant from our reality, what we are experiencing in Bergamo during these pandemic days from Covid-19. I understand the need not to panic,\n\nI also understand the economic damage and I am also worried about that. After the epidemic, the tragedy will start again. However, apart from the fact that we are literally also devastating our NHS from an economic point of view, I allow myself to raise the importance of the health damage that is likely throughout the country and I find it nothing short of \"chilling\" for example that a red zone already requested by the region has not yet been established for the municipalities of Alzano Lombardo and Nembro (I would like to clarify that this is pure personal opinion).\n\nI myself looked with some amazement at the reorganizations of the entire hospital in the previous week, when our current enemy was still in the shadows: the wards slowly \"emptied\", the elective activities interrupted, the intensive therapies freed to create as many beds as possible. Containers arriving in front of the emergency room to create diversified routes and avoid any infections. All this rapid transformation brought in the corridors of the hospital an atmosphere of surreal silence and emptiness that we still did not understand, waiting for a war that had yet to begin and that many (including me) were not so sure would never come with such ferocity . (I open a parenthesis: all this in silence and without publicity,\n\nI still remember my night guard a week ago passed unnecessarily without turning a blind eye, waiting for a call from the microbiology of the Sack. I was waiting for the outcome of a swab on the first suspect patient in our hospital, thinking about what consequences it would have for us and the clinic. If I think about it, my agitation for one possible case seems almost ridiculous and unjustified, now that I have seen what is happening.\n\nWell, the situation is now nothing short of dramatic. No other words come to mind. The war has literally exploded and the battles are uninterrupted day and night. One after the other the unfortunate poor people come to the emergency room. They have far from the complications of a flu. Let's stop saying it's a bad flu. In these 2 years I have learned that the people of Bergamo do not come to the emergency room at all. They did well this time too. They followed all the indications given: a week or ten days at home with a fever without going out and risking contagion, but now they can't take it anymore. They don't breathe enough, they need oxygen.\n\nDrug therapies for this virus are few. The course mainly depends on our organism. We can only support it when it can't take it anymore. It is mainly hoped that our body will eradicate the virus on its own, let's face it. Antiviral therapies are experimental on this virus and we learn its behavior day after day. Staying at home until the symptoms worsen does not change the prognosis of the disease.\n\nNow, however, that need for beds in all its drama has arrived. One after another, the departments that had been emptied are filling up at an impressive rate. The display boards with the names of the sick, of different colors depending on the operating unit they belong to, are now all red and instead of the surgical operation there is the diagnosis, which is always the same cursed: bilateral interstitial pneumonia.\n\nNow, tell me which flu virus causes such a rapid tragedy. Because that's the difference (now I'm going down a bit in the technical field): in the classical flu, apart from infecting much less population over several months, cases can be complicated less frequently, only when the VIRUS destroying the protective barriers of the Our respiratory tract allows BACTERIA normally resident in the upper tract to invade the bronchi and lungs, causing more serious cases. Covid 19 causes a banal influence in many young people, but in many elderly people (and not only) a real SARS because it arrives directly in the alveoli of the lungs and infects them making them unable to perform their function.\n\nSorry, but to me as a doctor it doesn't reassure you that the most serious are mainly elderly people with other pathologies. The elderly population is the most represented in our country and it is difficult to find someone who, above 65 years of age, does not take at least the tablet for pressure or diabetes. I also assure you that when you see young people who end up in intubated intensive care, pronated or worse in ECMO (a machine for the worst cases, which extracts the blood, re-oxygenates it and returns it to the body, waiting for the organism, hopefully, heal your lungs), all this tranquility for your young age passes.\n\nAnd while there are still people on social networks who pride themselves on not being afraid by ignoring the indications, protesting that their normal lifestyle habits are \"temporarily\" in crisis, the epidemiological disaster is taking place. And there are no more surgeons, urologists, orthopedists, we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us. The cases multiply, we arrive at the rate of 15-20 hospitalizations a day all for the same reason. The results of the swabs now come one after the other: positive, positive, positive. Suddenly the emergency room is collapsing.\n\nEmergency provisions are issued: help is needed in the emergency room. A quick meeting to learn how the first aid management software works and a few minutes later they are already downstairs, next to the warriors on the war front. The screen of the PC with the reasons for the access is always the same: fever and respiratory difficulty, fever and cough, respiratory insufficiency etc ... Exams, radiology always with the same sentence: bilateral interstitial pneumonia, bilateral interstitial pneumonia, bilateral interstitial pneumonia. All to be hospitalized. Someone already to intubate and go to intensive care. For others it is late ...\n\nIntensive care becomes saturated, and where intensive care ends, more are created. Each fan becomes like gold: those of the operating rooms that have now suspended their non-urgent activity become places for intensive care that did not exist before. I found it incredible, or at least I can speak for Humanitas Gavazzeni (where I work) how it was possible to put in place in such a short time a deployment and a reorganization of resources so finely designed to prepare for a disaster of this magnitude. And every reorganization of beds, wards, staff, work shifts and tasks is constantly reviewed day after day to try to give everything and even more.\n\nThose wards that previously looked like ghosts are now saturated, ready to try to give their best for the sick, but exhausted. The staff is exhausted. I saw fatigue on faces that didn't know what it was despite the already grueling workloads they had. I have seen people still stop beyond the times they used to stop already, for overtime that was now habitual. I saw solidarity from all of us, who never failed to go to our internist colleagues to ask \"what can I do for you now?\" or \"leave that hospitalization alone.\" Doctors who move beds and transfer patients, who administer therapies instead of nurses. Nurses with tears in their eyes because we are unable to save everyone and the vital signs of several patients at the same time reveal an already marked destiny.\n\nThere are no more shifts, schedules. Social life is suspended for us. I have been separated for a few months, and I assure you that I have always done everything possible to constantly see my son even on the days of taking the night off, without sleeping and postponing sleep until when I am without him, but for almost 2 weeks I have not voluntarily I see neither my son nor my family members for fear of infecting them and in turn infecting an elderly grandmother or relatives with other health problems. I am satisfied with some photos of my son that I regard between tears and a few video calls.\n\nSo have patience, too, that you cannot go to the theater, museums or gym. Try to have mercy on that myriad of older people you could exterminate. It is not your fault, I know, but of those who put it in your head that you are exaggerating and even this testimony may seem like an exaggeration for those who are far from the epidemic, but please, listen to us, try to leave the house only to indispensable things. Do not go en masse to stock up in supermarkets: it is the worst thing because you concentrate and the risk of contacts with infected people who do not know they are higher. You can go there as you usually do. Maybe if you have a normal mask (even those that are used to do certain manual work) put it on. Don't look for ffp2 or ffp3. Those should serve us and we are beginning to struggle to find them. By now we have had to optimize their use only in certain circumstances, as recently suggested by WHO in view of their almost ubiquitous impoverishment.\n\nOh yes, thanks to the shortage of certain devices, I and many other colleagues are certainly exposed despite all the means of protection we have. Some of us have already become infected despite the protocols. Some infected colleagues have in turn infected family members and some of their family members already struggle between life and death. We are where your fears could make you stay away. Try to make sure you stay away. Tell your elderly or other family members to stay indoors. Bring him the groceries please.\n\nWe have no alternative. It's our job. Indeed what I do these days is not really the job I'm used to, but I do it anyway and I will like it as long as it responds to the same principles: try to make some sick people feel better and heal, or even just alleviate the suffering and the pain to those who unfortunately cannot heal.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't spend many words about the people who define us heroes these days and who until yesterday were ready to insult and report us. Both will return to insult and report as soon as everything is over. People forget everything quickly. And we're not even heroes these days. It's our job. We risked something bad every day before: when we put our hands in a belly full of someone's blood we don't even know if he has HIV or hepatitis C; when we do it even though we know it has HIV or hepatitis C; when we sting with the one with HIV and take the drugs that make us vomit from morning to night for a month. When we open with the usual anguish the results of the tests at the various checks after an accidental puncture hoping not to be infected. We simply earn our living with something that gives us emotions. It doesn't matter if they are beautiful or ugly, just take them home.\n\nIn the end we only try to make ourselves useful for everyone. Now try to do it too though: with our actions we influence the life and death of a few dozen people. You with yours, many more. Please share and share the message. We must spread the word to prevent what is happening here in Italy.\n\nhttps://www.ecodibergamo.it/stories/...ne_1344030_11/",

The fact that this disease has caused illness, including illness resulting in death, and sustained person-to-person spread in China is concerning. These factors meet two of the criteria of a pandemic. It\u2019s unclear how the situation will unfold, but risk is dependent on exposure. At this time, some people will have an increased risk of infection, for example healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 and other close contacts of patients with COVID-19. For the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low at this time.\" link \n\n\n1) The CDC is seeing what we see globally and it looks bad. For instance, look at South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy. Exponential growth.\n\n2) There is no sustained human to human transmission in the U.S. at this minute. No one knows how many people are actually infected in the U.S. It appears there are not a lot of people hospitalized who are ill with an unknown pneumonia. Some states like Florida will not release the stats on how many suspected cases they are testing. It seems we will know only when there is already a confirmed case who may, or may not, have wandered around for two weeks while mildly sick.\n\n3) The CDC knows that pandemic modelling shows at least as many people die from collateral damage as from the disease itself. That is - people who are ill with another disease and can not get treatment in a pandemic situation - and violence. TPTB are terrified of pan ic. All of us can see the videos of a $50.00 off sale on televisions during the holidays. Complete pandemonium. So government officials want to warn people but not send them into a pan ic.\n\nFor me - I read the first sentence and that is really what they are saying. The last sentence is not pertinent. We do not know who is exposed to the virus until after an infection is discovered.",

Gen. (Dr.) Paul Friedrichs, the Joint Staff surgeon, and Robert G. Salesses, deputy assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense integration stressed the department is still laser-focused on three aspects: protecting service members and their families, ensuring crucial DOD missions continue and supporting the whole of government approach to the situation.\n\n\nDOD is supporting the situation with the ocean liner Grand Princess docking on Oakland, California, with several people aboard having contracted the virus. DOD will provide four bases \u2014 Travis Air Force Base, California, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas; Miramar Marine Corps Air Station, California and  Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Georgia \u2014 that will allow the Department of Health and Human Affairs to quarantine the passengers for 14 days, Salesses said.\n\nFriedrichs said that right now the \"the immediate risk to our force remains low.\"\n\nThere have been a handful of cases in DOD around the world. \"No one is seriously ill at this point and everyone has been diagnosed is being appropriately treated, getting the care that they need,\" the doctor said. \"So we have implemented a number of measures in order to make sure that people are appropriately identified and treated.\"\n\n\nAs of this morning, there are seven people that officials suspect may have the virus and they are in the process of being tested. There are two more active duty personnel who are presumptive positives, Friedrichs said. This occurs when the first test is positive and officials are waiting for the results of a second test. Finally, there is an active duty service member in Korea who is unquestionably positive.\n\nFrom the medical standpoint, the really important discussion now is to stress the appropriate mitigation measures to reduce the risk of more people becoming infected, the doctor said.\n\nKeeping distance between people, wiping down workspaces, covering mouths when coughing or sneezing, \"these are all the things that my mom told me years and years and years ago,\" Friedrichs said. \"She's 84, she still tells me those now if I fail to remember them.\"\n\n\nThe doctor said the common sense aspect of this mitigation is probably the most important aspect of the situation now. \"These basic, unexciting, non-technical measures have significant impact on how rapidly this spreads,\" he said.\n\nThe military is aggressively getting the word out about these measures. Defense Secretary Dr. Mark T. Esper took this to heart by having his regular senior leader meeting done via video-teleconference this morning rather than having everyone in one room, Jonathon Rath Hoffman, special assistant to the defense secretary for public affairs, said.\n\nDOD will continue to do updates and will continue to issue guidance as more is known about the outbreak. \"There have been questions on why do we keep putting more guidance out? I want to be very clear as a doc, it's because as we learn more, and as we see where the outbreaks are, we're trying to tailor it to give the best advice that we can to commanders and service members and their families,\" Friedrichs said.\nhttps://www.defense.gov/Explore/News...tion-guidance/",

Wynia and John L. Hick\nMarch 10, 2020    \n\nThe emergence of a new infectious disease that rapidly spreads around the world, like Covid-19, makes disaster planning experts move into overdrive. Lessons learned over the last decade can help cope with the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nIn the spring of 2009, a new type of flu virus, called H1N1, was detected in the United States. It spread across the U.S and to other countries. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that, in the U.S. alone, between April 2009 and April 2010 H1N1 sickened more than 60 million people, caused 275,000 hospitalizations, and killed more than 12,000 people.\n\nIn the midst of a summer lull in H1N1 cases, the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) convened a committee to come up with guidance for clinicians and hospital administrators who might need to make difficult choices during this \u2014 and future \u2014 overwhelming pandemics.\n\nChoices like these: If there aren\u2019t enough masks or ventilation machines available, what is an ethically defensible way to allocate them? Might it be ethically acceptable to remove one patient from a ventilator so another could use it? Should clinicians who are forced to make such choices be legally protected? And who should get priority access to vaccines if they become available?...",

Chief Medical Officer for England Professor Chris Whitty, has shared a statement. If more cases are confirmed in the UK, it will be announced as soon as possible by the Chief Medical Officer of the affected country.\n\nBased on the World Health Organization\u2019s declaration that this is a public health emergency of international concern, the UK Chief Medical Officers have raised the risk to the public from low to moderate. This permits the government to plan for all eventualities. The risk to individuals remains low.\n\nBased on the scientific advice of SAGE the UK Chief Medical Officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and is experiencing cough or fever or shortness of breath, to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild.\n\nThese areas have been identified because of the volume of air travel from affected areas, understanding of other travel routes and number of reported cases. This list will be kept under review. Our advice for travellers from Wuhan and Hubei Province remains unchanged from the below.\n\nThe Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, has announced strengthened legal powers to bolster public health protections against coronavirus. The regulations have been put in place to reduce the risk of further human-to-human transmission in this country by keeping individuals in isolation where public health professionals believe there is a reasonable risk an individual may have the virus.\n\nAs of 10 February, a total of 1,114 people have been tested, of which 1,106 were confirmed negative and 8 positive.\n\nWe have been working in close collaboration with international colleagues and the World Health Organization to monitor the situation in China and around the world.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care will be publishing updated data on this page on a daily basis at 2pm until further notice. Information about the virus\n\n\nA coronavirus is a type of virus. As a group, coronaviruses are common across the world. Typical symptoms of coronavirus include fever and a cough that may progress to a severe pneumonia causing shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.\n\nGenerally, coronavirus can cause more severe symptoms in people with weakened immune systems, older people, and those with long-term conditions like diabetes, cancer and chronic lung disease.\n\nNovel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified in Wuhan City, China. Advice for travellers\n\n\nBritish people travelling and living overseas following the outbreak of novel coronavirus should check the Foreign and Commonwealth Office travel advice.\n\nThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised UK nationals to leave China where possible. If the situation continues to escalate the pressure on the Chinese health system may intensify, and it may also become harder for people to travel.\n\nThis change does not affect our advice for those returning from Wuhan or mainland China. Travellers from Wuhan and Hubei Province\n\n\nIf you have travelled from Wuhan or Hubei Province to the UK in the last 14 days you should immediately:stay indoors and avoid contact with other people as you would with the flu\ncall NHS 111 to inform them of your recent travel to the area\n\nIn Scotland phone your GP or NHS 24 on 111 out of hours. If you are in Northern Ireland, call 0300 200 7885.\n\nPlease follow this advice even if you do not have symptoms of the virus. Travellers from other parts of China and other specified areas\n\n\nThis advice applies to travellers who have returned to the UK from the following areas:China\nThailand\nJapan\nRepublic of Korea\nHong Kong\nTaiwan\nSingapore\nMalaysia\nMacau\n\nIf you have returned to the UK from any of these areas in the last 14 days and develop symptoms of cough or fever or shortness of breath, you should immediately:stay indoors and avoid contact with other people as you would with the flu\ncall NHS 111 to inform them of your recent travel to the country\n\nIn Scotland phone your GP or NHS 24 on 111 out of hours. If you are in Northern Ireland, call 0300 200 7885.\n\nPlease follow this advice even if your symptoms are minor. What this means in practice\n\n\nWe are asking people to take simple, common-sense steps to avoid close contact with other people as much as possible, like they would with other flu viruses.\n\nThis means remaining at home for 14 days after arriving from Wuhan or Hubei Province (or elsewhere in China if you have symptoms) and not going to work, school or public areas.\n\nWhere possible, you should avoid having visitors to your home, but it\u2019s ok for friends, family or delivery drivers to drop off food. Transport\n\n\nYou should not use public transport or taxis until 14 days after your return from Wuhan or Hubei Province (or elsewhere in China if you have symptoms). Getting food and medicine\n\n\nWe recommend that you stay at home for 14 days after arriving from Wuhan or Hubei Province (or elsewhere in China if you have symptoms), and avoid public places. Where possible, contact a friend, family member or delivery services to carry out errands on your behalf. Taking children to school\n\n\nWe recommend that you stay at home for 14 days after arriving from Wuhan or Hubei Province (or elsewhere in China if you have symptoms), and avoid public places. Where possible, contact a friend or family member to take your children to school. Why the advice has changed\n\n\nThis is an evolving situation and the advice has changed based on emerging information from China about the number of cases and spread of the infection from person to person.\n\nThis is a highly precautionary measure to limit the potential spread of infection. Summary of action taken\n\n\nWe have introduced advanced monitoring at airports with direct flights from China.\n\nA team of public health experts has been established in Heathrow to support anyone travelling in from China who feels unwell. These hubs will bring in rotational teams of 7 clinicians, working in shifts, who will be on hand to support patients on arrival. This is in addition to medical staff who are already permanently in place at all UK airports and the advice issued to all UK airports for people travelling to and from China.\n\nThe government has issued clinical guidance for the detection and diagnosis of novel coronavirus (2019-nCov), and infection prevention and control.\n\nThe Chief Medical Officer, Medical Director at PHE and Medical Director at NHSE/I have issued advice via a CAS (Central Alerting System) alert to frontline staff to increase awareness of the situation and any actions to take.\n\nMost people who develop symptoms will get them after leaving the airport and so the priority is providing UK residents and travellers with the latest information to make sure they know what to do if they experience symptoms, and the NHS and PHE have an established plan to respond to someone who becomes unwell.\n\nChina has also introduced port-of-exit screening so people already exhibiting symptoms are not allowed to leave the country. Diagnosis and analysis\n\n\nBased on current evidence, novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) presents with flu-like symptoms including a fever, a cough, or difficulty breathing. The current evidence is that most cases appear to be mild. Those who have died in Wuhan appear to have had pre-existing health conditions.\n\nThe UK is now one of the first countries outside China to have a prototype specific laboratory test for this new disease. Healthcare professionals who are contacted by a patient with symptoms following travel to Wuhan have been advised to submit samples to PHE for testing. Individuals should be treated in isolation\n\nAfter the experience of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, PHE developed a series of diagnostic tests to detect any member of the family of coronaviruses. These have been used for several years, and were able to detect the first UK case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012.\n\nWith the first reported publication of the genome sequence of a 2019 novel coronavirus, PHE was able to rapidly develop further specific tests for this virus, working with WHO and global network of laboratories.\n\nWhen a clinician suspects novel coronavirus (2019-nCov), they take samples from the nose, throat and deeper respiratory samples, package and send them safely to PHE Colindale. PHE can provide a laboratory result from this specific virus on the same working day.\n\nPHE also has the capability to sequence the viral genome and compare this to published sequences from China, if a case occurs. This will provide valuable information on any mutations in the virus over time and allow an improved understanding of how it spreads.

South Korea has reported one of the highest number of infections outside China.\n\nThis has come as a blow to South Korean firms, which are the biggest foreign investors in Vietnam.

These new measures will include cessation of 14-day quarantines.\n\n\nThe following recommendations are effective immediately, and will extend through March 31, 2020:Quarantine: With the shift from containment to mitigation, it is no longer necessary for someone who has been in contact with someone with COVID-19 to quarantine for 14 days. This applies to the general public, as well as health care workers and first responders. However, if they develop respiratory symptoms, they should stay home in order to protect those who are well.\nSick Persons:People should stay home if they are sick.\nThose with cold-like symptoms who can manage their symptoms at home with over-the-counter drugs should do so, regardless of whether they have a cold, the flu, or COVID-19.If, however, difficulty breathing and lethargy develops, or symptoms were better and then got worse, they should call their healthcare provider, or urgent care center ahead so they can prepare to take care of them.\nPeople should only call 911 or go to an emergency department if they believe that they are extremely sick or their life is in imminent danger. Other emergencies are still occurring, and emergency resources must be available to address all of them, not just COVID-19\n\n\nVulnerable Populations: People at higher risk should consider staying home and away from crowded social gatherings where people are within arm\u2019s length, such as parades, conferences, sporting events and concerts.Age: Risk of severe disease from COVID-19 escalates as age increases. Persons over age 80 are in the highest risk category.\nUnderlying Conditions: People with chronic health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, heart disease, or lung diseases such as COPD, as well as those with severely weakened immune systems are at high risk of complications.\n\nWorkplaces: Workplaces and businesses may consider implementing telecommuting and teleconferencing for their employees, where appropriate and feasible.\nSchools: Schools that have a COVID-19 exposure or case should be in close collaboration with the local health department and County Office of Education regarding appropriate next steps.\nMasks: Follow CDC\u2019s recommendations for using a facemask.CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.\nFacemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a healthcare facility).\n\n\n\nCurrently, laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Sacramento County stand at 10 people with one recovered, including an elementary school-aged student in Elk Grove, whose test came back positive today. \n\nFor more information about COVID-19, please visit Sacramento County\u2019s COVID-19 webpage.

Over the weekend, Italian officials had announced a lockdown for Lombardy region and 14 provinces in other regions.\nWHO carefully weighs pandemic messaging  At a media briefing today, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said it's troubling that so many countries have been affected so quickly by the novel coronavirus. In stopping just short of calling the epidemic a pandemic, Tedros said the experience of China and other countries show that the virus can be controlled.\n  He said the WHO has consolidated guidance for four different scenarios. For countries that have no cases, sporadic cases, or limited clusters of cases, the WHO recommends finding each case, then treating and isolating sick people. Tedros said the WHO acknowledges, however, that for countries with community transmission, contact tracing is more challenging. He said those countries should focusing on managing clusters and consider measures such as canceling school or mass gatherings.\n  \"The rule of the game is to never give up,\" he said.\n  Mike Ryan, MD, said that, unlike for flu, the WHO doesn't have any criteria for a coronavirus pandemic. And though the WHO isn't afraid of using the word \"pandemic,\" he said officials worry about the global community's reaction to it; that some might be resigned to the virus getting the upper hand. \"Some countries have had real success in turning the disease around,\" he said.\n  The world is very much in the beginning or the middle of the COVID-19 epidemic, Ryan said. \"It's in the hands of us in society. There's a lot we can do to slow it down.\"\nItaly lockdown comes amid case surge  In announcing measures that take effect tomorrow, Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told the country in a televised address that travel will be permitted only for work or family emergencies, the BBC reported. He said the quarantine also includes a ban on public gatherings, including sporting events.\n  The health ministry today reported 1,797 cases, up from 1,492 new infections reported the day before, raising its overall total to 9,172. The country also reported 97 more deaths, lifting its fatality count to 463. The lockdown involving Lombardy, the hardest-hit province, and nearby regions had put about 16 million people in quarantine.\n  At today's briefing, Ryan said the measures may not do much to help the situation in the crisis zone, but they may help decrease the threat to other parts of Italy, giving officials more time to prepare. He said when China took a similar step in Wuhan, it helped ensure that the country wasn't battling other outbreaks on the scale of Wuhan's.\n  Ryan was careful to say that the step was reasonable but isn't a guarantee that Italy's other regions won't be faced with similar battles ahead.\n  Italy has the second-most COVID-19 cases in the world, behind China. On Feb 23\u2014just 15 days ago\u2014the nation had only 132 cases.\n  Elsewhere in Europe, Germany reported 237 new cases today, raising its total to 1,139, according to totals from the Robert Koch Institute. The country has reported two deaths. The hardest-hit states are North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Wurttemberg.\n  And Spain's capital of Madrid over the past 2 days reported 469 more cases, boosting the country's total to 1,050, Anadolu Agency news reported today, citing the country's health ministry. Health officials have called an emergency meeting, given an epidemic growth rate that is similar to Italy's. France also recently crossed the 1,000-case mark.\n  Albania reported its first two cases, in a man and his son who had traveled to Italy, Agence France-Presse reported.\nCases rise in Iran, other Mideast countries  In Iran, one of the world's other hot spots, the health ministry today reported 595 new cases and 43 new deaths, raising its respective total to 7,161 cases, 237 of them fatal.\n  The country has temporarily released 70,000 prisoners from jail to battle the spread of the virus in the facilities, Reuters reported today. Judiciary officials said the prisoner release will continue to the point where it doesn't create security problems, and they didn't specify when the released people would return to jail.\n  In a related developments, officials are worried about the risk of spread during Nowuz, the Iranian New Year, which begins on Mar 20, a holiday associated with family and vacation travel. Despite travel warnings and restrictions, officials have seen heavy traffic on roads headed to vacation area on the Caspian Sea.\n  Elsewhere, Qatar today announced that all schools and universities will close to reduce the spread of the virus, Al Jazeera reported. The closure begins on Mar 10 and is in effected until further notice. Yesterday, Qatar announced a temporary ban on travelers from 14 countries, including 6 in the Middle East. Qatar has reported 18 cases, according the latest numbers from the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean regional office (EMRO).\n  Today on Twitter, WHO's EMRO said it has deployed teams to Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait to support their COVID-19 responses. Behind Iran, Bahrain (109), Iraq (61), and Kuwait (65) have the most cases in the region.\nSouth Korea cases show downward trend  The number of newly reported cases in South Korea declined for a third day in a row, with 248 new cases today, raising its total to 7,382. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reported 1 more death, putting the country's fatality count at 51.\n  Elsewhere in Asia:China reported 40 new cases, all but 4 in Hubei province, raising its overall total to 80,735 cases. It also reported 22 more deaths, lifting that total to 3,119, according to the National Health Commission. Given the steep decline in new cases, the country also announced that it expects to close all of its makeshift hospitals by tomorrow.\nJapan today reported 19 more cases, increasing its total to 457. The most recent infections were reported from 10 prefectures. The health ministry lists its overall total as 513, which includes 56 asymptomatic carriers.\nSingapore today confirmed 10 more cases, 6 linked to a private dinner cluster, 1 a church cluster, and 3 considered imported cases, according to the health ministry, which says the country has now recorded 160 cases.\nPhilippines health emergency; new Nigeria case  The Philippines today declared a health emergency, which was followed by an announcement of 10 more confirmed cases, raising the country's total to 20, the Straits Times reported. Over the weekend, Health Minister Francisco Duque, MD, warned that transitioning from local to sustained transmission can happen quickly.\n  In Africa, Nigeria reported its second case, involving a contact of the country's first confirmed case, the country's health ministry said. Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said today that the continent has reported a total to 90 cases in 9 countries.\n  The WHO said today in its latest daily update that, of 109,578 global cases, 28,674 from 104 countries outside of China have been reported.",

Speakers will include Governor Gary R. Herbert, UDOH State Epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn, DCHD Executive Director Brian Hatch, and UDOH Executive Director Dr. Joseph Miner. Media should access the EOC via the west steps of the State Capitol, an escort will be present to lead you to the EOC.\n\nThe patient is believed to have been exposed to COVID-19 while on a recent cruise aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship. It\u2019s important to recognize this case does not represent community spread of COVID-19 in Utah.\n\nAfter returning to Utah, the patient visited their health care provider after developing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection. The patient\u2019s medical provider collected a clinical sample and submitted it to the Utah Public Health Laboratory (UPHL) for testing.\n\nBecause the sample was tested by UPHL, the case is considered to be a \u201cpresumptive positive\u201d and further confirmatory testing will be carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe patient is a resident of Davis County and is older than 60. To protect the patient\u2019s privacy, no further details about them will be released. The patient is recovering at home and is under a county-issued isolation order. The Davis County Health Department will monitor the patient, as well as any of the patient\u2019s close contacts.\n\nThe COVID-19 Community Task Force, under the leadership of Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, is monitoring the situation closely, and is prepared to offer any necessary assistance to the Davis County Health Department.\n\n\u201cOur first priority will be ensuring the patient\u2019s family members and medical providers are monitored for potential symptoms and tested, if necessary,\u201d said Brian Hatch, director of the Davis County Health Department. \u201cWe will also work closely with the patient to determine if they may have exposed any other members of the community.\u201d\n\nThe UDOH will assist the DCHD in identifying and contacting anyone who may have been in close contact with the confirmed case. These individuals will be monitored for fever and respiratory symptoms.\n\n\u201cEven though a person in Utah has developed the illness, the risk to the general public remains low,\u201d said Dr. Angela Dunn, Utah State Epidemiologist. \u201cHowever, this case does represent a turning point in our response. Home isolation of confirmed cases who aren\u2019t sick enough to be hospitalized is a proven measure that will help limit the spread of disease. We need the public to understand this, as isolating these types of cases at home will become more routine as we identify additional cases.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, I\u2019m hopeful this patient will make a fast and full recovery. This is undoubtedly a frightening situation for their patient and their family, and we stand ready to assist them,\u201d said Governor Gary R. Herbert. \u201cUtah residents should feel confident that all levels of state and local government, and our health care providers have been preparing for this moment for many weeks now. We will certainly see additional cases in the near future, and we are prepared to take the necessary steps to protect the public\u2019s health and limit the spread of this illness.\u201d\n\nThe symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to what someone may be experiencing as the result of seasonal influenza \u2013 namely a fever, cough, or shortness of breath. These symptoms on their own are not worrisome and should not cause alarm. But if someone exhibits these symptoms who has recently traveled to areas with widespread COVID-19 illness or has been in close contact with a known positive case, that individual should immediately notify their health care provider, who will coordinate with the appropriate public health officials to determine next steps.\n\nThere is currently no vaccine available for coronavirus and it is flu and respiratory disease season. The UDOH recommends getting vaccinated for influenza, and taking everyday preventive actions to stop the spread of germs including regular hand washing, covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or an elbow, and staying home when you\u2019re sick. All nonessential travel to areas affected by COVID-19 is also discouraged.\n\nMore information about novel coronavirus can be found at coronavirus.utah.gov or at cdc.gov/coronavirus.\n\n# # #\nhttps://health.utah.gov/featured-new...se-of-covid-19",

Cell cultures and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were done on throat swabs and samples of sputum, stool, blood, and urine. Throat swabs showed very high viral shedding during the first week of symptoms.\n  The findings contrasted starkly with those from the 2003 outbreak of SARS in terms of viral load. \"In SARS, it took 7 to 10 days after onset until peak RNA concentrations (of up to 5x105 copies per swab) were reached,\" the researchers wrote. \"In the present study, peak concentrations were reached before day 5, and were more than 1,000 times higher.\"\n  Throat swabs were much more sensitive with COVID-19 than with the SARS virus, and the virus was easier to isolate. Seven of the nine patients had upper respiratory infection.\nSocial distancing to prevent infection  Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, which publishes CIDRAP News, said that the results challenge the World Health Organization's assertion that COVID-19 can be contained. \n  The findings confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing, he said. They also challenge the idea that contact with contaminated surfaces is a primary means of spread, Osterholm said.\n  \"Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds,\" he said. \"Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now.\"\nData generally back 2-week quarantine   The Johns Hopkins study used news reports and press releases to analyze the demographics and dates and times of possible exposure, emergence of symptoms, fever onset, and hospitalization of 181 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection outside Hubei province, China, from Jan 4 to Feb 24.\n  The researchers estimated the median incubation period at 5.1 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5 to 5.8 days). They found that 97.5% of patients who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days).\n  After the recommended 14-day quarantine or active monitoring period, \"it is highly unlikely that further symptomatic infections would be undetected among high-risk persons,\" the authors wrote. \"However, substantial uncertainty remains in the classification of persons as being at 'high,' 'medium,' or 'low' risk for being symptomatic, and this method does not consider the role of asymptomatic infection.\"\n  Understanding how long active monitoring is needed to limit the risk of missing COVID-19 infections is important for health departments faced with limited resources. The results support current proposals for length of quarantine or active monitoring of people who may have been exposed to [COVID-19], \"although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases,\" they wrote.\n  In a Johns Hopkins news release today, senior author Justin Lessler, PhD, an associate professor in the Bloomberg School's Department of Epidemiology, said, \"The current recommendation of 14 days for active monitoring or quarantine is reasonable, although with that period some cases would be missed over the long-term.\"\n  Of the 181 patients, 69 (38%) were female, 108 were male (60%), and 4 (2%) were of unknown sex. Median age was 44.5 years. Cases were collected from 24 countries and areas outside mainland China (108 cases) and 25 provinces in mainland China (73 cases).\n  The researchers noted that publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, which may have a different incubation period than that of mild cases.",

It reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice.Abstract\nInfo/History\nMetrics\nPreview PDF\nAbstract\n\n\nBackground: Estimating key infectious disease parameters from the COVID-19 outbreak is quintessential for modelling studies and guiding intervention strategies. Whereas different estimates for the incubation period distribution and the serial interval distribution have been reported, estimates of the generation interval for COVID-19 have not been provided.\n\nMethods: We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates we obtained the proportions pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers.\n\nResults: The mean generation interval was 5.20 (95%CI 3.78-6.78) days for Singapore and 3.95 (95%CI 3.01-4.91) days for Tianjin, China when relying on a previously reported incubation period with mean 5.2 and SD 2.8 days. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95%CI 32-67%) for Singapore and 62% (95%CI 50-76%) for Tianjin, China. Estimates of the reproduction number based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution.\n\nConclusions: Estimating generation and serial interval distributions from outbreak data requires careful investigation of the underlying transmission network. Detailed contact tracing information is essential for correctly estimating these quantities.\n\n\nCompeting Interest Statement\n\n\nThe authors have declared no competing interest.\n\nFunding Statement\n\n\nNH acknowledges funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union\u0092s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement 682540 - TransMID).

But Messonnier cautioned that now is the time for the people who are most at risk for serious disease, including those over 60 or those with underlying health conditions, to take precautions.\n  \"People at higher risk should avoid crowds, non-essential travel on longer plane rides, and cruises,\" Messonnier said, referring to a State Department warning made over the weekend that said Americans, especially with underlying health conditions, should avoid cruises.\n  While most communities in America are not seeing widespread community transmission, Messonnier said she's advising older people \u2013 including her parents \u2013 to stock up on medications, some groceries, and plan on avoiding close contact with people who seem sick.\n  \"I understand these recommendations may not be popular and that they may be difficult for some people,\" said Messonnier. All of Messonnier's recommendations are outlined in a new document from the CDC\n   Yesterday the CDC released new guidelines for physicians on testing for COVID-19. Messonnier said there were currently enough COVID-19 tests in 78 public health labs across the country to diagnose 75,000 cases of the virus. More capacity will be expected in the next 2 weeks as commercial labs begin to offer their own tests.\n  \"Mildly ill patients should be encouraged to stay home and contact their healthcare provider by phone for guidance about clinical management,\" the CDC said. \"Patients who have severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, should seek care immediately. Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness.\"\n  As of Sunday night, the CDC confirmed 34 states have cases of COVID-19, as well as New York City and Washington D.C.\nCases surge in New York, Washington state  Today both New York and Washington state reported a sharp increase in cases, with New York confirming 37 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the state's total to 142 cases, including 98 in Westchester County.\n  Governor Andrew Cuomo tweeted several new policies for the state, including news that schools in the state with a positive student or employee will immediately be closed for 24 hours for a health assessment.\n  Cuomo said of the 142 cases, 8 are hospitalized (6%). He also said New York would begin manufacturing its own hand sanitizer in state prisons for use throughout the state to combat price gouging and shortages.\n  In Washington State, King County reported 33 new cases today, and three additional fatalities. This brings the county total to 116 cases and 20 deaths. All three fatalities were in Life Care Center residents. Life Care, a long-term nursing facility in Kirkland, has been the epicenter of Washington's outbreak.\n  According to King County officials, Life Care Center said it has completed testing all of its remaining residents and is awaiting test results.\nNational Public Radio reports the University of Washington-Seattle is now operating the country's first drive-through COVID-19 testing operation for employees of the university's medical system. Drive-through testing has been widely used in South Korea.\nIowa, Ohio report first cases  According to the COVID-19 tracker maintained by Johns Hopkins University, the United States has 607 cases, including 25 deaths, as of Monday afternoon. Both Iowa and Ohio reported their first cases of the coronavirus.\n  In Iowa, the department of public health (IDPH) said yesterday three presumptive cases come from Johnson County, and all are recovering at home. \n  \"All three individuals were part of a cruise in Egypt,\" said IDPH Medical Director and State Epidemiologist, Caitlin Pedati, MD, in a press statement. \"IDPH is working with local public health to assess potential exposures to others. These cases are an important reminder that all Iowans need to help prevent the spread of illness by washing hands frequently, staying home when ill, and covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue.\"\n  In Ohio, three residents of Cuyahoga County tested positive for the virus, prompting Governor Mike DeWine to declare a state of emergency.\nIncreases in Massachusetts, LA  Over the weekend, Massachusetts reported 15 new presumptive positive cases, raising the state total to 28. All 15 cases had a direct connection to the Biogen conference held in Boston in late February. In total, 23 of the state's 28 cases are associated with that conference.\n  Los Angeles also reported two new cases of the virus today, including what is the city's first case of community transmission. The other case had recently traveled to Japan. LA County now has 16 cases.\n  \"This is our first case of community transmission in LA County and we will continue to see more cases of COVID- 19,\" said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, director of LA's public health department, in a press statement.\n  \"We continue to urge everyone to do their part: stay home if you are sick and keep your children home if they are sick; plan for the possibility of school and business closures, and be sure to follow any additional directives issued by Public Health and/or local officials. By working together, we can slow the transmission of novel coronavirus.\"\nFour members of Congress self-quarantine  Also today, more members of Congress said they were self-quarantining after coming into contact with a COVID-19 patient at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).\n  According to CNN, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia and Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida are now the following the leads of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, who announced they were self-quarantining over the weekend. Gaetz rode on Air Force One with President Trump today, and Collins shook the president's hand during a visit to the CDC late last week.",

CRE are considered an urgent healthcare threat by the CDC because they are frequently multidrug resistant and can carry mobile resistance elements that are easily shared with other bacteria.\nHigh death rate in CRE patients  For the study, CDC-defined CRE were Enterobacterales that were resistant to one or more carbapenems, including ertapenem, were documented to harbor a gene encoding a carbapenemase enzyme, or were positive for carbapenemase production. The primary clinical outcome was desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR), which assigns higher ranks to patients with better overall clinical outcomes, at 30 days after the index culture. \n  Of the 1,040 patients included in the study, 449 (43%) had an infection and 591 (57%) were colonized with CRE. The CDC-defined CRE admission rate was 57 per 100,000 admissions.\n  Analysis of the 1,040 isolates identified three mutually exclusive subsets of CRE: carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE, 618 isolates, 59%), non-carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (non-CPE, 194, 19%), and unconfirmed CRE (228, 22%), which were initially reported as CRE but were later found to be susceptible to carbapenems at two central laboratories. Klebsiella pneumoniae accounted for 80% (493 of 618) of CPE isolates.\n  The most commonly identified carbapenemase genes among CPE were Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (93%), New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases (3%), and oxacillinase-48-like beta-lactamases (3%).\n  Analysis of clinical outcomes showed that, of the 449 patients with infections, 24% were dead at 30 days, but 30-day mortality was not significantly different among the three subgroups after adjusting for possible confounding factors: 25% for CPE, 22% for non-CPE, and 23% for unconfirmed CRE.\nNot all CRE are alike  The authors of the study, a team led by researchers from the University of North Carolina and the University of Health Sciences Center at Houston, say the finding that 41% of the CRE isolates did not carry carbapenemase genes, and that 22% were not carbapenem resistant upon further testing, is an important one because hospitals put a lot of focus on prevention of CPE, which are associated with poor outcomes and are known to spread rapidly in healthcare settings. But efforts to prevent and treat CPE in hospitals might not be as effective against other types of CRE, which are just as deadly, they argue.\n  \"Correct identification of carbapenemase production at the patient, hospital, regional, and national levels is important for treatment selection, infection control, and prevention of spread,\" they wrote.\n  In an accompanying commentary, infectious disease experts from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis say the results underscore the need for more research into how different types of CRE emerge and spread, and how hospitals can combat them.\n  \"First, the absence of difference in clinical outcomes among CRE groups warrant new evidence-based epidemiological health-care policies,\" they wrote. \"Studies focusing on transmissibility and the effect of antibiotic exposure on the emergence and acquisition risk of various types of CRE are needed so that effective prevention strategies can be designed.\"\n  They also call for randomized controlled trials on effective antibiotics for all CRE infections, and enhanced guidance on identifying unconfirmed CRE.",

The MOH listed the case as primary, meaning he is unlikely to have contracted the virus from another person. The patient is not a healthcare worker, and his contact with camels is unknown.\n  Yesterday the MOH reported that a 35-year-old man from Riyadh was also diagnosed as having MERS. His case is also listed as primary, but he did have contact with camels, a known risk factor for contracting the disease.\n  As of Jan 31, the World Health Organization said that it had received reports of 2,519 laboratory-con\ufb01rmed MERS infections, including 866 associated deaths. The vast majority of these cases occurred in Saudi Arabia.\nMar 7 MOH report\nMar 8 MOH report\n\nStudy: Flu case definitions often invalid in seniors  Flu surveillance case definitions miss many hospitalized patients 65 years and older who have laboratory-confirmed infection\u2014especially those who are frail, according to a prospective cohort study in today's Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology.\n  Researchers from the Canadian Immunization Research Network and Serious Outcomes Surveillance (SOS) Network determined that standard influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) case definitions are biased toward detecting infection in people younger than 65 and thus do not characterize the true burden of the flu.\n  The validity of flu case definitions is important because older people, who are particularly susceptible to the flu and its complications, often have atypical signs and symptoms of infection.\n  The researchers used pooled data from the 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14 flu seasons and measured frailty using a validated frailty index. Of 11,379 adult inpatients (7,254 older than 65), 4,942 (2,948 older than 65) had laboratory-confirmed flu. The patients' median age was 72 years (interquartile range [IQR], 58 to 82), and 52.6% were women.\n  The sensitivity of ILI criteria was 51.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.6% to 52.6%) for adults younger than 65 versus 44.6% (95% CI, 43.6% to 45.8%) for older adults. SARI criteria were met by 64.1% (95% CI, 62.7% to 65.6%) of the younger adults versus 57.1% (95% CI, 55.9% to 58.2%) of older patients with laboratory-confirmed flu. Frail or prefrail patients were less likely than their peers to fit ILI and SARI case definitions.\n  \"Because of the substantial fraction of cases missed, surveillance definitions should not be used to guide diagnosis and clinical management of influenza,\" the authors wrote.\n  The SOS Network conducts active surveillance for flu in hospitalized adults.\nMar 9 Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol abstract",

In more serious cases, it can cause pneumonia. There have been more than 500 confirmed cases in the United States, and more than 20 deaths.\n\nMessonnier, the director of CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, used the press briefing Monday to urge Americans who face higher risks of developing more severe disease, including seniors and people with underlying health conditions, to take precautions and prepare. Such steps include avoiding crowds and contact with people who are sick, and frequent hand washing.\n\nShe also said that high-risk Americans should stock up on their medications and groceries, and that family members of those high-risk people should create a plan should they get sick and they can no longer help their relatives.\n\n\u201cYou may need to identify backups,\u201d Messonnier said.\n\nShe added: \u201cI understand these recommendations may not be popular and that they may be difficult for some people.\u201d...\n\nRead more: https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/09/...official-says/",

Iss: \"Fever and breathlessness, the most common initial symptoms for those who have died positive from the virus\" (from Quotidosanita.it of 7 March 2020)\n\nNew analysis of the Italian Institute of Health on 155 Italian patients who died on 6 March from Covid-19. Brusaferro: \u201cThese data suggest that for those with only fever it is sufficient to alert their doctor while staying at home while in the presence of both symptoms it is better to contact 112 or 118. In any case we remind you that you must absolutely avoid going on your own from doctor or emergency room, to avoid exposing staff and patients to risks \".\n\n\n07 MAR - \u201cIn deceased and COVID-19 positive patients the most common onset symptoms are fever and dyspnoea (difficulty breathing), while gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea) and hemoptysis, the emission of blood from the respiratory tract, for example with a cough. \" This was stated by the analysis of the data of 155 Italian patients who died on 6 March conducted by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, which updates the one conducted on 105 cases made known on 5 March.\n\nFever and dyspnoea are present as onset symptoms in 86% and 82% of cases examined respectively. Other initial symptoms found are cough (50%), and precisely diarrhea and hemoptysis (5%).\n\n\"These data suggest that for those with only fever it is sufficient to alert their doctor while staying at home - explains Silvio Brusaferro , president of the ISS -, while in the presence of both symptoms it is better to contact 112 or 118. In any case, we remember that you must absolutely avoid going to your doctor or emergency room on your own, to avoid exposing staff and patients to risks. Following this and all the other prevention rules dictated these days is essential to slow down the epidemic as much as possible and protect the most fragile people. Individual measures to limit social contacts are fundamental to be able to fight the virus, we appeal to everyone's sense of responsibility \u201d.\n\nAs regards virus-related mortality, the updated data confirm those of the first study. The mean age of deceased and COVID-19 positive patients is 81.4. There are 48 women (31.0%). The average number of pathologies observed in this population is 3.6. Deaths occur mostly after 80 years and in people with important pre-existing diseases: in detail, mortality is 14.3% over 90 years, 8.2% between 80 and 89, 4% between 70 and 79, 1.4% between 60 and 69 and 0.1% between 50 and 59, while there are no deaths under this age group. Overall, 21 patients (15.5% of the sample) had 0 or 1 pathology, 25 (18.5%) had 2 pathologies and 70 (60.3%) had 3 or more pathologies; for 19 patients it has not yet been possible to recover the information.\n\nItaly-China comparison\n\nThe update of the data confirms that in all age groups lethality in the Italian population is lower than that observed in China. The overall lethality in Italy out of 155 cases is 2.9% against 2.3% in China. The general figure is higher in the Italian population because the average age of the Italian population is greater than in China (44 vs 37 years - WHO 2013 estimates) and in Italy there is a greater number of patients over the age of 80 .\n\"The analysis of these data allows to carry out evaluations on which to establish recommendations and behaviors - underlines Brusaferro - therefore it is essential that the surveillance system is constantly updated with the medical records of the deceased by hospitals\".\n\nhttps://www.ordinemedicilatina.it/se...-7-marzo-2020/",

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "The UK may be facing a uniquely difficult situation in that there is currently a critical shortage of nurses, doctors and NHS beds. In England alone the shortage of medics is @45,000 nurses and over 10,000 doctors with the net result that current levels of NHS services are severely stretched, and existing medics are suffering from burn out and exhaustion as a consequence of extraordinary levels of sustained pressures that have been ongoing for the last few years. This will place them at significant risk of severe infections, before any battle against the coronavirus starts, and the UK cannot afford to lose any medical staff to widespread illness. A severe flu season has already stretched services to the maximum, both in terms of personnel and resources on top of an already bad situation.\n\nThis thread is designed to allow us to discuss the issues facing the UK, post relevant news stories on how the UK plans to manage this epidemic and brainstorm ideas as to how the UK could manage the issues that a major coronavirus outbreak would bring. There are insufficient resources to employ the tactics used by China. Police numbers have been cut to the bone over years of austerity, as have the numbers of armed forces, before any consideration of societal issues.\n\nWhat are the sort of things we could discuss?\n\nAs an example, the current focus would appear to be self isolation for entire families if there is a suspected case; however, like the US there is a preponderance of zero hour contracts, with many low paid workers; a large proportion of households literally live paycheck to paycheck. Without measures to keep people fed, it is difficult to see how self isolation at home can work (people will not be able to afford to comply) and this will apply to a large sector of the population, especially those living in cities. Working from home will not be an option for those working in the restaurant or retail sectors, who are major employers. School closures will also directly affect low income households who rely on the childcare to enable them to work. What are the current UK plans to assist and help families to manage in these circumstances? What happens when people get really sick and there are no hospital beds? I cannot see people complying with a 'stay at home' order in these circumstances.\n\nAgain, for example: Hospitals are completely full with almost zero spare bed capacity. Current options available to discuss could be e.g.\n1. Cancel all elective surgery nationally NOW to allow us to start clearing beds. What are the issues that would result from doing this?\n2. Bed blocking is a significant factor in the UK. Much of the problem relates to who pays for a nursing home bed, and arranging this with local authorities. Should government temporarily agree to fund this directly (whilst we are in emergency mode) to clear beds where possible?\n3. Are there any factories capable of manufacturing PPE equipment domestically or are we entirely reliant on imports? How resilient are our supply chains? What stocks are currently held within hospitals? If we do not have domestic manufacturing capacity are there companies that could be requested to start manufacture?\n\nHopefully this is enough to get going with and stimulate discussion.",

This has been determined today with lab tests. The patient, who recently visited the Lombardy region, is in isolation. The GGD Municipal Health Service maps contacts of this patient through contact research.\n\nThe new coronavirus can spread through drops. For example if someone coughs or sneezes in the face of another. To prevent the disease from spreading further in the Netherlands, the Municipal Health Service (GGD) and the RIVM National Institute for Public Health and the Environment map out who has been in close contact with the infected patient. These people (referred to as contacts) are monitored and must record their temperature twice a day and report this to the GGD. They must also report other complaints that they have. These measures reduce the chance that the disease can spread in the Netherlands.\n\nRIVM remains alert to possible new infections and applies the same protocol when new infections are found: isolation, contact investigation and continuous monitoring of the patient.\n\nSymptoms of the disease are fever and respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath or cough. Someone who has spent the last 14 days in an area where COVID-19 is widespread (such as China, South Korea, but also in some municipalities in Italy) with a fever and one of the aforementioned airway complaints can be tested for COVID-19 , the disease caused by the virus called SARS severe acute respiratory syndrome -CoV coronavirus -2. A doctor can also request this test for someone with these symptoms if he or she has been in contact with a patient with the new corona virus.\n\nRIVM",

Staff of the AFCD picked up the dog from a residential flat at Tai Hang in the evening on the same day and sent the dog to the animal keeping facility at the Hong Kong Port of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. Oral, nasal and rectal samples were collected for testing of COVID-19 virus. The nasal and oral cavity samples were tested weak positive to COVID-19 virus. The dog does not have any relevant symptoms.\n\n     The above dog is the only dog under quarantine at animal keeping facility at the Hong Kong Port of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge at the moment. There are no other animals using the said facility. Staff of the department will step up cleansing and disinfection of the animal keeping facility.\n\nAt present, the AFCD does not have evidence that pet animals can be infected with COVID-19 virus or can be a source of infection to people. The Department will conduct close monitoring of the above dog and collect further samples for testing to confirm if the dog has really been infected with the virus or this is a result of environmental contamination of the dog's mouth and nose. Repeated tests will be conducted for the dog and it will only be returned when the test result is negative.\n\n     The spokesman said that to ensure public and animal health, the department strongly advise mammalian pets of patients confirmed to have been infected with COVID-19 virus to be put under quarantine by the AFCD. The pets will be delivered to the designated animal keeping facilities of the AFCD for quarantine and veterinary surveillance for 14 days. Samples will be collected for testing of COVID-19 virus as appropriate.\n\n     The spokesman reminded the pet owners to maintain a good habit of hygiene, and wash their hands thoroughly with soap or alcohol sanitiser after contacting pets. Pet owners shall wear masks while going out. If there are any changes in the health condition of the pets, advice from veterinarians should be sought as soon as possible. \n\n\n\nEnds/Friday, February 28, 2020\nIssued at HKT 0:55",

It reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice.Abstract\nInfo/History\nMetrics\nPreview PDF\nAbstract\n\n\nBackground: In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), current case definitions presume mainly lower respiratory tract infection. However, cases seen outside the epicenter of the epidemic may differ in their overall clinical appearance due to more sensitive case finding.\n\nMethods: We studied viral load courses by RT-PCR in oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, stool, blood, and urine in nine hospitalized cases. Infectious virus was detected by cell culture. Active replication was demonstrated by analysis of viral subgenomic replicative intermediates. Serology including neutralization testing was done to characterize immune response.\n\nResults: Seven cases had upper respiratory tract disease. Lower respiratory tract symptoms seen in two cases were limited. Clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR on swabs taken on days 1-5 of symptoms was 100%, with no differences comparing swab and sputum samples taken simultaneously. Average viral load was 6.76x10E5 copies per swab during the first 5 days. Live virus isolates were obtained from swabs during the first week of illness. Proof of active viral replication in upper respiratory tract tissues was obtained by detection of subgenomic viral RNA. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after about one week.\n\nConclusions: The present study shows that COVID-19 can often present as a common cold-like illness. SARS-CoV-2 can actively replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and is shed for a prolonged time after symptoms end, including in stool. These findings suggest adjustments of current case definitions and re-evaluation of the prospects of outbreak containment.\n\n\nCompeting Interest Statement\n\n\nThe authors have declared no competing interest.\n\n\nFunding Statement\n\n\nThis work was funded by grants from the German Ministry of Research (01KI1723A) and the European Union (602525) to C.

At this moment, a health team is reconstructing all the close contacts of the person considered at risk, on which the measures set out in the ordinance n.1 of 22 February 2020 and the operating protocol adopted at the health level are being applied.\n\nIn compliance with current provisions, the doctor who assisted the positive patient with COVID-19 was placed in home quarantine together with his family members; and everyone is doing well right now. A substitute medical practitioner has already been identified by the Primary Care Department. Citizens are informed that the patient has never visited the Health Center of Borgo Maggiore and that the hospital environments where he passed through for the first checks have been sanitized.\n\nCitizens are reminded that in case of respiratory ailments, accompanied or not by fever, it is necessary to contact their doctor or the Medical Guard by telephone and not to go to the Emergency Department or Health Centers.\n\nFor information, contact 0549 994001 or the Interforce Operations Center on 0549 888888 for any reports.

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "COVID-19: Adjustment Reactions, Internal Resets, and Denialism\n\n\n\n15,062\n\nJust shy of 10 weeks ago - on the morning of New Year's Eve - the always vigilant newshounds on FluTrackers picked up some obscure reports from China on a cluster of unidentified pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. At 2am, I posted the first of 3 blogs (see China: 27 Cases of `Atypical Viral Pneumonia' Reported In Wuhan, Hubei) I would write that day on it.\nDetails were scant, and while this could be `anything', it also sounded like the opening salvo to every pandemic tabletop exercise I've been a part of. So while the threat was still unquantifiable, Wuhan was suddenly on everyone in the `flu world's' radar. \n\nThe next few days produced very little additional information, and that was worrisome as well. But six days later, the WHO issued their first alert (see WHO DON Statement On Pneumonia of Unknown Cause \u2013 China), and the same day in Wuhan Health Commission: Pneumonia Cases Increase To 59 - Jan 5th, we learned that the outbreak was bigger, and had been going on longer, than we'd previously known.\nWhile scarcely noticed by the mainstream press, the still undiagnosed outbreak in Wuhan was rapidly becoming the number one topic of conversation in Flublogia, and among infectious disease specialists around the world. \n\nTwo days later (Jan 7th), in Hong Kong: Caught With Their Masks Down, we saw the first real indicator that the Wuhan pneumonia might have greater implications as masks in Hong Kong started selling out.\n\nAlthough I feared I might be overreacting, I made it my first - you might want to start preparing for this - blog. I write about preparedness a lot, and usually do something after the holidays every year, so I made it fairly generic.\n\nBut I did mention that face masks might become hard to find, and soon. Two weeks later, they would become almost impossible to find on Amazon. \n\n\nEven though I've been writing about pandemics, and the inevitability of seeing another severe one, for 15 years I was still having trouble actually believing this could be `it'. Since I live in hurricane country, and stay pretty prepared anyway, I didn't do anything different personally, although I did start telling friends and family they might want to review their disaster plans.\nMost ignored the message, and I wondered if I was the one overreacting. \n\nAfter all, there were only 59 cases. It was being presented as a zoonotic spillover at a `seafood market', and according to China, there was no indication of human-to-human spread. We'd been here before with H5N1, and H7N9, and while concerning, neither had `legs'.\n\nI had several `Am I crazy, or does this look serious to you?' conversations with friends, particularly in Flublogia; other bloggers, a few researchers and scientists, and journalists. Everyone seemed uneasy, but none of us - including myself - was convinced this epidemic was ready for prime time.\nSo while I kept watch, and blogged frequently on Wuhan, I kept doing blogs on avian flu outbreaks, earthquakes in Puerto Rico, and MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. Trying to maintain business as usual, at least until we learned more. \n\nBy January 9th, less than two weeks after the first reports out of Wuhan, in the WHO (WPRO) Statement On Cluster Of Pneumonia Cases In Wuhan, China, we learned this unidentified pneumonia was a novel coronavirus.\nAnd that, quite frankly, was a wakeup call. \n\nAlthough its virulence and transmissibility were still unknown, we'd been following SARS, MERS-CoV, and a number of bat-borne coronaviruses with pandemic potential for years. While novel influenza has always been at the top of our pandemic worry list, since 2003, novel coronaviruses have been ranked high as well.\nFour days later, we learned of the first exported nCoV case - in Thailand - and CDC issued updated Guidance and a Risk Assessment for this novel coronavirus (nCoV).  \n\nAt this point I was on board with the idea this epidemic might spread widely, although its virulence and transmissibility was still unknown. Was this going to be like the mild 1947 and 1977 pseudo-pandemics I described in Pseudo Pandemics And Viral Interlopers?\nOr was it going to be something more serious? \n\nFrankly, my opinion - at least internally - was flip-flopping almost by the hour. Some reports looked alarming, while others painted this threat as overblown. I was going through my own `Adjustment Reaction', trying to be prudent, while at the same time trying not to overreact.\nWhich is something that I'm seeing a lot of online, in politicians, among public health officials, and in the stock market. And while this struggle to accept the COVID-19 threat as a real and imminent threat is understandable, the time for committing to action is growing short. \n\nIt would take me another ten days before I was fully convinced that this novel coronavirus was a legitimate pandemic threat. And I've had 15 years to think about such things. On January 25th, in Not Too Soon To Be Thinking About Preparedness, I made the case for getting prepared.\nWhat helped me to get over this psychological `hump' was re-reading risk communication expert Peter Sandman's essay from 2005 called Adjustment Reactions: The Teachable Moment in Crisis Communication. \n\nIt reminded me that a little bit of `over-reaction' was not only understandable, it was a natural, healthy, and useful survival skill. I highly recommend you read it (or anything else penned by Peter Sandman & Jody Lanard). \n\nA brief excerpt:\nThis is the teachable moment! Instead of criticizing or ridiculing people\u2019s adjustment reactions to emerging crises, smart crisis communicators encourage the adjustment reactions, legitimize them, ally with them, and guide them.\nIt\u2019s okay to tell people that they\u2019re jumping the gun a little \u2013 that there is still time and you advise them to hold off on particular precautions until the risk gets closer, bigger, or clearer. It\u2019s okay to recommend substitute precautions \u2013 precautions that are more useful or less burdensome or less likely to backfire than the ones they\u2019re attracted to. It\u2019s okay to remind them that nobody knows yet whether the situation will worsen or blow over, that they should try to stay poised to ramp up or ramp down their level of concern. That\u2019s all part of guiding the adjustment reaction.\nWhat isn\u2019t okay is to suggest that people shouldn\u2019t be worried yet, that they shouldn\u2019t take any precautions or even think about what precautions they want to take until you give the word. It isn\u2019t okay to tell people that their normal and useful impulse to rehearse is irrational or panicky. Healthy people are going to rehearse. They are going to imagine the worst before it happens and before we know for sure if it\u2019s coming. They are going to take premature precautions. An adjustment reaction is a big improvement over being caught unawares. Don\u2019t try to tell people not to have one. Help them have a good one. \n\nWhile I personally `accepted' the inevitability of this pandemic more than 6 weeks ago, I still vacillate on how bad I think it might be. I'm thinking it could be pretty bad, at least for many places and people around the world.\nBut whether that is 1918-bad, or not, I still don't know. But I consider it entirely possible. \n\nPredictions and projections don't really matter at this point. It is going to be what it is, and we will find out in the weeks ahead. We either go into this blindly clinging to the hope COVID-19 fizzles - or we do what we can now to blunt its impact - and accept that in some areas, we may overreact.\nI know everyone out there is going through the same `is it, or isn't it' struggle that I've gone through over the past 10 weeks. And although I've written on this topic a thousand times, this all feels vaguely surreal, even to me. \n\nIf you are worried, maybe even a little panicky, you are not alone. You are having an `Adjustment Reaction' toa looming, but still unquantifiable threat. The best way to handle that is to take a deep breath, accept that COVID-19 poses a genuine if ill-defined threat, and then do what you can reasonably do now to offset the risks to you and your family.\nThat is what makes having an Adjustment Reaction a useful,natural and healthy human response. It helps us to prepare, and react, when conditions warrant. \n\nAnd that is why you should not only accept it, you should embrace it.\n\nhttps://afludiary.blogspot.com/2020/...-internal.html",

Potential Factors Influencing Repeated SARS Outbreaks in China.Sun Z1, Thilakavathy K1,2, Kumar SS2,3, He G4, Liu SV5.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Within last 17 years two widespread epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in China, which were caused by related coronaviruses (CoVs): SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Although the origin(s) of these viruses are still unknown and their occurrences in nature are mysterious, some general patterns of their pathogenesis and epidemics are noticeable. Both viruses utilize the same receptor-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-for invading human bodies. Both epidemics occurred in cold dry winter seasons celebrated with major holidays, and started in regions where dietary consumption of wildlife is a fashion. Thus, if bats were the natural hosts of SARS-CoVs, cold temperature and low humidity in these times might provide conducive environmental conditions for prolonged viral survival in these regions concentrated with bats. The widespread existence of these bat-carried or -released viruses might have an easier time in breaking through human defenses when harsh winter makes human bodies more vulnerable. Once succeeding in making some initial human infections, spreading of the disease was made convenient with increased social gathering and holiday travel. These natural and social factors influenced the general progression and trajectory of the SARS epidemiology. However, some unique factors might also contribute to the origination of SARS in Wuhan. These factors are discussed in different scenarios in order to promote more research for achieving final validation.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  2019-nCoV; ACE2; COVID-19; CoV; SARS; SARS-CoV; Wuhan pneumonia; angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; bat; coronavirus; drought; epidemic; epidemiology; exposure; green light; host; infection; outbreak; red light; risk; severe acute respiratory syndrome; wildlife\n\n PMID: \t32138266 \tDOI: \t10.3390/ijerph17051633 \n  Free full text",

There are significant knowledge gaps in the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, investigation tools and management. In this article, we review the available evidence about this disease. Every decade has witnessed the evolution of a new coronavirus epidemic since the last three decades. The varying transmission patterns, namely, nosocomial transmission and spread through mildly symptomatic cases is an area of concern. There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications like severe pneumonia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury and septic shock. Presence of bilateral ground glass opacity and consolidation on imaging in appropriate clinical background should raise a suspicion about COVID 19. Poor prognostic factors include Multilobular infiltration on chest imaging, Lymphopenia, Bacterial co-infection, Smoking history, Chronic medical conditions like Hypertension and age >60 years (MuLBSTA score). Diagnosis is confirmed with PCR based testing of appropriate respiratory samples. Management is primarily supportive, with newer antivirals (lopinavir ritonavir and Remdesivir) under investigation. Role of steroids is still inconclusive. Standard infection control and prevention techniques should be followed. Vigilant screening of suspected cases and their contacts is important. Isolation of symptomatic cases and home quarantine of asymptomatic contacts is recommended. To conclude, controlling this highly transmissible disease requires international co-ordination.\n  \u00a9 Journal of the Association of Physicians of India 2011.\n\n\n PMID: \t32138488",

Influence of trust on two different risk perceptions as an affective and cognitive dimension during Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea: serial cross-sectional surveys.Jang WM1, Kim UN2,3, Jang DH4, Jung H1,3, Cho S3, Eun SJ5, Lee JY6,7.\nAuthor informationAbstract OBJECTIVES:  This study aimed to assess the affective and cognitive risk perceptions in the general population of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) during the 2015 MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea and the influencing factors.\nDESIGN:  Serial cross-sectional design with four consecutive surveys.\nSETTING:  Nationwide general population in South Korea.\nPARTICIPANTS:  Overall 4010 respondents (aged 19 years and over) from the general population during the MERS-CoV epidemic were included.\nPRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES:  The main outcome measures were (1) affective risk perception, (2) cognitive risk perception, and (3) trust in the government. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors (demographic, socioeconomic, area and political orientation) associated with risk perceptions.\nRESULTS:  Both affective and cognitive risk perceptions decreased as the MERS-CoV epidemic progressed. Proportions of affective risk perception were higher in all surveys and slowly decreased compared with cognitive risk perception over time. Females (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.72-2.00; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.86) and lower self-reported household economic status respondents were more likely to perceive the affective risk. The older the adults, the higher the affective risk perception, but the lower the cognitive risk perception compared with younger adults. The respondents who had low trust in the government had higher affective (aOR 2.19-3.11; 95\u2009CI 1.44 to 4.67) and cognitive (aOR 3.55-5.41; 95\u2009CI 1.44 to 9.01) risk perceptions.\nCONCLUSIONS:  This study suggests that even if cognitive risk perception is dissolved, affective risk perception can continue during MERS-CoV epidemic. Risk perception associating factors (ie, gender, age and self-reported household economic status) appear to be noticeably different between affective and cognitive dimensions. It also indicates that trust in the government influences affective risk perception and cognitive risk perception. There is a need for further efforts to understand the mechanism regarding the general public's risk perception for e\ufb00ective risk communication.\n  \u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus 2019) - recent trends.Kannan S1, Shaik Syed Ali P, Sheeza A, Hemalatha K.\nAuthor informationAbstract   The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a warning that, although the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from Wuhan City (China), is not pandemic, it should be contained to prevent the global spread. The COVID-19 virus was known earlier as 2019-nCoV. As of 12 February 2020, WHO reported 45,171 cases and 1115 deaths related to COVID-19. COVID-19 is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and epidemiology. Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that COVID-19 has a better sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV. However, the amino acid sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the regions of 1ab polyprotein and surface glycoprotein or S-protein. Although several animals have been speculated to be a reservoir for COVID-19, no animal reservoir has been already confirmed. COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has similar symptoms as SARS-CoV. Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19 has nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV. The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity. In a similar fashion to SARS-CoV, the N protein of COVID-19 may play an important role in suppressing the RNA interference (RNAi) to overcome the host defense. This mini-review aims at investigating the most recent trend of COVID-19.\n\n\n PMID: \t32141569 \tDOI: \t10.26355/eurrev_202002_20378",

This study aimed at investigating the global prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus, Wuhan China (2019-nCoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outbreaks.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:  The data on the global outbreak of \"2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV\" were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), concerned ministries and research institutes. We also recorded the information from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in ISI Web of Science and research centers on the prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV.\nRESULTS:  Worldwide, SARS-CoV involved 32 countries, with 8422 confirmed cases and 916 (10.87%) casualties from November 2002 to August 2003. MERS-CoV spread over 27 states, causing 2496 cases and 868 (34.77%) fatalities during the period April 2012 to December 2019. However, the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV spread swiftly the global borders of 27 countries. It infected 34799 people and resulted in 724 (2.08%) casualties during the period December 29, 2019 to February 7, 2020. The fatality rate of coronavirus MERS-CoV was (34.77%) higher than SARS-CoV (10.87%) and 2019-nCoV (2.08%); however, the 2019-nCoV transmitted rapidly in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.\nCONCLUSIONS:  The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has diverse epidemiological and biological characteristics, making it more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It has affected more people in a short time period compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although the fatality rate of MERS-CoV was higher than SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. The major clinical manifestations in coronavirus infections 2019-nCoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV are fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhea, confusion, dyspnea, and pneumonia. Global health authorities should take immediate measures to prevent the outbreaks of such emerging and reemerging pathogens across the globe to minimize the disease burden locally and globally.\n\n\n PMID: \t32141570 \tDOI: \t10.26355/eurrev_202002_20379",

This virus is the same member of the coronavirus family that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) reported in China 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The initial cases have been linked to a live seafood market in Wuhan, China, and the specific animal source is yet to be determined. The detection of this new virus in humans without knowing the source of the infection has raised greatly heightened concerns not only in China, but also internationally. To date, the outbreak has spread to most provinces in China and 25 other countries within a relatively short period. Consequent to its spread, Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020.\n  Copyright \u00a9 World Health Organization (WHO) 2020.

[Epub ahead of print]  Transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak and effectiveness of government interventions: A data-driven analysis.Fang Y1, Nie Y2, Penny M3.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Using the parameterized SEIR model, we simulated the spread dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak and impact of different control measures, conducted the sensitivity analysis to identify the key factor, plotted the trend curve of effective reproductive number(R) and performed data fitting after the simulation. By simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02%, suggesting high precision of the data fitting results. More rigorous government control policies were associated with slower increase of the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for sars-cov-2 led to the upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the four-phase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients' being admitted to designated hospitals and comprehensive therapeutic strategy. Collaborative efforts are required to combat the novel coronavirus, focusing on both persistent strict domestic interventions and vigilance against exogenous imported cases.

Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option.

[Epub ahead of print]  Nonstructural proteins NS7b and NS8 are likely to be phylogenetically associated with evolution of 2019-nCoV.Fahmi M1, Kubota Y2, Ito M3.\nAuthor informationAbstract   The seventh novel human infecting Betacoronavirus that causes pneumonia (2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV) originated in Wuhan, China. The evolutionary relationship between 2019-nCoV and the other human respiratory illness-causing coronavirus is not closely related. We sought to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV with other species of Orthocoronavirinae. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the genome sequences. A cluster tree was developed from the profiles retrieved from the presence and absence of homologs of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. The combined data were used to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV to other species of Orthocoronavirinae. Our analysis reliably suggests that 2019-nCoV is most closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 and belongs to subgenus Sarbecovirus of Betacoronavirus, together with SARS coronavirus and Bat-SARS-like coronavirus. The phylogenetic profiling cluster of homolog proteins of one annotated 2019-nCoV protein against other genome sequences revealed two clades of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. Clade 1 consisted of a group of conserved proteins in Orthocoronavirinae comprising Orf1ab polyprotein, Nucleocapsid protein, Spike glycoprotein, and Membrane protein. Clade 2 comprised six proteins exclusive to Sarbecovirus and Hibecovirus. Two of six Clade 2 nonstructural proteins, NS7b and NS8, were exclusively conserved among 2019-nCoV, BetaCoV_RaTG, and BatSARS-like Cov. NS7b and NS8 have previously been shown to affect immune response signaling in the SARS-CoV experimental model. Thus, we speculated that knowledge of the functional changes in the NS7b and NS8 proteins during evolution may provide important information to explore the human infective property of 2019-nCoV.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020.

Insights into the Recent 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Light of Past Human Coronavirus Outbreaks.Ashour HM1,2, Elkhatib WF3,4, Rahman MM5, Elshabrawy HA6.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Coronaviruses (CoVs) are RNA viruses that have become a major public health concern since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2002. The continuous evolution of coronaviruses was further highlighted with the emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012. Currently, the world is concerned about the 2019 novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) that was initially identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. Patients presented with severe viral pneumonia and respiratory illness. The number of cases has been mounting since then. As of late February 2020, tens of thousands of cases and several thousand deaths have been reported in China alone, in addition to thousands of cases in other countries. Although the fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is currently lower than SARS-CoV, the virus seems to be highly contagious based on the number of infected cases to date. In this review, we discuss structure, genome organization, entry of CoVs into target cells, and provide insights into past and present outbreaks. The future of human CoV outbreaks will not only depend on how the viruses will evolve, but will also depend on how we develop efficient prevention and treatment strategies to deal with this continuous threat.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  2019-nCoV; COVID-19; MERS; SARS; SARS-CoV-2\n\n PMID: \t32143502 \tDOI: \t10.3390/pathogens9030186",

Prediction of Epidemic Spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Driven by Spring Festival Transportation in China: A Population-Based Study.Fan C1, Liu L2,3, Guo W3, Yang A3, Ye C3, Jilili M3, Ren M3, Xu P4, Long H5, Wang Y1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   After the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, we estimated the distribution and scale of more than 5 million migrants residing in Wuhan after they returned to their hometown communities in Hubei Province or other provinces at the end of 2019 by using the data from the 2013-2018 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS). We found that the distribution of Wuhan's migrants is centred in Hubei Province (approximately 75%) at a provincial level, gradually decreasing in the surrounding provinces in layers, with obvious spatial characteristics of circle layers and echelons. The scale of Wuhan's migrants, whose origins in Hubei Province give rise to a gradient reduction from east to west within the province, and account for 66% of Wuhan's total migrants, are from the surrounding prefectural-level cities of Wuhan. The distribution comprises 94 districts and counties in Hubei Province, and the cumulative percentage of the top 30 districts and counties exceeds 80%. Wuhan's migrants have a large proportion of middle-aged and high-risk individuals. Their social characteristics include nuclear family migration (84%), migration with families of 3-4 members (71%), a rural household registration (85%), and working or doing business (84%) as the main reason for migration. Using a quasi-experimental analysis framework, we found that the size of Wuhan's migrants was highly correlated with the daily number of confirmed cases. Furthermore, we compared the epidemic situation in different regions and found that the number of confirmed cases in some provinces and cities in Hubei Province may be underestimated, while the epidemic situation in some regions has increased rapidly. The results are conducive to monitoring the epidemic prevention and control in various regions.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  2019 novel coronavirus; population size; quasi-experimental approach; social characteristics of floating population; the origins of Wuhan's migrants\n\n PMID: \t32143519 \tDOI: \t10.3390/ijerph17051679",

This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state. This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002-2003 and MERS in 2012. While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is currently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much of the damage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident. While these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective. Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy. However, it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges. The costs of the epidemic are not limited to medical aspects, as the virus has led to significant sociological, psychological and economic effects globally. Unfortunately, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to numerous reports of Asians being subjected to racist behavior and hate crimes across the world.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The model is calibrated based on internationally reported cases, and shows that at the start of the travel ban from Wuhan on 23 January 2020, most Chinese cities had already received many infected travelers. The travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in Mainland China, but has a more marked effect at the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020, American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\n PMID: \t32144116 \tDOI: \t10.1126/science.aba9757",

[Epub ahead of print]  A conceptual model for the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China with individual reaction and governmental action.Lin Q1, Zhao S2, Gao D3, Lou Y4, Yang S5, Musa SS6, Wang MH7, Cai Y8, Wang W9, Yang L10, He D11.\nAuthor informationAbstract   The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, originated in the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, has claimed more than 2200 lives and posed a huge threat to global public health. The Chinese government has implemented control measures including setting up special hospitals and travel restriction to mitigate the spread. We propose conceptual models for the outbreak in Wuhan with the consideration of individual behavioural reaction and governmental actions, e.g., holiday extension, travel restriction, hospitalisation and quarantine. We employed the estimates of these two key components from the 1918 influenza pandemic in London, United Kingdom, incorporated zoonotic introductions and the emigration, then computed future trends and the reporting ratio. The model is concise in structure, and it successfully captures the course of the COVID-19 outbreak, and thus sheds light on understanding the trends of the outbreak.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020.

[Epub ahead of print]  Serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections.Nishiura H1, Linton NM2, Akhmetzhanov AR2.\nAuthor informationAbstract OBJECTIVE:  To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from information on 28 infector-infectee pairs.\nMETHODS:  We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n\u2009=\u200928) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n\u2009=\u200918). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase.\nRESULTS:  Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9).\nCONCLUSIONS:  The serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020.

[Epub ahead of print]  Can we contain the COVID-19 outbreak with the same measures as for SARS?Wilder-Smith A1, Chiew CJ2, Lee VJ3.\nAuthor informationAbstract   The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 resulted in more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths. SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas top-down enforcement of community quarantine. By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated. By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 82\u2008000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths. Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19. COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread. Even if traditional public health measures are not able to fully contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be effective in reducing peak incidence and global deaths. Exportations to other countries need not result in rapid large-scale outbreaks, if countries have the political will to rapidly implement countermeasures.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Travel-related cases were the main source of COVID-19 cases during the early stages of the current epidemic in Italy. The month of February, however, has been dominated by two large clusters of outbreaks in Northern Italy, south of Milan, with mainly local transmission the source of infections. Contact tracing has failed to identify patient zero in one of the outbreaks. As of 28 February 2020, twenty-one cases of COVID-19 have died. Comparison between case fatality rates in China and Italy are identical at 2.3. Additionally, deaths are similar in both countries with fatalities in mostly the elderly with known comorbidities. It will be important to develop point-of-care devices to aid clinicians in stratifying elderly patients as early as possible to determine the potential level of care they will require to improve their chances of survival from COVID-19 disease.\n  Copyright (c) 2020 Rossella Porcheddu, Caterina Serra, David Kelvin, Nikki Kelvin, Salvatore Rubino.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Case Fatality Rates; Italy; Novel coronavirus COVID-19; SARS-CoV-19; outbreak\n\n PMID: \t32146445 \tDOI: \t10.3855/jidc.12600",

Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. As a result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P=0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Overall, the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  COVID-19; China; asymptomatic infections; close contact\n\n PMID: \t32146694 \tDOI: \t10.1007/s11427-020-1661-4",

It supersedes the guidance and recommendations provided in CDC\u2019s HAN 428 distributed on February 28, 2020.\n\nThe outbreak that began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, has now spread throughout China and to 101 other countries and territories, including the United States. As of March 8, 2020, there were more than 105,000 cases reported globally. In addition to sustained transmission in China, there is now community spread in several additional countries. CDC has updated travel guidance to reflect this information (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...ers/index.html).\n\nAs of March 7, 2020, there were a total of 213 cases within the United States, of which, 49 were among repatriated persons from high-risk settings. Among the other 164 cases that were diagnosed in the United States, 36 were among persons with a history of recent travel in China or other affected areas, and 18 were persons in close contact with another confirmed COVID-19 patient (i.e., person-to-person spread); 110 cases are currently under investigation. During the week of February 23, community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 was reported in California in two places, Oregon, and Washington. Community spread in Washington resulted in the first reported case of COVID-19 in a healthcare worker, and the first outbreak in a long-term care facility. The first death due to COVID-19 was also reported from Washington; there have now been 11 reported deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19. As of March 7, 2020, COVID-19 cases had been reported by 19 states. CDC will continue to work with state and local health departments, clinicians, and laboratorians to identify and respond to other cases of COVID-19, especially those with an unknown source of infection, to limit further community spread. The most recent update describing COVID-19 in the United States can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...ses-in-us.html.\n\nRecognizing persons who are at risk for COVID-19 is a critical component of identifying cases and preventing further transmission. With expanding spread of COVID-19, additional areas of geographic risk are being identified and the criteria for considering testing are being updated to reflect this spread. In addition, with increasing access to testing, the criteria for testing for COVID-19 have been expanded to include more symptomatic persons, even in the absence of travel history to affected areas or known exposure to another case, to quickly detect and respond to community spread of the virus in the United States.\n\nCriteria to Guide Evaluation and Laboratory Testing for COVID-19\nClinicians should work with their local and state health departments to coordinate testing through public health laboratories. In addition, COVID-19 diagnostic testing, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), is becoming available in clinical laboratories. This additional testing capacity will allow clinicians to consider COVID-19 testing for a wider group of symptomatic patients.\n\nClinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever1 and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing). Priorities for testing may include:Hospitalized patients who have signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 in order to inform decisions related to infection control.\nOther symptomatic individuals such as, older adults (age \u2265 65 years) and individuals with chronic medical conditions and/or an immunocompromised state that may put them at higher risk for poor outcomes (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, receiving immunosuppressive medications, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease).\nAny persons including healthcare personnel2, who within 14 days of symptom onset had close contact3 with a suspect or laboratory-confirmed4 COVID-19 patient, or who have a history of travel from affected geographic areas5 (see below) within 14 days of their symptom onset.\n\nThere are epidemiologic factors that may also help guide decisions about COVID-19 testing. Documented COVID-19 infections in a jurisdiction and known community transmission may contribute to an epidemiologic risk assessment to inform testing decisions. Clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness (e.g., influenza).\n\nMildly ill patients should be encouraged to stay home and contact their healthcare provider by phone for guidance about clinical management. Patients who have severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, should seek care immediately. Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness.\n\nInternational Areas with Sustained (Ongoing) Transmission\nLast updated March 8, 2020\n(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...ers/index.html)China: Level 3 Travel Health Notice (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices...onavirus-china)\nIran: Level 3 Travel Health Notice (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices...ronavirus-iran)\nItaly: Level 3 Travel Health Notice (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices...onavirus-italy)\nJapan: Level 2 Travel Health Notice (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices...onavirus-japan)\nSouth Korea: Level 3 Travel Health Notice  (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices...us-south-korea)\n\nRecommendations for Reporting, Laboratory Testing, and Specimen Collection\nClinicians should immediately implement recommended infection prevention and control practices (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...endations.html) if a patient is suspected of having COVID-19. They should also notify infection control personnel at their healthcare facility and their state or local health department if it is suspected that a patient may have COVID-19. State health departments that have identified a person suspected of having COVID-19 or a laboratory-confirmed case should complete a PUI and Case Report form through the processes identified on CDC\u2019s Coronavirus Disease 2019 website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...rting-pui.html). If specimens are sent to CDC for laboratory testing, state and local health departments can contact CDC\u2019s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for assistance with obtaining, storing, and shipping, including after hours, on weekends, and holidays.\n\nGuidance for the identification and management of potentially exposed contacts of a confirmed case of COVID-19 can be found in Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Exposures: Geographic Risk and Contacts of Laboratory-confirmed Cases (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...ssessment.html).\n\nSeparate guidance for the management of potentially exposed contacts of a COVID-19 case who are healthcare personnel is provided in Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...sment-hcp.html).\n\nFor initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19, CDC recommends collecting and testing upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal AND oropharyngeal swabs). CDC also recommends testing lower respiratory tract specimens, if available. For patients who develop a productive cough, sputum should be collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2. The induction of sputum is not recommended. For patients for whom it is clinically indicated (e.g., those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation), a lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage sample should be collected and tested as a lower respiratory tract specimen. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a person has been identified for testing, regardless of the time of symptom onset. See Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Patients Under Investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...specimens.html) and Biosafety FAQs for handling and processing specimens from suspected cases and PUIs (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...fety-faqs.html).\n\n1Fever may be subjective or confirmed\n\n2For healthcare personnel, testing may be considered if there has been exposure to a person with suspected COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation. Because of their often extensive and close contact with vulnerable patients in healthcare settings, even mild signs and symptoms (e.g., sore throat) of COVID-19 should be evaluated among potentially exposed healthcare personnel.

Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient). Special consideration should be given to healthcare personnel exposed in healthcare settings as described in CDC\u2019s Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with COVID-19 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...sment-hcp.html).\n\n4Documentation of laboratory-confirmation of COVID-19 may not be possible for travelers or persons caring for COVID-19 patients in other countries.\n\n5Affected areas are defined as geographic regions where sustained community transmission has been identified.

The new development pushes Italy ahead of South Korea as the country with the highest number of cases behind China.\n  The country also finalized a lockdown affecting all of Lombardy region, where 4,189 cases have been reported so far. It also affects 14 provinces in other regions, and taken together, the measures put about 16 million people\u2014about one quarter of Italy's population\u2014under quarantine. The measures are in effect until Apr 3 and also prohibit weddings and funerals and shutter movie theaters, nightclubs, gyms, swimming pools, museums, and ski resorts. Restaurants can remain open limited hours, but customers must sit 3 feet apart.\n  The steps are the strongest any country has taken outside of China. World Health Organization (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, today on Twitter praised Italy's bold steps to slow the spread of the virus. \"They are making genuine sacrifices,\" he said. \"WHO stands in solidarity and is here to continue supporting you.\"\n  Meanwhile, cases rose sharply in other European Countries, with new cases lifting France and Germany over or toward the 1,000-case mark. France reported 177 new cases today, along with 3 new deaths, raising its total to 1,126, including 19 deaths, while Germany's Robert Koch Institute is now reporting 902 cases.\nIran surge continues; number of affected countries passes 100  In the Middle East, Iran's health ministry today reported 743 new cases today, plus 49 more deaths, lifting its totals to 6,566 cases, along with 194 more deaths. The virus has been reported from at least 30 locations, with Tehran, Qom, Gilan, and Isfahan the hardest hit areas.\n  And in Saudi Arabia, the country took two strong steps to curb the spread of the virus. It put the city of Qatif in Eastern Province, where all of the country's 11 cases have been reported, on lockdown, Gulf News reported. The city has a population of about 525,000. It also announced the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country until further notice, Reuters reported today.\n  In Asian developments:South Korea today reported 367 new cases and 6 more deaths, raising its respective totals to 7,134 and 50.\nChina today reported 44 new cases, all but 4 from Hubei province, raising the overall total to 80,695, according to a daily update from the National Health Commission. It also reported 27 more deaths, putting the fatality count at 3,097.\nJapan's health ministry today reported 30 more cases from 6 different prefectures, raising its total to 438 cases. However, it lists its overall total as 487 cases, which includes 49 asymptomatic carriers.\nIn its latest daily update today, the WHO said of 105,856 global COVID-19 cases, 24,727 have been reported from outside of China by 101 countries.\nUS cases approach 500  Meanwhile, the pace of new COVID-19 infections in the United States continued a slow but steady rise, running parallel to increased spread of the virus and increased testing capacity. An online dashboard from Johns Hopkins University this afternoon shows 516 US cases, up by nearly 100 cases from the 417 reported at the same time yesterday. The total includes 49 cases in people repatriated from Wuhan, China, or the Diamond Princess cruise ship that had been quarantined in Japan.\n  At least 34 states have reported cases, according to a New York Times tracker.\n  Washington state officials as of this morning reported 136 cases, up 34 cases from yesterday, and 18 deaths, 2 more since yesterday. Eight counties have reported cases.\n  Of the state's new cases reported today, 12, plus both of the deaths, were reported by Public Health-Seattle and King County, which has now reported 83 of the state's cases. The people who died were both residents of the LifeCare Center, the affected nursing home. They include a woman in her 80s and a man in his 90s.\nFirst cases from four states; totals grow other US hot spots  At least four more states have reported their first cases: Vermont, Missouri, Virginia, and Connecticut. Vermont's case involves an adult with unspecified exposure, Missouri's patient is a resident who traveled to Italy. Virginia's first case, announced yesterday, is a US Marine from Fort Belvoir, and a second case announced today is a Fairfax resident who was on the same Nile River cruise linked to other US cases. Connecticut's first case is a state resident who was likely exposed in California.\n  Also, a handful of already affected states reported more cases, including Oregon, which over the last 2 days reported 11 more cases, raising its total to 14. Also today the state's governor declared a state of emergency, which gives officials the authority to finalize agreements to expand testing to major health systems and prepare to activate the medical reserves corps.\n  In New York, the main hot spot on the East Coast, the state's governor announced 16 more cases today, raising the total to 105. Of those, 82 are from Westchester County, where a large cluster of cases has been detected in New Rochelle. Twelve of the state's cases are from New York City.\n  California's governor also declared a state of emergency today, saying the measure contains provisions to prevent price gouging for necessary supplies. As of yesterday morning, the state had reported 88 cases, 24 from earlier evacuation flights, and 1 death.\n  Chicago officials reported a new case, the seventh from Illinois,  involving a man in his 60s with an unknown exposure source who sought medical care and tested negative for flu.\nCruise ship to disembark in Oakland; feds warns against cruise ship travel, large crowds  California officials announced that they are working with the federal government to safety disembark Grand Princess cruise ship passengers at the port in Oakland as soon as tomorrow. Efforts are already underway to prepare the site. The ship is carrying about 3,500 people, 1,700 of them crew members, from 54 countries.\n  Infected passengers needing acute medical care will be treated at California hospitals, and an additional 1,000 passengers from California will be evaluated in federally run quarantine in California. Nonresidents will be transported to federal facilities in other states.\n  The ship's crew will be quarantined and treated on the ship.\n  In a related development, the US State Department today urged US citizens, especially those with underlying health conditions, to avoid traveling by cruise ships. It said the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has noted an increased risk in travelers and said many countries have implemented strict screening measures, denied ship entries at ports, and prevented passengers from disembarking. It also warned that though the US has evacuated some cruise passengers in recent weeks, those considering cruises should not rely on repatriation flights if they face quarantine by local authorities.\n  Today on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" show, Tony Fauci, MD, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, urged elderly people and those with underlying health conditions to limit their exposure to travel and large crowds.",

Vous confirmez?\n\nEffectivement. Nous avons eu l'information par la repr\u00e9sentation Pays de l' Organisation Mondiale de la Sant\u00e9 (OMS) que le Togo voisin a eu effectivement un cas confirm\u00e9 de Coronavirus. C'est effectivement une dame de 42 ans qui a atterri \u00e0 Cotonou,  qui est rest\u00e9 dans un h\u00f4tel, a vu quelques  parents avant de repartir \u00e0 Lom\u00e9.\n\nPeut-on avoir une id\u00e9e sur les contacts que la dame a eus une fois arriv\u00e9e au B\u00e9nin?\n\nD\u00e8s que nous avons ce genre de cas, nous r\u00e9alisons ce que nous appelons un SitRep, c'est \u00e0 dire une situation report qui nous permet de retracer tout le circuit et d'identifier tous les contacts. Donc, nous avons eu d\u00e9j\u00e0 les contacts t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques des parents au B\u00e9nin et nous sommes en train de les localiser tous parce qu'il faut les tracer tous et tracer tous les contacts qu'ils ont pu avoir \u00e9galement  afin de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la mise en quarantaine et \u00e0 la surveillance pendant 14 jours pour s'assurer qu'ils ne d\u00e9veloppent pas \u00e9galement la maladie. Cela est fait et toutes les \u00e9quipes d'intervention rapide que nous avons au niveau de l'Atlantique et du Littoral ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9ploy\u00e9es d\u00e9j\u00e0 et sont \u00e0 pied d'\u0153uvre pour finaliser totalement le rep\u00e9rage de tous ces cas contacts.\n\nEt la mise en quarantaine interviendra-telle quand?\n\nLa mise en quarantaine a d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9e. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu'on identifie les contacts la mise en quarantaine s'effectue aussit\u00f4t et cela nous permet de contr\u00f4ler la situation et le mouvement de ces personnes.\n\nQuels est la position g\u00e9ographique de ces contacts-l\u00e0 ?\n\nNous avons des contacts essentiellement dans la zone de Calavi. Nous avons un rep\u00e9rage exact de ces contacts et nous retra\u00e7ons de fa\u00e7on excusez-moi polici\u00e8re, (il s'agit de la police de sant\u00e9 publique), l'itin\u00e9raire de ces contacts \u00e9galement pour les retrouver au maximum. Il y a \u00e9galement l'h\u00f4tel o\u00f9 elle a s\u00e9journ\u00e9 o\u00f9 nous avons \u00e9tabli \u00e9galement tous les contacts qu'elle a pu avoir.\n\nComment \u00e9valuer aujourd'hui la fiabilit\u00e9 du dispositif que vous aviez mis en place depuis la survenue de ce virus?\n\nComme vous avez pu le constater le dispositif pour la prise en charge est d\u00e9j\u00e0 en place et d\u00e9j\u00e0 assez solide. Par rapport au rep\u00e9rage des cas \u00e9videmment, comme je l'avais d\u00e9j\u00e0, le reste c'est vraiment de la volont\u00e9 citoyenne de chaque individu d'\u00e9viter de contaminer ses concitoyens. Parce que lorsqu'on a \u00e9t\u00e9 dans un pays \u00e0 risque, en dehors du fait qu'on puisse s'identifier, il faudrait que l'auto-isolement qui est bien expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'a\u00e9roport, avec le plan d'auto-isolement qui est \u00e9tudi\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on  individuelle avec chaque voyageur ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 dans un pays \u00e0 risque, malgr\u00e9 cela parfois, il y a certains qui ne respectent pas ces principes. J'en appelle vraiment \u00e0 l'esprit de responsabilit\u00e9, \u00e0 l'esprit civique de chaque citoyen, de chaque voyageur pour que les mesures qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prescrites par le Gouvernement soient strictement respect\u00e9es.\n\nEt puis la situation au niveau des fronti\u00e8res est quasiment incontr\u00f4lable du fait de la porosit\u00e9 de ces espaces. Qu'est-ce qu'il en est concr\u00e8tement ?\n\nLa situation au niveau des fronti\u00e8res est complexe. C'est vrai que nous avons d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 au niveau de toutes nos fronti\u00e8res terrestres des agents qui sont pr\u00e9sents avec des thermo flash c'est \u00e0 dire des thermom\u00e8tres qui ressemblent \u00e0 des pistolets pour prendre la temp\u00e9rature de fa\u00e7on syst\u00e9matique et proc\u00e9der syst\u00e9matiquement au geste de lavage des mains avec une solution chlor\u00e9e permettant ainsi donc d'habituer ceux qui passent \u00e0 ce geste-l\u00e0. Mais au-del\u00e0 de cela, il faut \u00e9galement reconna\u00eetre que lorsque le sujet n'a pas de signes, tout ce dispositif est inop\u00e9rationnel. Puisqu\u2019apr\u00e8s, il faudra que lorsque le sujet sait qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9, lorsqu'il pr\u00e9sente des signes pour avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 dans une zone \u00e0 risque, qu'il puisse s'identifier et se d\u00e9clarer  au num\u00e9ro du SAMU qui est le 95361102 ou le 95361104 pour qu'on puisse le prendre en charge.\n\nPouvez-vous nous rappeler les conduites \u00e0 tenir par rapport \u00e0 cette crise?\n\nPour les sujets qui sont au niveau du B\u00e9nin, le premier comportement \u00e0 adopter est vraiment le lavage des mains. C'est le geste le plus simple et celui qui va nous pr\u00e9server le plus. Il faut se laver syst\u00e9matiquement les mains \u00e0 l'eau et au savon r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement \u00e0 chaque fois qu'on a effectu\u00e9 un contact, il faut le faire. Il ne faut pas h\u00e9siter \u00e0 le d\u00e9multiplier autant de fois et m\u00eame \u00e0 en devenir parano\u00efaque \u00e0 la limite. Il faut se laver les mains. La deuxi\u00e8me mesure est qu\u2019il faut \u00e9viter de se serrer la main. Il ne faut plus se serrer les mains parce que le contact manuport\u00e9 peut \u00eatre source de transmission des germes. Il faut \u00e9viter lorsqu'on est malade et qu'on tousse, qu'on est enrhum\u00e9 qu'on a des maux de gorge et qu'on a une sensation de fi\u00e8vre apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9 ; il faudrait qu\u2019on se couvre syst\u00e9matiquement la bouche avant d'\u00e9ternuer, soit avec un papier mouchoir soit en portant une bavette qui prot\u00e8ge aussi bien le nez que la bouche et veiller apr\u00e8s \u00e0 \u00e9liminer de fa\u00e7on convenable c'est \u00e0 dire dans une poubelle ces mouchoirs et bavettes. A d\u00e9faut de les avoir \u00e0 port\u00e9e de main, on peut tousser au creux du coude ce qui permet d'\u00e9viter que les mains soient contamin\u00e9es. En dehors de cela, il y a les aliments. Il faut bien cuir tout ce qui est viande, bien cuire tout ce qui est \u0153uf, \u00e9viter de manipuler les animaux sauvages et d'en consommer ces temps-ci. Evidemment et lorsqu'on a \u00e9t\u00e9 dans une zone \u00e0 risque et qu'on revient et qu'au cours du voyage on pr\u00e9sente des signes, il ne faut pas h\u00e9siter. Il faut automatiquement alerter le personnel \u00e0 bord pour se faire d\u2019abord mettre une bavette et pour se faire prendre en charge. Ces mesures concernent les sujets qui sont chez nous. Mais lorsqu\u2019un sujet voyage et revient dans notre pays, il y a des mesures simples \u00e0 prendre. D\u00e9j\u00e0 au niveau du contr\u00f4le de l'a\u00e9roport,  il faut s'auto d\u00e9clarer. M\u00eame si nous avons le manifeste de vol qui nous permet de v\u00e9rifier la provenance de chacun des voyageurs, il faut \u00e9galement avoir ce r\u00e9flexe de pouvoir dire oui effectivement j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 dans tel ou tel pays. \n\nLa deuxi\u00e8me chose lorsqu\u2019on n\u2019est pas pass\u00e9 par l'a\u00e9roport et qu'on est pass\u00e9 par une fronti\u00e8re terrestre et qu'on est entr\u00e9 sur le territoire il y a trois num\u00e9ros qu'on peut appeler. C\u2019est le 95.36.11.07, le 51.02.00.00 et le 51.04.00.00. Lorsqu\u2019on appelle ces num\u00e9ros, on a toutes les informations sur la conduite \u00e0 tenir par rapport au fait qu'on ait pu avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9 en allant dans un pays \u00e0 risque. Et lorsqu'on quitte les points frontaliers et qu'on va chez soi, qu'on se mette en auto-isolement parce que l'auto-isolement est fondamental. Il consiste qui simplement \u00e0 d\u00e9finir un plan pour ne pas aller en contact des autres. \n\nLa derni\u00e8re fois nous avons re\u00e7u quelqu'un qui est venu de Milan. A la maison ils ont deux \u00e9tages. Il s'est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le premier \u00e9tage et les enfants sont en bas. Chacun d\u00e9finit son plan d'auto-isolement de mani\u00e8re individuelle. Et on les accompagne en cela. Les agents de sant\u00e9 vont pour v\u00e9rifier comment cela se passe pendant les 14 jours. Lorsque la fi\u00e8vre vient au cours de cet auto-isolement et qu'on commence par tousser, l\u00e0 alors il faut syst\u00e9matiquement appeler le SAMU au 95.36.11.02, au 95.36.11.04. \n\nNe pas se rendre surtout dans un centre de sant\u00e9 ni dans une pharmacie ni chez un gu\u00e9risseur. On appelle, on s'isole et le SAMU vient vous chercher pour vous emmener au site d\u2019isolement. \n\nCoronavirus, est-ce qu'on peut en gu\u00e9rir?\n\nLe Coronavirus heureusement et c'est cela qui est l'heureuse nouvelle, 85% parmi nous vont le sentir comme un gros rhume que l'immunit\u00e9 naturelle va permettre de gu\u00e9rir naturellement. Il y a 15% qui pour diverses raisons li\u00e9es \u00e0 leur immunit\u00e9 ou qui ont des pathologies qui entra\u00eenent un d\u00e9ficit immunitaire, vont d\u00e9velopper des formes beaucoup plus graves. De tout ce lot, 2 \u00e0 3% aujourd\u2019hui par rapport aux statistiques que nous d\u00e9tenons aujourd'hui vont mourir. En gu\u00e9rir oui et les preuves sont l\u00e0. Il y a 50% de gu\u00e9rison par rapport aux chiffres qui sont enregistr\u00e9s dans le monde. Donc c'est assez rassurant.\n\nUn message pour rassurer nos compatriotes pris de panique et autre?\n\nJe voudrais les rassurer en disant que le Gouvernement a pris la mesure des choses et a mis en place le dispositif qu'il faut pour que nous puissions nous assurer d'une prise en charge correcte. En dehors du site de l'\u00e9cole nationale de police, il y a deux autres sites qui sont en cours de mise en place actuellement \u00e0 Abomey-Calavi et \u00e0 Natitingou. Donc c'est pour avoir une capacit\u00e9 suffisante pour faire face. Il vaut mieux pr\u00e9venir que gu\u00e9rir. En dehors de cela je voudrais les rassurer qu'il faut juste respecter les mesures qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prescrites pour se pr\u00e9munir du Coronavirus Covid-19.\n\n\nJe vous remercie.\n\nhttps://www.gouv.bj/actualite/541/co...tion-au-benin/",

You confirm?\n\nEffectively. We have had information from the Country Representation of the World Health Organization (WHO) that neighboring Togo has indeed had a confirmed case of Coronavirus. It is indeed a 42 year old lady who landed in Cotonou, who stayed in a hotel, saw some parents before leaving for Lom\u00e9.\n\nCan we have an idea about the contacts that the lady had once arrived in Benin?\n\nAs soon as we have this kind of case, we realize what we call a SitRep, ie a report situation which allows us to trace the whole circuit and identify all the contacts. So, we already had the telephone contacts of the parents in Benin and we are in the process of locating them all because we have to trace them all and trace all the contacts they may have had also in order to proceed to quarantine and monitoring for 14 days to make sure they are not also developing the disease. This is done and all the rapid intervention teams that we have at the Atlantic and Littoral level have already been deployed and are on the job to fully finalize the identification of all these contact cases.\n\nAnd when will quarantine take place?\n\nQuarantine has already started. As we identify the contacts, quarantine is carried out immediately and this allows us to control the situation and the movement of these people.\n\nWhat is the geographic position of these contacts?\n\nWe have contacts mainly in the Calavi area. We have an exact location of these contacts and we retrace in an excuse-me police way, (it is the public health police), the route of these contacts also to find them as much as possible. There is also the hotel where she stayed where we also established all the contacts she may have had.\n\nHow to assess today the reliability of the device that you had put in place since the occurrence of this virus?\n\nAs you can see, the support system is already in place and already solid enough. Compared to the identification of cases of course, as I already had, the rest is really the civic will of each individual to avoid contaminating his fellow citizens. Because when you have been in a country at risk, apart from the fact that you can identify yourself, it would be necessary that the self-isolation which is well explained at the airport, with the self-isolation plan which is studied individually with each traveler having been in a country at risk, despite this sometimes, there are some who do not respect these principles. I really appeal to the spirit of responsibility, to the civic spirit of each citizen,\n\nAnd then the situation at the borders is almost uncontrollable because of the porosity of these spaces. What is it in practice?\n\nThe border situation is complex. It is true that we have deployed agents at all of our terrestrial borders who are present with thermo flashes, that is to say thermometers that look like pistols to take the temperature in a systematic way and systematically carry out the washing gesture hands with a chlorine solution thus allowing to accustom those who pass to this gesture. But beyond that, it must also be recognized that when the subject has no signs, this whole device is inoperative. Since afterwards, when the subject knows that he has been exposed, when he shows signs of having been in a risk zone, he must be able to so we can take care of it.\n\nCan you remind us of what to do about this crisis?\n\nFor subjects who are at the level of Benin, the first behavior to adopt is really hand washing. It is the simplest gesture and the one that will preserve us the most. You should always wash your hands with soap and water regularly each time you have made contact, you must do so. Do not hesitate to multiply it as many times and even to become paranoid at the limit. You have to wash your hands. The second measure is to avoid shaking hands . You no longer need to shake hands because the hand-held contact can be a source of transmission of germs. Avoid when you are sick and coughing, that you have a cold, that you have a sore throat and thatwe should systematically cover our mouths before sneezing, either with a tissue or by wearing a bib that protects both the nose and the mouth and then take care to dispose of them properly, ie in a trash can those handkerchiefs and bibs. If you do not have them at hand, you can cough in the crook of the elbow which prevents hands from being contaminated. Apart from that, there is food. You have to cook all that is meat, cook everything that is egg, avoid handling wild animals and consuming them these days. Obviously and when you have been in a risk zone and you come back and during the trip there are signs, you should not hesitate. It is necessary to automatically alert the personnel on board to get a bib first and to be taken care of. These measures concern the subjects that are with us. But when a subject travels and returns to our country, there are simple measures to take. Already at the airport control level, you have to declare yourself. Even if we have the flight manifesto which allows us to verify the origin of each of the travelers, we must also have this reflex to be able to say yes indeed I have been in this or that country. \n\nThe second thing when you have not passed through the airport and you have crossed a land border and entered the territory there are three numbers that you can call. It is 95.36.11.07, 51.02.00.00 and 51.04.00.00. When you call these numbers, you have all the information about what to do with regard to the fact that you may have been exposed while going to a country at risk. And when you leave the border points and go to your home, you put yourself in self-isolation because self-isolation is fundamental. It consists of simply defining a plan so as not to come into contact with others. \n\nThe last time we received someone who came from Milan. At home they have two floors. He has reserved the first floor and the children are downstairs. Everyone defines their self-isolation plan individually. And we accompany them in that. Health workers go to check how it is going for the 14 days. When the fever comes during this self-isolation and we start by coughing, then we must systematically call the SAMU at 95.36.11.02, 95.36.11.04 . \n\nDo not go especially to a health center, a pharmacy or a healer. We call, we isolate ourselves and the SAMU picks you up to take you to the isolation site. \n\nCoronavirus, can we cure it?\n\nFortunately, the Coronavirus is what is the good news, 85% among us will feel it like a big cold that natural immunity will allow to cure naturally. There are 15% who for various reasons related to their immunity or who have pathologies which cause an immune deficiency, will develop much more serious forms. Of this lot, 2 to 3% today compared to the statistics we have today will die. To cure it yes and the proofs are there. There is 50% healing compared to the figures that are recorded in the world. So it's pretty reassuring.\n\nA message to reassure our compatriots panicked and others?\n\nI would like to reassure them by saying that the Government has taken the measure of things and has put in place the necessary mechanism so that we can ensure proper care. Apart from the site of the national police academy, there are two other sites which are currently being set up in Abomey-Calavi and in Natitingou. So it is to have sufficient capacity to cope. Prevention is better than cure. Apart from that I would like to reassure them that you just have to respect the measures that have been prescribed to protect yourself from the Coronavirus Covid-19.\n\n\nThank you.\n\nhttps://www.gouv.bj/actualite/541/co...tion-au-benin/",

This information vacuum reflects very poorly on the CDC and the US government as a whole.\n\nEveryone in the US, including the national media, must derive that information elsewhere, either through hand compilation or reliance on third party data sets. One of the earliest websites to aggregate case counts around the world is the JHUCSSE page put together by a team from Johns Hopkins University (JHU). This page is the source that is often cited for coronavirus statistics, including by the Center Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\nToday, ABC News, citing JHUCSSE home page states:\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\u201cThe number of Americans diagnosed with novel coronavirus is now at least 401, according to a case count by Johns Hopkins.

Although the CDC web page notes it was updated on March 7, 2020, the total number of confirmed and presumptive cases in the US reported by the CDC on that page is only 164, not counting 51 infected US citizens repatriated to the US.\n\nThere are some discrepancies with the case numbers provided by counties from the JHU\u2019S team. For example, at a press conference in New York yesterday, Governor Cuomo confirmed 44 cases in the state of New York, 34 in Westchester County, 4 in New York County, 4 in Nassau County, and 2 in Rockland County. The data table from JHUCSSE records 19 cases in Westchester, 16 in New York, 1 in Nassau and none in Rockland. Given the lack of any central US government agency providing data, such discrepancies are to be expected.\n\nThis is not to disparage the efforts of the team at JHU. They, like all of us, are struggling to understand and enumerate this outbreak. It is the CDC that should be providing accurate and real time updates of the number of and location of cases around the country. It is unfortunate that the CDC is not fulfilling its public mission and that private entities have to step up.",

A similar notification has been emailed to guests who sailed on the previous voyage. For guests who sailed on the previous Grand Princess voyage (Feb 11-21), if you have experienced any symptoms of acute respiratory illness with fever, chills, or cough since your return home, please immediately contact your medical provider. You can also view the COVID-19 information card (PDF) provided by the CDC.  Guests Health Advisory \u2013 Coronavirus\nMarch 4, 2020Dear Princess Guest: \n\nI wish to advise you that today we have been notified by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that they are investigating a small cluster of COVID-19 (coronavirus) cases in Northern California connected to our previous Grand Princess voyage that sailed roundtrip San Francisco from February 11 to February 21. We are working closely with our CDC partners and are following their recommendations.\n\nFor those guests who sailed with us on our previous voyage and may have been exposed, in an abundance of caution, the CDC requires you to remain in your stateroom until you have been contacted and cleared by our medical staff. A member of our medical team will be calling you between the hours of 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM this morning. You may order room service while you wait for the medical screening to be completed, and we apologize for any inconvenience.\n\nPlease be assured that the health, safety, and well-being of all guests and crew are our absolute priority. The CDC is continuing to actively collect information and has set up a meeting with us this morning to determine what, if any, actions need to be taken during this cruise and on arrival in San Francisco. We have shared essential travel and health data with the CDC to facilitate their standard notification to the State and County health authorities to follow up with individuals who may have been exposed to people who became ill.\n\nAs we anticipate that further review of the situation will be necessary on arrival in San Francisco, we will be cancelling the call to Ensenada on Thursday, March 5, in order to sail directly to San Francisco and arrive on Thursday afternoon. We will keep you updated with information as we finalize plans. To assist you in contacting your family, we are providing free internet and phone service. We will advise you if the need arises to make changes to your onward travel plans post-cruise.\n\nCOVID-19 causes mild illness in about 80% of cases, typically with symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath, like the common cold or flu. About 20% of people develop more severe symptoms. The more severe symptoms typically occur in more susceptible individuals that have higher risk factors, such as older adults and those with chronic medical conditions, as it does with regular flu. The illness is mainly spread by droplets from close person-to-person contact. It is possible for the virus to spread by hand touch surfaces, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Updated information on the illness can be found at the CDC website.\n\nAs with all respiratory illnesses, particularly during cold and flu season, you can take steps to reduce your risk of illness:Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds.\nSupplement hand washing by regularly using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\nAvoid close contact with people suffering from respiratory illness.\nCover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze using a tissue or your bent elbow.\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.\n\nWe are closely recording and monitoring all persons who have reported to the medical center with cold and flu symptoms during the voyage. As a precaution, we are also conducting additional enhanced environmental disinfection onboard in addition to our regular stringent cleaning and sanitation protocols.\n\nIf you have experienced any symptoms of acute respiratory illness with fever, chills, or cough at any time during this cruise, and you have not already consulted with the medical staff, please immediately contact the Medical Center to report your illness. There will not be a charge for this service.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this important information. \n\nTo access complimentary internet, turn on your Wi-Fi and access the \u201cocean\u201d network for connection.\n\nYours in health,\n\nGrant Tarling, MD, MPH\nChief Medical Officer\n\nAP \u2013 In-Transit - Guests v1.0  3/4/2020 Family AssistanceIf you are the immediate family of a guest onboard Grand Princess you may call the appropriate number for your region for assistance:\n\nUS and Canada:  +1 888-358-8055\nInternational Number:  +1 872-201-6779\nhttps://www.princess.com/news/notice...s-updates.html",

Of the total, 99 came from hospitals and health centers in Lima and Callao, while the most numerous cases in the provinces correspond to Cusco (9), Tacna (5), La Libertad (4), Arequipa (3), Lambayeque (2 ), Ucayali (2), Iquitos (2) and Huancayo (2). Meanwhile, San Mart\u00edn, Cajamarca and Hu\u00e1nuco reported a probable case each.\n\nIt is worth remembering that the National Institute of Health of the Minsa is the only official and authorized entity for the processing of the samples and delivery of results in Peru and the Minsa is the official source of authorized information on coronavirus in the country, so that content circulating in social networks and other unofficial media should not be considered as true.\n\nThe Minsa recommends to the citizens the frequent washing of hands with soap and water, minimum 20 seconds; cover your nose and mouth with your forearm or tissue when you sneeze or cough; Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands and avoid direct contact with people with respiratory problems.",

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "@tool_pen Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health recommendations to protect our communityPublic Health \u2013 Seattle & King County is taking proactive steps to protect the health of our community by making recommendations that are meant to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in our community and reduce the number of people infected. These steps are recommended to extend through March 31st, 2020. We are continually re-evaluating.\n\nWe understand these actions will have a tremendous impact on the lives of people in our community. Public Health is making these recommendations in consultation with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) based on the best information we have to protect the public\u2019s health. This is a critical moment in the growing outbreak of COVID-19 in King County when such measures can potentially impact the spread of the disease. How the decision to issue these recommendations were madeWe recognize that we are the first in the nation to issue such recommendations, and the decision was not made lightly. Health officials weighed the potential benefits for community health along with the significant impacts that these recommendations could have on our community. In consultation with the CDC, we developed these recommendations based on the rising number of cases in our community and the importance of taking these actions now to reduce further transmission. Guidance for people at higher risk for severe COVID-19 IllnessPublic Health recommends that people at higher risk of severe illness should stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible, including public places with lots of people and large gatherings where there will be close contact with others. This includes concert venues, conventions, sporting events, and crowded social gatherings.\n\nPeople at higher risk include people:Over 60 years of age\nWith underlying health conditions including include heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes\nWith weakened immune systems\nWho are pregnant\n\nCaregivers of children with underlying health conditions should consult with healthcare providers about whether their children should stay home. Anyone who has questions about whether their condition puts them at risk for novel coronavirus should consult with their healthcare providers. Guidance for workplaces and businessesEmployers should take steps to make it more feasible for their employees to work in ways that minimize close contact with large numbers of people.\n\nEmployers should:Maximize telecommuting options for as many employees as possible.\nUrge employees to stay home when they are sick and maximize flexibility in sick leave benefits.\nConsider staggering start and end times to reduce large numbers of people coming together at the same time.\nEvent and community gathering considerationsIf you can feasibly avoid bringing large groups of people together, consider postponing events and gatherings.\n\nIf you can\u2019t avoid bringing groups of people together:Urge anyone who is sick to not attend.\nEncourage those who are at higher risk for coronavirus to not attend.\nTry to find ways to give people more physical space so that they aren\u2019t in close contact as much as possible.\nEncourage attendees to maintain good healthy habits, such as frequent hand washing.\nClean surfaces with standard cleaners.\nGuidance for schoolsPublic Health is not recommending closing schools at this time unless there has been a confirmed case in your school. The reason we are not recommending school closures at this time is because children have not been shown to be a high risk group for serious illness from this virus. In addition, when some schools briefly closed during the H1N1 influenza pandemic, we learned that many children still gathered in group settings and still had exposure to one another. As much as possible, children should be allowed to carry on with their education and normal activities.\n\nPublic Health \u2013Seattle & King County also respects an individual school\u2019s decisions about closures or postponement of activities as each school knows the needs of their community best.\n\nSome children have underlying health conditions, such as weakened immune systems, that put them at higher risk. Caregivers of children with underlying health conditions should consult with healthcare providers about whether their children should stay home. For people who are sickStay home when you are sick. Do not go out in public when you are sick. Avoid medical settings in general unless necessary. If you are ill in any way call your doctor's office first before going in. For general publicEven if you are not ill, avoid visiting hospitals, long term care facilities or nursing homes to the extent possible. If you do need to visit one of these facilities limit your time there and keep 6 feet away from patients.\nDo not go to the emergency room unless essential. Emergency rooms need to be able to serve those with the most critical needs. If you have symptoms like cough, fever, or other respiratory problems, contact your regular doctor first.\nStay home when sick.\nPractice excellent personal hygiene habits, including washing your hands with soap and water frequently, coughing into a tissue or your elbow, and avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.\nStay away from people who are ill, especially if you are at higher risk for coronavirus.\nClean frequently touched surfaces and objects (like doorknobs and light switches). Regular household cleaners are effective.\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth unless you''ve just washed your hands.\nGet plenty of rest, drink plenty of fluids, eat healthy foods, and manage your stress to keep your immunity strong.\nStay informed.

Klein\nMarch 7, 2020 | 1:08pm\n\n...It\u2019s troubling that community spread in Washington state and other parts of the United States \u2014 possibly affecting hundreds to thousands of individuals \u2014 wasn\u2019t detected sooner.\n\nOverregulation of diagnostic testing has played a major role in this delay. For weeks, the CDC operated the nation\u2019s sole diagnostic laboratory for coronavirus, while testing in the rest of the world proceeded apace...\n\n...In theory, doctors could have tested any individuals in whom they suspected coronavirus, and Vice President Mike Pence on March 3rd encouraged this; however, the unavailability of testing has been a major obstacle in practice.\nsee also\nChinese workers head back to work as coronavirus death toll climbs\n\nOn Feb. 4, following Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar\u2019s declaration of a public-health emergency, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the CDC, allowing it to distribute test kits to designated public-health laboratories.\n\nThe CDC began shipping the kits on Feb. 5, but laboratories could not validate them because they contained a defective reagent.\n\nLaboratory tests typically contain what is termed a \u201cnegative control\u201d \u2014 material expected to yield a negative result when tested, and which protects against false-positive results stemming from contamination or other issues. Many labs obtained positive results with the negative controls, invalidating test runs and precluding use of the kits. Affected labs were required to send their specimens to the overburdened CDC.\n\nThe FDA has not allowed the experienced and highly skilled professionals at public-health, academic and commercial laboratories to set up their own laboratory developed tests (LDTs), and no manufactured test kits have been authorized for sale in the US. In Europe, several companies, at least one US-based, have regulatory approval to sell test kits there.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s regulation of laboratory tests has been a longstanding concern. This includes moves to regulate LDTs, despite the existence of stringent alternative-regulatory and oversight mechanisms. In general, the FDA has exercised \u201cenforcement discretion\u201d with respect to LDTs. With coronavirus testing, the FDA\u2019s abandonment of enforcement discretion may have proved deadly...",

[Epub ahead of print]  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Role of Chest CT in Diagnosis and Management.Li Y1, Xia L1.\nAuthor informationAbstract OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to determine the misdiagnosis rate of radiologists for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. The CT features of COVID-19 are reported and compared with the CT features of other viruses to familiarize radiologists with possible CT patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This study included the first 51 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing (23 women and 28 men; age range, 26-83 years) and two patients with adenovirus (one woman and one man; ages, 58 and 66 years). We reviewed the clinical information, CT images, and corresponding image reports of these 53 patients. The CT images included images from 99 chest CT examinations, including initial and follow-up CT studies. We compared the image reports of the initial CT study with the laboratory test results and identified CT patterns suggestive of viral infection. RESULTS. COVID-19 was misdiagnosed as a common infection at the initial CT study in two inpatients with underlying disease and COVID-19. Viral pneumonia was correctly diagnosed at the initial CT study in the remaining 49 patients with COVID-19 and two patients with adenovirus. These patients were isolated and obtained treatment. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation with or without vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram sign are common CT features of COVID-19. The The \"reversed halo\" sign and pulmonary nodules with a halo sign are uncommon CT features. The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of adenovirus infection. There are differences as well as similarities in the CT features of COVID-19 compared with those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome. CONCLUSION. We found that chest CT had a low rate of missed diagnosis of COVID-19 (3.9%, 2/51) and may be useful as a standard method for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to optimize the management of patients. However, CT is still limited for identifying specific viruses and distinguishing between viruses.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  CT; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); infectious diseases; lung disease\n\n PMID: \t32130038 \tDOI: \t10.2214/AJR.20.22954",

The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China is striking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between chest CT findings and the clinical conditions of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years old accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). Lesions present on CT images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%]) and multifocal (55 [54.5%]). Patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease. CONCLUSION. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation of the severity and extent of disease. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have GGO or mixed GGO and consolidation and vascular enlargement in the lesion. Lesions are more likely to have peripheral distribution and bilateral involvement and be lower lung predominant and multifocal. CT involvement score can help in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  COVID-19; CT; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus disease; pneumonia\n\n PMID: \t32125873 \tDOI: \t10.2214/AJR.20.22976",

[Epub ahead of print]  Angiotensin receptor blockers as tentative SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.Gurwitz D1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   At the time of writing this commentary (February 2020), the coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic has already resulted in more fatalities compared with the SARS and MERS coronavirus epidemics combined. Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed. Developing vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may take many months. Moreover, vaccines based on viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.\n  \u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  AT1R blockers; COVID-19 epidemic; SARS-CoV-2; angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); losartan\n\n PMID: \t32129518 \tDOI: \t10.1002/ddr.21656",

Methods: This study was a retrospective study. A total of 7 patients with Heart failure and 12 patients with COVID-19 in the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between December 1, 2019 and February 15, 2020 were enrolled. The baseline clinical and imaging features of the two groups were statistically analyzed. Results: There was no significant difference in age and sex between the two groups, but the incidence of epidemiological contact history, fever or respiratory symptoms in the COVID-19 group was significantly higher than that in the heart failure group (12/12 vs. 2/7, P=0.001; 12/12 vs. 4/7, P<0.001). While the proportion of cardiovascular diseases and impaired cardiac function was significantly less than that of the heart failure group(2/12 vs.7/7, P<0.001; 0/12 vs.7/7, P<0.001). For imaging features, both groups had ground-glass opacity and thickening of interlobular septum, but the ratio of central and gradient distribution was higher in patients with heart failure than that in patients with COVID-19 (4/7 vs. 1/12, P=0.04). In heart failure group, the ratio of the expansion of small pulmonary veins was also higher (3/7 vs. 0, P=0.013), and the lung lesions can be significantly improved after effective anti-heart failure treatment. Besides, there are more disease with rounded morphology in COVID-19 (9/12 vs. 2/7, P=0.048) . Conclusions: More patients with COVID-19 have epidemiological history and fever or respiratory symptoms. There are significant differences in chest CT features, such as enlargement of pulmonary veins, lesions distribution and morphology between heart failure and COVID-19.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  COVID-19; Heart failure; Pulmonary computed tomography\n\n PMID: \t32129583 \tDOI: \t10.3760/cma.j.cn112148-20200218-00093",

It is still unclear how fast the virus evolved and how the virus interacts with other microorganisms in the lung.\nMETHODS:  We have conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of eight SARS-CoV-2 patients, 25 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients, and 20 healthy controls.\nRESULTS:  The median number of intra-host variants was 1-4 in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, which ranged between 0 and 51 in different samples. The distribution of variants on genes was similar to those observed in the population data (110 sequences). However, very few intra-host variants were observed in the population as polymorphism, implying either a bottleneck or purifying selection involved in the transmission of the virus, or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism data. Although current evidence did not support the transmission of intra-host variants in a person-to-person spread, the risk should not be overlooked. The microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was similar to those in CAP, either dominated by the pathogens or with elevated levels of oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria.\nCONCLUSION:  SARS-CoV-2 evolves in vivo after infection, which may affect its virulence, infectivity, and transmissibility. Although how the intra-host variant spreads in the population is still elusive, it is necessary to strengthen the surveillance of the viral evolution in the population and associated clinical changes.\n  \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

Optimization Method for Forecasting Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 in China.Al-Qaness MAA1, Ewees AA2,3, Fan H1, Abd El Aziz M4.\nAuthor informationAbstract   In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, called COVID-19, was discovered in Wuhan, China, and has spread to different cities in China as well as to 24 other countries. The number of confirmed cases is increasing daily and reached 34,598 on 8 February 2020. In the current study, we present a new forecasting model to estimate and forecast the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the upcoming ten days based on the previously confirmed cases recorded in China. The proposed model is an improved adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) using an enhanced flower pollination algorithm (FPA) by using the salp swarm algorithm (SSA). In general, SSA is employed to improve FPA to avoid its drawbacks (i.e., getting trapped at the local optima). The main idea of the proposed model, called FPASSA-ANFIS, is to improve the performance of ANFIS by determining the parameters of ANFIS using FPASSA. The FPASSA-ANFIS model is evaluated using the World Health Organization (WHO) official data of the outbreak of the COVID-19 to forecast the confirmed cases of the upcoming ten days. More so, the FPASSA-ANFIS model is compared to several existing models, and it showed better performance in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), coefficient of determination ( R 2 ), and computing time. Furthermore, we tested the proposed model using two different datasets of weekly influenza confirmed cases in two countries, namely the USA and China. The outcomes also showed good performances.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  COVID-19; adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS); flower pollination algorithm (FPA); forecasting; salp swarm algorithm (SSA)\n\n PMID: \t32131537 \tDOI: \t10.3390/jcm9030674",

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk while combating COVID-19 at the very frontline, and nosocomial outbreaks among HCWs are not unusual in similar settings; the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak led to over 966 HCW infections with 1.4% deaths in mainland China [2]. As of 11 February 2020, 3019 HCWs might have been infected with 2019-nCov in China, 1716 HCW cases were confirmed by nucleic acid testing[3], and at least 6 HCWs died, including the famous whistleblower Dr Li Wenliang. In view of this severe situation, we are recommending urgent interventions to help to protect HCWs.\n\n\n PMID: \t32131906 \tDOI: \t10.1017/ice.2020.60",

Epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases, environmental and air samples were collected and analyzed.\nRESULTS:  From day 1 to day 42, forty-two (3.3%) of 1275 patients fulfilling active (n=29) and enhanced laboratory surveillance (n=13) confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. The number of locally acquired case significantly increased from 1 (7.7%) of 13 [day 22 to day 32] to 27 (93.1%) of 29 confirmed case [day 33 to day 42] (p<0.001). Twenty-eight patients (66.6%) came from 8 family clusters. Eleven (2.7%) of 413 HCWs caring these confirmed cases were found to have unprotected exposure requiring quarantine for 14 days. None of them was infected and nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was not observed. Environmental surveillance performed in a patient with viral load of 3.3x106 copies/ml (pooled nasopharyngeal/ throat swab) and 5.9x106 copies/ml (saliva) respectively. SARS-CoV-2 revealed in 1 (7.7%) of 13 environmental samples, but not in 8 air samples collected at a distance of 10 cm from patient's chin with or without wearing a surgical mask.\nCONCLUSION:  Appropriate hospital infection control measures could prevent nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\n PMID: \t32131908 \tDOI: \t10.1017/ice.2020.58",

Here we present cryo-EM structures of full-length human ACE2, in the presence of a neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1, with or without the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2, both at an overall resolution of 2.9 \u00c5, with a local resolution of 3.5 \u00c5 at the ACE2-RBD interface. The ACE2-B0AT1 complex is assembled as a dimer of heterodimers, with the Collectrin-like domain (CLD) of ACE2 mediating homo-dimerization. The RBD is recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2 mainly through polar residues. These findings provide important insights to the molecular basis for coronavirus recognition and infection.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020, American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\n PMID: \t32132184 \tDOI: \t10.1126/science.abb2762",

Subsequent investigations identified a novel coronavirus, now named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from the affected patients. Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are important for controlling the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2-associated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. In this study, we developed and compared the performance of three novel real-time RT-PCR assays targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/helicase (Hel), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 with that of the reported RdRp-P2 assay which is used in >30 European laboratories. Among the three novel assays, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro (1.8 TCID50/ml with genomic RNA and 11.2 RNA copies/reaction with in vitro RNA transcripts). Among 273 specimens from 15 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 77 (28.2%) were positive by both the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and RdRp-P2 assays. The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was positive for an additional 42 RdRd-P2-negative specimens [119/273 (43.6%) vs 77/273 (28.2%), P<0.001], including 29/120 (24.2%) respiratory tract specimens and 13/153 (8.5%) non-respiratory tract specimens. The mean viral load of these specimens was 3.21\u00d7104 RNA copies/ml (range, 2.21\u00d7102 to 4.71\u00d7105 RNA copies/ml). The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay did not cross-react with other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory pathogens in cell culture and clinical specimens, whereas the RdRp-P2 assay cross-reacted with SARS-CoV in cell culture. The highly sensitive and specific COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay may help to improve the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 American Society for Microbiology.\n\n\n PMID: \t32132196 \tDOI: \t10.1128/JCM.00310-20",

The Effects of Social Support on Sleep Quality of Medical Staff Treating Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in January and February 2020 in China.Xiao H1, Zhang Y2, Kong D2, Li S3, Yang N2.\nAuthor informationAbstract   BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), formerly known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate analysis method to determine the structural relationship between measured variables. This observational study aimed to use SEM to determine the effects of social support on sleep quality and function of medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 in January and February 2020 in Wuhan, China. MATERIAL AND METHODS A one-month cross-sectional observational study included 180 medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 infection. Levels of anxiety, self-efficacy, stress, sleep quality, and social support were measured using the and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Social Support Rate Scale (SSRS), respectively. Pearson's correlation analysis and SEM identified the interactions between these factors. RESULTS Levels of social support for medical staff were significantly associated with self-efficacy and sleep quality and negatively associated with the degree of anxiety and stress. Levels of anxiety were significantly associated with the levels of stress, which negatively impacted self-efficacy and sleep quality. Anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy were mediating variables associated with social support and sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS SEM showed that medical staff in China who were treating patients with COVID-19 infection during January and February 2020 had levels of anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy that were dependent on sleep quality and social support.\n\n\n PMID: \t32132521 \tDOI: \t10.12659/MSM.923549",

Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R 0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of R t . In the first assumption, R t was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with R t \u2009=\u20091.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, R t was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (R t \u2009=\u20093.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (R t \u2009=\u20090.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce R t to an ideal level and control the infection.\n  \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Autoimmunity; Immunology\n\n PMID: \t32133152 \tPMCID: \tPMC7039910 \tDOI: \t10.1038/s41421-020-0148-0",

However, the false-positive rate of positive results in the screening has not been reported up to now. But to clearify the false-positive rate during screening is important in COVID-19 control and prevention. Methods: Point values and reasonable ranges of the indicators which impact the false-positive rate of positive results were estimated based on the information available to us at present. The false-positive rate of positive results in the active screening was deduced, and univariate and multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to understand the robustness of the findings. Results: When the infection rate of the close contacts and the sensitivity and specificity of reported results were taken as the point estimates, the positive predictive value of the active screening was only 19.67%, in contrast, the false-positive rate of positive results was 80.33%. The multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analysis results supported the base-case findings, with a 75% probability for the false-positive rate of positive results over 47%. Conclusions: In the close contacts of COVID-19 patients, nearly half or even more of the 'asymptomatic infected individuals' reported in the active nucleic acid test screening might be false positives.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  COVID-19; Close contacts; False-positive; Nucleic acid test; Screening\n\n PMID: \t32133832 \tDOI: \t10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200221-00144",

Methods: Baseline demographics and clinicopathological data of eligible patients were retrieved from medical records. Information of clinical manifestations, history of epidemiology, lab tests and chest CT scan images of visiting patients from February 13 to February 28 were collected. Literatures about pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients were searched from databases including PUBMED, EMBASE and CNKI. Results: Among the 139 cancer patients underwent chest CT scans before chemotherapy, pulmonary infiltrates were identified in eight patients (5.8%), five of whom were characterized as GGOs in lungs. 2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing was performed in three patients and the results were negative. One case was a 66-year-old man diagnosed as non-Hodgkin lymphoma and underwent CHOP chemotherapy regimen. His chest CT scan image displayed multiple GGOs in lungs and the complete blood count showed decreased lymphocytes. This patient denied any contact with confirmed/suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection and without fever and other respiratory symptoms. Considering the negative result of nuclear acid testing, this patient was presumptively diagnosed as viral pneumonia and an experiential anti-infection treatment had been prescribed for him. Conclusions: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) complicates the clinical scenario of pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients. The epidemic history, clinical manifestation, CT scan image and lab test should be combined consideration. The 2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing might be applicated in more selected patients. Active anti-infection treatment and surveillance of patient condition should be initiated if infectious disease is considered.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  COVID-19; Drug-induced pulmonary injury; Neoplasm; Pulmonary infiltrates; Viral pneumonia\n\n PMID: \t32133833 \tDOI: \t10.3760/cma.j.cn112152-20200303-00166",

[Epub ahead of print]  Unique epidemiological and clinical features of the emerging 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) implicate special control measures.Wang Y1, Wang Y1, Chen Y2, Qin Q1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   By Feb 27th , 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 caused 82623 confirmed cases and 2858 deaths globally, more than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (8273 cases, 775 deaths) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (1139 cases, 431 deaths) caused in 2003 and 2013 respectively. COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries internationally. Total fatality rate of COVID-19 is estimated at 3.46% by far based on published data from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). Average incubation period of COVID-19 is around 6.4 days, ranges from 0-24 days. The basic reproductive number (R0 ) of COVID-19 ranges from 2-3.5 at the early phase regardless of different prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS. A study from China CDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing the spread of COVID-19. Nosocomial transmission was another severe problem. 3019 health workers were infected by Feb 12, 2020, which accounted for 3.83% of total number of infections, and extremely burdened the health system, especially in Wuhan. Limited epidemiological and clinical data suggest that the disease spectrum of COVID-19 may differ from SARS or MERS. We summarize latest literatures on genetic, epidemiological, and clinical features of COVID-19 in comparison to SARS and MERS and emphasize special measures on diagnosis and potential interventions. This review will improve our understanding of the unique features of COVID-19 and enhance our control measures in the future. This article is protected by copyright.

The clinical and laboratory information was obtained from inpatient records. All the patients were undergone chest CT in our hospital.\nRESULTS:  Thirteen pediatric patients (13/20, 65%) had an identified history of close contact with COVID-19 diagnosed family members. Fever (12/20, 60%) and cough (13/20, 65%) were the most common symptoms. For laboratory findings, procalcitonin elevation (16/20, 80%) should be pay attention to, which is not common in adults. Coinfection (8/20, 40%) is common in pediatric patients. A total of 6 patients presented with unilateral pulmonary lesions (6/20, 30%), 10 with bilateral pulmonary lesions (10/20, 50%), and 4 cases showed no abnormality on chest CT (4/20, 20%). Consolidation with surrounding halo sign was observed in 10 patients (10/20, 50%), ground-glass opacities were observed in 12 patients (12/20, 60%), fine mesh shadow was observed in 4 patients (4/20, 20%), and tiny nodules were observed in 3 patients (3/20, 15%).\nCONCLUSION:  Procalcitonin elevation and consolidation with surrounding halo signs were common in pediatric patients which were different from adults.

[Epub ahead of print]  Perspectives on monoclonal antibody therapy as potential therapeutic intervention for Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).Shanmugaraj B1,2, Siriwattananon K1,2, Wangkanont K3, Phoolcharoen W1,2.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Last decade witnessed the outbreak of many life-threatening human pathogens including Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and more recently novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2). The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging pathogen.\n\n\n PMID: \t32134278 \tDOI: \t10.12932/AP-200220-0773",

[Epub ahead of print]  CT Features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia in 62 Patients in Wuhan, China.Zhou S1, Wang Y1, Zhu T1, Xia L1.\nAuthor informationAbstract OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate 62 subjects in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia and describe the CT features of this epidemic disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective study of 62 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was performed. CT images and clinical data were reviewed. Two thoracic radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT signs of the lesions and also scored the extent of involvement of the CT signs. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare lesion distribution and CT scores. The chi-square test was used to compare the CT signs of early-phase versus advanced-phase COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS. A total of 62 patients (39 men and 23 women; mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 52.8 \u00b1 12.2 years; range, 30-77 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Twenty-four of 30 patients who underwent routine blood tests (80.0%) had a decreased lymphocyte count. Of 27 patients who had their erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level assessed, 18 (66.7%) had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and all 27 (100.0%) had an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. Multiple lesions were seen on the initial CT scan of 52 of 62 patients (83.9%). Forty-eight of 62 patients (77.4%) had predominantly peripheral distribution of lesions. The mean CT score for the upper zone (3.0 \u00b1 3.4) was significantly lower than that for the middle (4.5 \u00b1 3.8) and lower (4.5 \u00b1 3.7) zones (p = 0.022 and p = 0.020, respectively), and there was no significant difference in the mean CT score of the middle and lower zones (p = 1.00). The mean CT score for the anterior area (4.4 \u00b1 4.1) was significantly lower than that for the posterior area (7.7 \u00b1 6.3) (p = 0.003). CT findings for the patients were as follows: 25 patients (40.3%) had ground-glass opacities (GGO), 21 (33.9%), consolidation; 39 (62.9%), GGO plus a reticular pattern; 34 (54.8%), vacuolar sign; 28 (45.2%), microvascular dilation sign; 35 (56.5%), fibrotic streaks; 21 (33.9%), a subpleural line; and 33 (53.2%), a subpleural transparent line. With regard to bronchial changes seen on CT, 45 patients (72.6%) had air bronchogram, and 11 (17.7%) had bronchus distortion. In terms of pleural changes, CT showed that 30 patients (48.4%) had pleural thickening, 35 (56.5%) had pleural retraction sign, and six (9.7%) had pleural effusion. Compared with early-phase disease (\u2264 7 days after the onset of symptoms), advanced-phase disease (8-14 days after the onset of symptoms) was characterized by significantly increased frequencies of GGO plus a reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, fibrotic streaks, a subpleural line, a subpleural transparent line, air bronchogram, bronchus distortion, and pleural effusion; however, GGO significantly decreased in advanced-phase disease. CONCLUSION. CT examination of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed a mixed and diverse pattern with both lung parenchyma and the interstitium involved. Identification of GGO and a single lesion on the initial CT scan suggested early-phase disease. CT signs of aggravation and repair coexisted in advanced-phase disease. Lesions presented with a characteristic multifocal distribution in the middle and lower lung regions and in the posterior lung area. A decreased lymphocyte count and an increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level were the most common laboratory findings.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  COVID-19; CT; coronavirus disease 2019; pneumonia\n\n PMID: \t32134681 \tDOI: \t10.2214/AJR.20.22975",

We aimed to quantify severity of COVID-19 infection on High-Resolution CT and to determine its relationship with clinical parameters.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:  From Jan 11, 2020, to Feb 5, 2020, the clinical, laboratory and HRCT features of 42 patients (26-75 years, 25 males) with COVID-19 were analyzed. The initial and follow-up CT obtained a mean of 4.5 days and 11.6 days from the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the severity and progression of pneumonia. Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT features and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis.\nRESULTS:  Thirty-five (83%) patients exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset. Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial thickening, fibrous strips and air bronchograms, compared to initial CT (all p<0.05). Before regular treatments, there was a moderate correlation between the days from onset and sum score of opacifications (R=0.68, p<0.01). The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia assessed on initial CT (R range 0.36-0.75, p<0.05). The highest temperature and the severity of opacifications assessed on initial CT were significantly related to the progression of opacifications on follow-up CT (p=0.001-0.04).\nCONCLUSIONS:  Patients with the COVID-19 infection usually presented with typical ground-grass opacities and other CT features, which showed significant correlations with some clinical and laboratory measurements. Follow-up CT images often demonstrated progressions during the early stage from illness onset.\n\n\n PMID: \t32134800 \tDOI: \t10.1097/RLI.0000000000000674",

The disease spread widely in China, and, as of February 26, 2020, COVID-19 cases had been identified in 36 other countries and territories, including the United States. Person-to-person transmission has been widely documented, and a limited number of countries have reported sustained person-to-person spread.* On January 20, state and local health departments in the United States, in collaboration with teams deployed from CDC, began identifying and monitoring all persons considered to have had close contact\u2020 with patients with confirmed COVID-19 (2). The aims of these efforts were to ensure rapid evaluation and care of patients, limit further transmission, and better understand risk factors for transmission.\n\n\n PMID: \t32134909 \tDOI: \t10.15585/mmwr.mm6909e1",

Characteristics of Seasonal Influenza Virus Activity in a Subtropical City in China, 2013-2019.Zhu A1, Liu J2, Ye C3, Yu J1, Peng Z1, Feng L1, Wang L1, Qin Y1, Zheng Y1, Li Z1.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  To optimize seasonal influenza vaccination programs in regions with potentially complicated seasonal patterns, the epidemiological characteristics of seasonal influenza activity in a subtropical city of China were explored.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:  Influenza virus data of patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) during 2013-2019 were collected from two sentinel hospitals in a subtropical region of China, Yichang city. The influenza virus positive rate among sampled ILI cases served as a proxy to estimate influenza seasonal characteristics, including periodicity, duration, peaks, and predominant subtypes/lineages. Epidemiological features of different years, seasons and age groups were analyzed, and vaccine mismatches were identified.\nRESULTS:  In total, 8693 ILI cases were included; 1439 (16.6%) were laboratory-confirmed influenza cases. The influenza A positive rate (10.6%) was higher than the influenza B positive rate (5.9%). There were three influenza circulation patterns in Yichang: (1) annual periodicity (in 2013-2014, 2015-2016 and 2018-2019), (2) semiannual periodicity (in 2014-2015), and (3) year-round periodicity (in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018). Summer epidemics existed in two of the six years and were dominated by influenza A/H3N2. Winter and spring epidemics occurred in five of the six years, and A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata were codominant. During the study period, the predominant lineages, B/Victoria in 2015-16 and B/Yamagata in 2017-2018, were both mismatched with the influenza B component of the trivalent vaccine. Children 5-14 years old (26.4%) and individuals over 60 years old (16.9%) had the highest influenza positive rates.\nCONCLUSIONS:  The seasonal epidemic period and the predominant subtype/lineage of influenza viruses in Yichang city are complex. Influenza vaccination timing and strategies need to be optimized according to the local features of influenza virus activity.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  influenza; seasonality; subtropical city\n\n PMID: \t32121519 \tDOI: \t10.3390/vaccines8010108 \n  Free full text",

Influenza A Virus Antibodies with Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity Function.Gao R1, Sheng Z2, Sreenivasan CC1, Wang D1, Li F1,3.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Influenza causes millions of cases of hospitalizations annually and remains a public health concern on a global scale. Vaccines are developed and have proven to be the most effective countermeasures against influenza infection. Their efficacy has been largely evaluated by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) titers exhibited by vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies, which correlate fairly well with vaccine-conferred protection. Contrarily, non-neutralizing antibodies and their therapeutic potential are less well defined, yet, recent advances in anti-influenza antibody research indicate that non-neutralizing Fc-effector activities, especially antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), also serve as a critical mechanism in antibody-mediated anti-influenza host response. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with Fc-effector activities have the potential for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of influenza infection. Inducing mAbs mediated Fc-effector functions could be a complementary or alternative approach to the existing neutralizing antibody-based prevention and therapy. This review mainly discusses recent advances in Fc-effector functions, especially ADCC and their potential role in influenza countermeasures. Considering the complexity of anti-influenza approaches, future vaccines may need a cocktail of immunogens in order to elicit antibodies with broad-spectrum protection via multiple protective mechanisms.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Fc effector activities; antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC); influenza; non-neutralizing monoclonal antibody\n\n PMID: \t32121563 \tDOI: \t10.3390/v12030276 \n  Free full text",

Effect of Influenza Vaccination on Mortality and Risk of Hospitalization in Elderly Individuals with and without Disabilities: A Nationwide, Population-Based Cohort Study.Chang YC1,2, Tung HJ3, Huang YT4, Lu CT5, Ernawaty E6, Wu SY1,7,8,9.\nAuthor informationAbstract Purpose: The effects of influenza vaccines are unclear for elderly individuals with disabilities. We use a population-based cohort study to estimate the effects of influenza vaccines in elderly individuals with and without disabilities. Methods: Data were taken from the National Health Insurance Research Database and Disabled Population Profile of Taiwan. A total of 2,741,403 adults aged 65 or older were identified and 394,490 were people with a disability. These two groups were further divided into those who had or had not received an influenza vaccine. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to compare the relative risks (RRs) of death and hospitalization across the four groups. Results: 30.78% elderly individuals without a disability and 34.59% elderly individuals with a disability had vaccinated for influenza. Compared to the unvaccinated elderly without a disability, the vaccinated elderly without a disability had significantly lower risks in all-cause mortality (RR = 0.64) and hospitalization for any of the influenza-related diseases (RR = 0.91). Both the unvaccinated and vaccinated elderly with a disability had significantly higher risks in all-cause mortality (RR = 1.81 and 1.18, respectively) and hospitalization for any of the influenza-related diseases (RR = 1.73 and 1.59, respectively). Conclusions: The elderly with a disability had higher risks in mortality and hospitalization than those without a disability; however, receiving influenza vaccinations could still generate more protection to the disabled elderly.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Influenza vaccination; disability; elderly; hospitalization; mortality\n\n PMID: \t32121645 \tDOI: \t10.3390/vaccines8010112 \n  Free full text",

The Charit\u00e9 children's intensive care unit is also affected. The Charit\u00e9 denied rbb research after an entire truckload of respiratory masks was stolen.\n\nLarge quantities of disinfectants, respiratory masks, gloves and protective clothing have been stolen from the children's intensive care unit of the Charit\u00e9 Virchow Clinic. A ward is affected where children with severe cancer are treated. The Charit\u00e9 press office confirmed this at the request of rbb | 24. \"As a reaction, internal precautions have been taken to prevent this from happening again,\" the press office said.\n\nThe BZ had first reported the theft. According to this, the board of health care informed the employees by email that this was unacceptable. The thefts could affect the patient.    Charit\u00e9 rejects report on truck theftA spokeswoman for the Berlin Charit\u00e9 denied on Friday evening that a full truck load with respiratory masks had been stolen. The rbb had previously learned this from Charit\u00e9 circles, combined with the warning that the theft on a large scale would make work in various wards difficult and endanger patients from Monday. The Charit\u00e9 spokeswoman also rejected this as wrong.  Protective materials are becoming increasingly scarce in clinicsDisinfectants and protective masks have also been stolen in isolated cases in the city's Vivantes clinics, writes the press office on request from rbb. The Vivantes employees were therefore called upon to be more mindful. The thefts are out of time - because due to nationwide delivery difficulties, the protective material is becoming increasingly scarce.\n\n\"Employees are required to ensure that disposable items such as masks, coats or safety glasses are used in a way that conserves resources,\" emphasizes the press office.\n\nIn the four DRK clinics in Berlin they have gone one step further to prevent theft. The publicly available dispensers for disinfectants are now only filled with soap, says a spokeswoman. Previously, unknowns had pumped disinfectants into the bottles they had brought with them. Entire containers were even removed from the publicly accessible toilet.\n\nBought for 60 cents - sold for 20 euros eachThose who wear a respirator may feel safer these days. However, according to the Federal Ministry of Health, there is no scientific evidence that a face mask significantly reduces the risk of infection with corona virus.\n\nIn many Berlin pharmacies, respiratory masks and disinfectants are still sold out. Wholesalers of respiratory masks such as the company DACH protective clothing are also increasingly experiencing delivery difficulties. \"We have not served new commercial customers since the outbreak of the Corona crisis,\" says a hotline employee on the phone.\n\nThe result: Respirators are traded at exorbitant prices in online shops. A 24-year-old reported to the online magazine bento that he had speculated on the corona crisis and had already bought breathing masks on a large scale in January. Most of the time he paid less than 60 cents a piece, he sold them for more than 20 euros. Overall, he had generated more than a million euros in sales.\n\n\nStories like this may have contributed to stealing hygiene items in clinics.\n\nhttps://www.rbb24.de/panorama/thema/...gestohlen.html",

Exploring a new strategy for manufacturing and delivering a safe and effective H7N9 vaccine is needed urgently.\nRESULTS:  An alternative approach is to develop an influenza H7N9 oral vaccine based on yeast display technology in a timely manner. Hemagglutinin (HA) of A/Anhui/1/2013 (AH-H7N9) is used as a model antigen and characterized its expression on the surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S.cerevisiae) EBY 100. Mice administrated orally with S.cerevisiae EBY100/pYD5-HA produced significant titers of IgG antibody as well as significant amounts of cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4. Importantly, S.cerevisiae EBY100/pYD5-HA could provide effective immune protection against homologous A/Anhui/1/2013 (AH-H7N9) virus challenge.\nCONCLUSIONS:  Our findings suggest that platform based on yeast surface technology provides an alternative approach to prepare a promising influenza H7N9 oral vaccine candidate that can significantly shorten the preparedness period and result in effective protection against influenza A pandemic.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Influenza A pandemic; S.cerevisiae EBY100/pYD5-HA; Yeast display technology\n\n PMID: \t32122351 \tDOI: \t10.1186/s12934-020-01316-1 \n  Free full text",

Pandemics are unpredictable, but the threat is imminent. Therefore, pandemic preparedness, which includes full simulation exercises, is a key to reduce this threat. Responding to the challenges, Ministry of Health (MoH) Indonesia adopted WHO pandemic risk management guideline, developed contingency plan and conducted full scale epicenter influenza pandemic simulation.\nMETHOD:  The exercise outlines the Government of Indonesia operational plans for Avian Influenza (AI) control from the detection of AI cases (from poultry to human transmission) and containment of human to human transmission of novel influenza virus in influenza pandemic epicenter at Setu village South Tangerang. The simulation covers multiple locations in community, hospitals, point of entry and live bird market. 25 evaluators and around 800 observers involved in the exercise.\nRESULTS:  The full scale pandemic epicenter containment exercise has demonstrated Indonesia capacity in whole of society approach pandemic risk management in the overall national emergency response framework, covering command and coordination, animal health response surveillance, medical response, laboratory, risk communication, perimeter control, pharmaceutical interventions, non-pharmaceutical interventions and civil-military interoperability. It is served as a momentum to improve multisector commitment on pandemic preparedness. The outcome of this exercise has contributed to identification of gaps that require further strengthening of IHR core capacities in the country to reduce the threat of the next influenza pandemic.\nCONCLUSION:  There is also a critical need for more evidence-based strategies and policy formulation to strengthen pandemic preparedness.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

Suspension of the national paediatric influenza vaccination programme as a result of the passive adverse events surveillance operating at the time did not occur until 23 April 2010.\nCONCLUSIONS:  Active vaccine safety surveillance leading to rapid detection of a safety signal would likely have resulted in earlier suspension of Fluvax from the vaccination programme, prevention of many febrile convulsions and maintenance of public confidence in influenza vaccination for young children.\n  \u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

[Epub ahead of print]  H5 Influenza Viruses in Egypt.El-Shesheny R1,2, Kandeil A2, Mostafa A2, Ali MA2, Webby RJ1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   For almost a decade, Egypt has been endemic for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses. In addition to being catastrophic for poultry production, A(H5N1) has also caused 359 human infections in the country (\u223c40% of global cases), with 120 being fatal. From 2017, A(H5N1) viruses have been gradually replaced by HPAI A(H5N8) viruses seeded from Southeast Asia through Europe; no human cases have been reported since. This lack of human cases is not a consequence of fewer H5 infections in poultry. Despite governmental outbreak control, the number of avian influenza outbreaks has increased since 2006 partially fueled by noncompliance with preventive measures and suboptimal vaccination programs. Adherence to control measures is low because of social norms, especially among women and children-the main caretakers of household flocks in rural areas-and declining public awareness in the community. Egypt has thus become an epicenter for A(H5) virus evolution, with no clear resolution in sight.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.\n\n\n PMID: \t32122919 \tDOI: \t10.1101/cshperspect.a038745",

Despite an abundance of small-scale observational studies, the role of the poultry trade in disseminating AIV over large geographic areas is still unclear, especially for developing countries with complex poultry production systems. Here we combine virus genomes and reconstructed poultry transportation data to measure and compare the spatial spread in China of three key subtypes of AIV: H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6. Although it is difficult to disentangle the contribution of confounding factors, such as bird migration and spatial distance, we find evidence that the dissemination of these subtypes among domestic poultry is geographically continuous and likely associated with the intensity of the live poultry trade in China. Using two independent data sources and network analysis methods, we report a regional-scale community structure in China that might explain the spread of AIV subtypes in the country. The identification of this structure has the potential to inform more targeted strategies for the prevention and control of AIV in China.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 the Author(s).

Population implications of the deployment of novel universal vaccines against epidemic and pandemic influenza.Arinaminpathy N1, Riley S1, Barclay WS2, Saad-Roy C3, Grenfell B4.\nAuthor informationAbstract   There is increasing interest in the development of new, 'universal' influenza vaccines (UIVs) that--unlike current vaccines--are effective against a broad range of seasonal influenza strains, as well as against novel pandemic viruses. While the existing literature discusses the potential epidemiological benefits of UIVs, it is also important to anticipate their potential unintended population consequences. Using mathematical modelling, we illustrate two such types of adverse consequences. First, by reducing the amount of infection-induced immunity in a population without fully replacing it, a seasonal UIV programme may permit larger pandemics than in the absence of vaccination. Second, the more successful a future UIV programme is in reducing transmission of seasonal influenza, the more vulnerable the population could become to the emergence of a vaccine escape variant. These risks could be mitigated by optimal deployment of any future UIV vaccine: namely, the use of a combined vaccine formulation (incorporating conventional as well as multiple universal antigenic targets) and achieving sufficient population coverage to compensate for any reductions in infection-induced immunity. In the absence of large-scale trials of UIVs, disease-dynamic models can provide helpful, early insights into their potential impact. In future, data from continuing vaccine development will be invaluable in developing robustly predictive modelling approaches.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  epidemiology; influenza; mathematical modelling; vaccine\n\n PMID: \t32126190 \tDOI: \t10.1098/rsif.2019.0879",

Genetic polymorphism ARG753GLN of TLR-2, LEU412PHE of TLR-3, ASP299GLY of TLR-4 in patients with influenza and influenza-associated pneumonia.Pryimenko NO1, Kotelevska TM1, Koval TI1, Syzova LM1, Dubynska HM1, Kaidashev I\u04201.\nAuthor informationAbstract OBJECTIVE:  The aim of the research is to study the prevalence and to determine the prognostic significance of polymorphism ARG753GLN of the TLR-2 gene, Leu412Phe of TLR-3, Asp299Gly of TLR-4 in influenza.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:  Materials and methods: 112 patients with influenza were examined (63 patients with uncomplicated course and 49 with influenza-associated pneumonia). The genotyping of the polymorphic site of ARG753GLN of the TLR-2 gene, Asp299Gly of the TLR-4 gene, and Leu412Phe of the TLR-3 gene was carried out by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers.\nRESULTS:  Results: It has found that the prevalence of the mutant allele 299Gly of TLR-4 in patients with uncomplicated influenza is 6.4 %, with influenza- associated pneumonia - 7.1 %, which exceeds the population control indicators by 3.8-4.3 times (1.7 %, p<0.05). Mutant allele 412Phe of TLR-3 is significantly more common in patients with influenzaassociated pneumonia (42.9%), as compared with uncomplicated influenza (24.6%, p<0.01) and healthy people (30.0%, p<0.05). The increased risk of influenza development is associated with the Asp/Gly genotype of TLR-4 (OR=4.22) and combination of mutant genotypes Leu/Phe and Phe/Phe of TLR-3 with Asp/Gly of TLR-4 and Arg/Gln of TLR-2 (OR=15.0); influenza-associated pneumonia - with genotype Phe/Phe of TLR-3 (OR=4.5).\nCONCLUSION:  Conclusions: It has been found out that among patients with influenza and influenza-associated pneumonia, the mutant allele 299Gly of TLR-4 and combinations of polymorphisms Arg753Gln of TLR-2, Leu412Phe of TLR-3, Asp299Gly of TLR-4 are detected reliably more often. The frequency of the mutant allele 412Phe of TLR-3 is higher among patients with influenza-associated pneumonia. Markers of increased risk of influenza are 299Gly allele and genotype Asp/Gly of TLR-4 and the combination of mutant genotypes Leu/Phe and Phe/Phe of TLR-3 with Asp/Gly of TLR-4 and Arg/Gln of TLR-2; for influenza-associated pneumonia - allele 412Phe and genotype Phe/Phe of TLR-3.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Arg753Gln polymorphism of the TLR-2 gene; Asp299Gly polymorphism of the TLR-4 gene; Leu412Phe polymorphism of the TLR-3 gene; genotype; influenza; influenza-associated pneumonia; allele\n\n PMID: \t32124747 \n   [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Heterosubtypic Protection Induced by a Live Attenuated Influenza Virus Vaccine Expressing Galactose-\u03b1-1,3-Galactose Epitopes in Infected Cells.Yan LM1, Lau SPN1, Poh CM1, Chan VSF2, Chan MCW1, Peiris M1, Poon LLM3.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Anti-galactose-\u03b1-1,3-galactose (anti-\u03b1-Gal) antibody is naturally expressed at a high level in humans. It constitutes about 1% of immunoglobulins found in human blood. Here, we designed a live attenuated influenza virus vaccine that can generate \u03b1-Gal epitopes in infected cells in order to facilitate opsonization of infected cells, thereby enhancing vaccine-induced immune responses. In the presence of normal human sera, cells infected with this mutant can enhance phagocytosis of human macrophages and cytotoxicity of NK cells in vitro Using a knockout mouse strain that allows expression of anti-\u03b1-Gal antibody in vivo, we showed that this strategy can increase vaccine immunogenicity and the breadth of protection. This vaccine can induce 100% protection against a lethal heterosubtypic group 1 (H5) or group 2 (mouse-adapted H3) influenza virus challenge in the mouse model. In contrast, its heterosubtypic protective effect in wild-type or knockout mice that do not have anti-\u03b1-Gal antibody expression is only partial, demonstrating that the enhanced vaccine-induced protection requires anti-\u03b1-Gal antibody upon vaccination. Anti-\u03b1-Gal-expressing knockout mice immunized with this vaccine produce robust humoral and cell-mediated responses upon a lethal virus challenge. This vaccine can stimulate CD11blo/- pulmonary dendritic cells, which are known to be crucial for clearance of influenza virus. Our approach provides a novel strategy for developing next-generation influenza virus vaccines.IMPORTANCE Influenza A viruses have multiple HA subtypes that are antigenically diverse. Classical influenza virus vaccines are subtype specific, and they cannot induce satisfactory heterosubtypic immunity against multiple influenza virus subtypes. Here, we developed a live attenuated H1N1 influenza virus vaccine that allows the expression of \u03b1-Gal epitopes by infected cells. Anti-\u03b1-Gal antibody is naturally produced by humans. In the presence of this antibody, human cells infected with this experimental vaccine virus can enhance several antibody-mediated immune responses in vitro Importantly, mice expressing anti-\u03b1-Gal antibody in vivo can be fully protected by this H1N1 vaccine against a lethal H5 or H3 virus challenge. Our work demonstrates a new strategy for using a single influenza virus strain to induce broadly cross-reactive immune responses against different influenza virus subtypes.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Yan et al.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  immunology; influenza; influenza virus vaccines; live vector vaccines; universal vaccine\n\n PMID: \t32127444 \tDOI: \t10.1128/mBio.00027-20 \n  Free full text",

Obesity-Related Microenvironment Promotes Emergence of Virulent Influenza Virus Strains.Honce R1,2, Karlsson EA1, Wohlgemuth N1, Estrada LD1, Meliopoulos VA1, Yao J1, Schultz-Cherry S3.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Obesity is associated with increased disease severity, elevated viral titers in exhaled breath, and significantly prolonged viral shed during influenza A virus infection. Due to the mutable nature of RNA viruses, we questioned whether obesity could also influence influenza virus population diversity. Here, we show that minor variants rapidly emerge in obese mice. The variants exhibit increased viral replication, resulting in enhanced virulence in wild-type mice. The increased diversity of the viral population correlated with decreased type I interferon responses, and treatment of obese mice with recombinant interferon reduced viral diversity, suggesting that the delayed antiviral response exhibited in obesity permits the emergence of a more virulent influenza virus population. This is not unique to obese mice. Obesity-derived normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells also showed decreased interferon responses and increased viral replication, suggesting that viral diversity also was impacted in this increasing population.IMPORTANCE Currently, 50% of the adult population worldwide is overweight or obese. In these studies, we demonstrate that obesity not only enhances the severity of influenza infection but also impacts viral diversity. The altered microenvironment associated with obesity supports a more diverse viral quasispecies and affords the emergence of potentially pathogenic variants capable of inducing greater disease severity in lean hosts. This is likely due to the impaired interferon response, which is seen in both obese mice and obesity-derived human bronchial epithelial cells, suggesting that obesity, aside from its impact on influenza virus pathogenesis, permits the stochastic accumulation of potentially pathogenic viral variants, raising concerns about its public health impact as the prevalence of obesity continues to rise.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Honce et al.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  NHBE; influenza; interferons; obesity; viral evolution; virulence\n\n PMID: \t32127459 \tDOI: \t10.1128/mBio.03341-19 \n  Free full text",

A DNA Vaccine That Encodes an Antigen-Presenting Cell-Specific Heterodimeric Protein Protects against Cancer and Influenza.Braathen R1, Sp\u00e5ng HCL1, Hinke DM1, Blazevski J1, Bobic S1, Fossum E1, Bogen B1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Immunogenicity of DNA vaccines can be increased by constructing the DNA in such a way that it encodes secreted homodimeric fusion proteins that target antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In this study, we have developed novel APC-targeting vaccine molecules with an increased flexibility due to introduction of a heterodimerization motif. The heterodimeric proteins permit four different fusions within a single molecule, thus allowing expression of two different APC-targeting moieties and two different antigens. Two types of heterodimeric fusion proteins were developed that employed either the ACID/BASE or the Barnase/Barstar motifs, respectively. The ACID/BASE heterodimeric vaccines conferred protection against challenges with either influenza virus or tumor cells in separate preclinical models. The ACID/BASE motif was flexible since a large number of different targeting moieties and antigens could be introduced with maintenance of specificity, antigenicity, and secretion. APC-targeting ACID/BASE vaccines expressing two different antigens induced antibody and T cell responses against either of the two antigens. Heterodimeric ACID/BASE DNA vaccines were of approximately the same potency as previously reported homodimeric DNA vaccines. The flexibility and potency of the ACID/BASE format suggest that it could be a useful platform for DNA vaccines that encode APC-targeting fusion proteins.\n  \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  APC targeting; DNA vaccine; heterodimer; influenza; myeloma\n\n PMID: \t32128342 \tPMCID: \tPMC7044496 \tDOI: \t10.1016/j.omtm.2020.01.007 \nFree PMC Article",

Influenza vaccines: the potential benefits of cell-culture isolation and manufacturing.Rajaram S1, Boikos C1, Gelone DK2, Gandhi A3.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Influenza continues to cause severe illness in millions and deaths in hundreds of thousands annually. Vaccines are used to prevent influenza outbreaks, however, the influenza virus mutates and annual vaccination is required for optimal protection. Vaccine effectiveness is also affected by other potential factors such as the human immune system, a mismatch with the chosen candidate virus, and egg adaptation associated with egg-based vaccine production. This article reviews the influenza vaccine development process and describes the implications of the changes to the cell-culture process and vaccine strain recommendations by the World Health Organization since the 2017 season. The traditional manufacturing process for influenza vaccines relies on fertilized chicken eggs that are used for vaccine production. Vaccines must be produced in large volumes and the complete process requires approximately 6\u2009months for the egg-based process. In addition, egg adaptation of seed viruses occurs when viruses adapt to avian receptors found within eggs to allow for growth in eggs. These changes to key viral antigens may result in antigenic mismatch and thereby reduce vaccine effectiveness. By contrast, cell-derived seed viruses do not require fertilized eggs and eliminate the potential for egg-adapted changes. As a result, cell-culture technology improves the match between the vaccine virus strain and the vaccine selected strain, and has been associated with increased vaccine effectiveness during a predominantly H3N2 season. During the 2017-2018 influenza season, a small number of studies conducted in the United States compared the effectiveness of egg-based and cell-culture vaccines and are described here. These observational and retrospective studies demonstrate that inactivated cell-culture vaccines were more effective than egg-based vaccines. Adoption of cell-culture technology for influenza vaccine manufacturing has been reported to improve manufacturing efficiency and the additional benefit of improving vaccine effectiveness is a key factor for future policy making considerations.\n  \u00a9 The Author(s), 2020.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Influenza; cell-culture technology; vaccine\n\n PMID: \t32128506 \tPMCID: \tPMC7036483 \tDOI: \t10.1177/2515135520908121 \nFree PMC Article",

Effectiveness and Parental Acceptability of Social Networking Interventions for Promoting Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Among Young Children: Randomized Controlled Trial.Liao Q1, Fielding R1, Cheung YTD1, Lian J2, Yuan J1, Lam WWT1.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  Seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) coverage among young children remains low worldwide. Mobile social networking apps such as WhatsApp Messenger are promising tools for health interventions.\nOBJECTIVE:  This was a preliminary study to test the effectiveness and parental acceptability of a social networking intervention that sends weekly vaccination reminders and encourages exchange of SIV-related views and experiences among mothers via WhatsApp discussion groups for promoting childhood SIV. The second objective was to examine the effect of introducing time pressure on mothers' decision making for childhood SIV for vaccination decision making. This was done using countdowns of the recommended vaccination timing.\nMETHODS:  Mothers of child(ren) aged 6 to 72 months were randomly allocated to control or to one of two social networking intervention groups receiving vaccination reminders with (SNI+TP) or without (SNI-TP) a time pressure component via WhatsApp discussion groups at a ratio of 5:2:2. All participants first completed a baseline assessment. Both the SNI-TP and SNI+TP groups subsequently received weekly vaccination reminders from October to December 2017 and participated in WhatsApp discussions about SIV moderated by a health professional. All participants completed a follow-up assessment from April to May 2018.\nRESULTS:  A total of 84.9% (174/205), 71% (57/80), and 75% (60/80) who were allocated to the control, SNI-TP, and SNI+TP groups, respectively, completed the outcome assessment. The social networking intervention significantly promoted mothers' self-efficacy for taking children for SIV (SNI-TP: odds ratio [OR] 2.69 [1.07-6.79]; SNI+TP: OR 2.50 [1.13-5.55]), but did not result in significantly improved children's SIV uptake. Moreover, after adjusting for mothers' working status, introducing additional time pressure reduced the overall SIV uptake in children of working mothers (OR 0.27 [0.10-0.77]) but significantly increased the SIV uptake among children of mothers without a full-time job (OR 6.53 [1.87-22.82]). Most participants' WhatsApp posts were about sharing experience or views (226/434, 52.1%) of which 44.7% (101/226) were categorized as negative, such as their concerns over vaccine safety, side effects and effectiveness. Although participants shared predominantly negative experience or views about SIV at the beginning of the discussion, the moderator was able to encourage the discussion of more positive experience or views and more knowledge and information. Most intervention group participants indicated willingness to receive the same interventions (110/117, 94.0%) and recommend the interventions to other mothers (102/117, 87.2%) in future.\nCONCLUSIONS:  Online information support can effectively promote mothers' self-efficacy for taking children for SIV but alone it may not sufficient to address maternal concerns over SIV to achieve a positive vaccination decision. However, the active involvement of health professionals in online discussions can shape positive discussions about vaccination. Time pressure on decision making interacts with maternal work status, facilitating vaccination uptake among mothers who may have more free time, but having the opposite effect among busier working mothers.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:  Hong Kong University Clinical Trials Registry HKUCTR-2250; https://tinyurl.com/vejv276.\n  \u00a9Qiuyan Liao, Richard Fielding, Yee Tak Derek Cheung, Jinxiao Lian, Jiehu Yuan, Wendy Wing Tak Lam.

Epidemic of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 analyzed by full genome sequences and the first case of oseltamivir-resistant strain in Myanmar 2017.Kyaw Win SM1, Saito R1,2, Win NC1, Lasham DJ1, Kyaw Y3, Lin N4, Thein KN5, Chon I2, Odagiri T6, Thein W7, Kyaw LL7, Tin OS7, Saitoh A8, Tamura T9, Hirokawa C9, Uchida Y10, Saito T10, Watanabe S11, Odagiri T11, Kamata K1,12, Osada H1,12, Dapat C13, Watanabe H1,12, Tin HH7.\nAuthor informationAbstract   A community outbreak of human influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strains was observed in Myanmar in 2017. We investigated the circulation patterns, antigenicity, and drug resistance of 2017 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from Myanmar and characterized the full genome of influenza virus strains in Myanmar from in-patients and out-patients to assess the pathogenicity of the viruses. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from out-patients and in-patients with acute respiratory tract infections in Yangon and Pyinmana City in Myanmar during January-December 2017. A total of 215 out-patients and 18 in-patients infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 were detected by virus isolation and real-time RT-PCR. Among the positive patients, 90.6% were less than 14 years old. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers against A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in Myanmar were similar to the recommended Japanese influenza vaccine strain for 2017-2018 seasons (A/Singapore/GP1908/2015) and WHO recommended 2017 southern hemisphere vaccine component (A/Michigan/45/2015). Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin sequence showed that the Myanmar strains belonged to the genetic subclade 6B.1, possessing mutations of S162N and S164T at potential antigenic sites. However, the amino acid mutation at position 222, which may enhance the severity of disease and mortality, was not found. One case with no prior history of oseltamivir treatment possessed H275Y mutated virus in neuraminidase (NA), which confers resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir with elevated IC50 values. The full genome sequence of Myanmar strains showed no difference between samples from in-patients and out-patients, suggesting no additional viral mutations associated with patient severity. Several amino acid changes were observed in PB2, PB1, and M2 of Myanmar strains when compared to the vaccine strain and other Asian strains. However, no mutations associated with pathogenicity were found in the Myanmar strains, suggesting that viral factors cannot explain the underlying reasons of the massive outbreak in Myanmar. This study reported the first detection of an oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus in Myanmar, highlighting the importance of continuous antiviral monitoring and genetic characterization of the influenza virus in Myanmar.\n\n\n PMID: \t32130243 \tDOI: \t10.1371/journal.pone.0229601 \n  Free full text",

The genetic basis, biological functions, and epitopes of the obtained BnAbs were assessed and modeled.\nResults:  Two BnAbs, 2-12D5, and 3-37G7.1, were respectively obtained from two human H5N1 cases on days 12 and 21 after disease onset. Both Abs demonstrated cross-neutralizing and Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity.

Signature motifs for binding with the HA stem, namely, IFY in V H1-69-encoded Abs and LXYFXW in D3-9-encoded Abs, were also observed in 2-12D5 and 3-32G7.1, respectively.\nConclusions:  Cross-reactive B cells of different germline origins could be activated and re-circulated by avian influenza virus. The HA stem epitopes targeted by the BnAbs, and the two Ab-encoding genes usage implied the VH1-69 and D3-9 are the ideal candidates triggered by influenza virus for vaccine development.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.

[Epub ahead of print]  Pandemic potential of highly pathogenic avian influenza clade 2.3.4.4 A(H5) viruses.Yamaji R1, Saad MD1, Davis CT2, Swayne DE3, Wang D4, Wong FYK5, McCauley JW6, Peiris JSM7, Webby RJ8, Fouchier RAM9, Kawaoka Y10,11,12, Zhang W1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   The panzootic caused by A/goose/Guangdong/1/96-lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) viruses has occurred in multiple waves since 1996. From 2013 onwards, clade 2.3.4.4 viruses of subtypes A(H5N2), A(H5N6), and A(H5N8) emerged to cause panzootic waves of unprecedented magnitude among avian species accompanied by severe losses to the poultry industry around the world. Clade 2.3.4.4 A(H5) viruses have expanded in distinct geographical and evolutionary pathways likely via long distance migratory bird dispersal onto several continents and by poultry trade among neighboring countries. Coupled with regional circulation, the viruses have evolved further by reassorting with local viruses. As of February 2019, there have been 23 cases of humans infected with clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 viruses, 16 (70%) of which had fatal outcomes. To date, no HPAI A(H5) virus has caused sustainable human-to-human transmission. However, due to the lack of population immunity in humans and ongoing evolution of the virus, there is a continuing risk that clade 2.3.4.4 A(H5) viruses could cause an influenza pandemic if the ability to transmit efficiently among humans was gained. Therefore, multisectoral collaborations among the animal, environmental, and public health sectors are essential to conduct risk assessments and develop countermeasures to prevent disease and to control spread. In this article, we describe an assessment of the likelihood of clade 2.3.4.4 A(H5) viruses gaining human-to-human transmissibility and impact on human health should such human-to-human transmission occur. This structured analysis assessed properties of the virus, attributes of the human population, and ecology and epidemiology of these viruses in animal hosts.\n  \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

All attendees and members of the public are urged to follow the well-established prevention tips like staying home if sick and calling ahead to a health provider if experiencing symptoms. We will work with AIPAC leadership to keep all attendees informed of any new developments.\u201d\n\nFurther background from DC Health:\nDC Health has been in communication with NY about the two positive cases. They were asymptomatic, meaning they were not experiencing symptoms like fever or cough, while they were in DC. The information provided to us by NY indicates that both cases have no identifiable risk for anyone exposed to them.\n\n*CDC Guidance*\nHow COVID-19 SpreadsThe virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).\nThrough respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\nThese droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.\n\nCan someone spread the virus without being sick?\nPeople are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest). Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...nsmission.html\n\nhttps://coronavirus.dc.gov/release/d...c-tweet-362020",

Published online March 4, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.3227\n\nCOVID-19 Resource Center\n\nCoronaviruses have been implicated in nosocomial outbreaks1 with environmental contamination as a route of transmission.2 Similarly, nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been reported.3 However, the mode of transmission and extent of environmental contamination are unknown.\n\nMethods\n\nFrom January 24 to February 4, 2020, 3 patients at the dedicated SARS-CoV-2 outbreak center in Singapore in airborne infection isolation rooms (12 air exchanges per hour) with anterooms and bathrooms had surface environmental samples taken at 26 sites. Personal protective equipment (PPE) samples from study physicians exiting the patient rooms also were collected. Sterile premoistened swabs were used.\n\nAir sampling was done on 2 days using SKC Universal pumps (with 37-mm filter cassettes and 0.3-\u03bcm polytetrafluoroethylene filters for 4 hours at 5 L/min) in the room and anteroom and a Sartorius MD8 microbiological sampler (with gelatin membrane filter for 15 minutes at 6 m3/h) outside the room (eFigure in the Supplement).\n\nSpecific real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and E genes4 was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (see detailed methods in the eAppendix in the Supplement). Cycle threshold values, ie, number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross the threshold in RT-PCR, quantified viral load, with lower values indicating higher viral load.\n\nSamples were collected on 5 days over a 2-week period. One patient\u2019s room was sampled before routine cleaning and 2 patients\u2019 rooms after routine cleaning. Twice-daily cleaning of high-touch areas was done using 5000 ppm of sodium dichloroisocyanurate. The floor was cleaned daily using 1000 ppm of sodium dichloroisocyanurate.\n\nClinical data (symptoms, day of illness, and RT-PCR results) and timing of cleaning were collected and correlated with sampling results. Percentage positivity was calculated for rooms with positive environmental swabs. Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained as part of a larger multicenter study.\n\nResults\n\nPatient A\u2019s room was sampled on days 4 and 10 of illness while the patient was still symptomatic, after routine cleaning. All samples were negative. Patient B was symptomatic on day 8 and asymptomatic on day 11 of illness; samples taken on these 2 days after routine cleaning were negative (Table 1).\n\nPatient C, whose samples were collected before routine cleaning, had positive results, with 13 (87%) of 15 room sites (including air outlet fans) and 3 (60%) of 5 toilet sites (toilet bowl, sink, and door handle) returning positive results (Table 2). Anteroom and corridor samples were negative. Patient C had upper respiratory tract involvement with no pneumonia and had 2 positive stool samples for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR despite not having diarrhea.\n\nPatient C had greater viral shedding, with a cycle threshold value of 25.69 in nasopharyngeal samples compared with 31.31 and 35.33 in patients A and B (Table 1).\n\nOnly 1 PPE swab, from the surface of a shoe front, was positive. All other PPE swabs were negative. All air samples were negative.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThere was extensive environmental contamination by 1 SARS-CoV-2 patient with mild upper respiratory tract involvement. Toilet bowl and sink samples were positive, suggesting that viral shedding in stool5 could be a potential route of transmission. Postcleaning samples were negative, suggesting that current decontamination measures are sufficient.\n\nAir samples were negative despite the extent of environmental contamination. Swabs taken from the air exhaust outlets tested positive, suggesting that small virus-laden droplets may be displaced by airflows and deposited on equipment such as vents. The positive PPE sample was unsurprising because shoe covers are not part of PPE recommendations. The risk of transmission from contaminated footwear is likely low, as evidenced by negative results in the anteroom and clean corridor.\n\nThis study has several limitations. First, viral culture was not done to demonstrate viability. Second, due to operational limitations during an outbreak, methodology was inconsistent and sample size was small. Third, the volume of air sampled represents only a small fraction of total volume, and air exchanges in the room would have diluted the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the air. Further studies are required to confirm these preliminary results.\n\nSignificant environmental contamination by patients with SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory droplets and fecal shedding suggests the environment as a potential medium of transmission and supports the need for strict adherence to environmental and hand hygiene.\n...\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jam...rticle/2762692",

It reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice.Abstract\nInfo/History\nMetrics\n Preview PDF\nAbstractBACKGROUND We described the epidemiological features of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak, and evaluated the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic in Wuhan, China. METHODS Individual-level data on 25,961 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases reported through February 18, 2020 were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System. Based on key events and interventions, we divided the epidemic into four periods: before January 11, January 11-22, January 23 - February 1, and February 2-18. We compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and different demographic groups. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. RESULTS The median age of the cases was 57 years and 50.3% were women. The attack rate peaked in the third period and substantially declined afterwards across geographic regions, sex and age groups, except for children (age <20) whose attack rate continued to increase. Healthcare workers and elderly people had higher attack rates and severity risk increased with age. The effective reproductive number dropped from 3.86 (95% credible interval 3.74 to 3.97) before interventions to 0.32 (0.28 to 0.37) post interventions. The interventions were estimated to prevent 94.5% (93.7 to 95.2%) infections till February 18. We found that at least 59% of infected cases were unascertained in Wuhan, potentially including asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS Considerable countermeasures have effectively controlled the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan. Special efforts are needed to protect vulnerable populations, including healthcare workers, elderly and children. Estimation of unascertained cases has important implications on continuing surveillance and interventions.\n...\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1....03.20030593v1",

The report distills research priorities into nine key areas.\n  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said may efforts are well under way, adding that the WHO has received prequalification applications for 40 diagnostic tests and about 20 vaccines are under development.\nWHO notes stretched oxygen supplies  He also said the WHO is monitoring supplies of 20 essential devices and noted that some areas are experiencing shortages of medical oxygen. Efforts are onging with partners to increase access, he said.\n  The WHO estimates that about 15% of COVID-19 illnesses are critical and require oxygen.\n  Several more countries reported their first cases, including Cameroon, Serbia, Bhutan, Peru, Slovakia, and Colombia. Cameroon's case was linked to a traveler from France, and Serbia's case occurred in a traveler from Hungary.\n  Bhutan said its confirmed case-patient had traveled to India. Peru's patient had been in three European countries. Slovakia's first patient had not traveled, but his son had recently visited Venice, and Colombia's patient had visited Italy.\n  In its situation report today, the WHO said that, over the last 24 hours, 17,481 cases, including 335 deaths, have been reported outside China from 88 countries.\nCases surge in Italy, elsewhere in Europe  Italy's health ministry today reported 778 new cases, along with 49 new deaths\u2014more than any previous day. The developments push the country's overall totals to 4,639 cases and 197 deaths. Though cases and some clusters have been reported in all of Italy's regions, three northern ones\u2014Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and Veneto\u2014have had by far the most cases.\n  Vatican City has reported its first case, which came just days after Pope Francis tested negative, according to a media report that quoted a Vatican spokesman. Masses have been suspended from Mar 9 through Mar 13 in the three hard-hit regions, plus a few provinces in two other regions.\n  A joint team from the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) today wrapped up a 12-day mission to Italy and issued an assessment, which recommends that the country continue containment measures, focusing on suspect case identification and testing across the whole country.\n  The team also recommended a combination of other strategies to areas where the disease is widespread. The combination prioritizes patient isolation, treatment, and hospital preparedness.\n  The WHO and ECDC experts also said Italy can be a \"knowledge-generating platform\" to help the science community better understand the virus and its behavior.\n  Though Italy is the epicenter of activity in Europe, several other nations are reporting accelerating cases, including the United Kingdom, which reported 47 new cases today, raising its total to 163\u2014double what it was 2 days ago. Switzerland today reported 94 new cases, boosting its number to 181, and France reported 190 more, increasing its total to 613.\nSouth Korea reports steady rise but lower death rate  South Korea today reported 518 new cases, along with 8 more deaths, raising the total to 6,284 cases, 42 of them fatal. The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention said about 70% of its cases are linked to clusters.\n  A report earlier in the week from the South China Morning Post noted that South Korea's mortality rate is estimated to be 0.6%, much lower than earlier estimates for China and much lower than the 3.4% the WHO has noted, based on raw global data. Experts said the lower estimate may reflect wider and aggressive testing by South Korea, which may produce a truer picture of the mortality rate.\n  Who officials said today at a media briefing that estimating case-fatality rate during an epidemic is a moving target and serology studies are desperately needed to assess how many people are infected, a number that would help experts more accurately calculate morality from the virus.\n  In other Asian developments:China reported 143 new cases, 30 more deaths, and 215 fewer serious cases, bringing its totals to 80,552, 3,042, and 5,737, according to the National Health Commission. Of the new cases, 126 were in Hubei province.\nJapan reported 53 new cases today, up from 26 new infections yesterday and raising its total to 366, according to the country's health ministry. Japan lists its overall total at 407 cases, which includes 41 asymptomatic carriers. The new cases were from 14 different prefectures.\nSingapore today reported 13 new cases, raising its total to 130, according to the health ministry. Of the new cases, 9 were linked to a private dinner function, 1 to a previous case, 2 likely imported, and 1 with no known link.\nIran cases approach 5,000  Elsewhere, Iran's health ministry reported 1,234 new cases and 16 more deaths, boosting its overall totals to 4,747 cases, which includes 124 deaths.\n  Iran, which has already cancelled schools, is starting to limit travel to some affected areas, the BBC reported.\n  Iran has the world's third-highest COVID-19 case total, behind China and South Korea. Italy is the only other country with more than 4,000 infections. No other country beside those four has topped 700 confirmed cases.",

All other states report 5 or fewer cases. As of this afternoon, officials have confirmed 260 US cases, more than the United Kingdom (163), Singapore (130), and Hong Kong (106).\nU Washington suspends in-person classes   Washington state also has the most deaths, 14, according to a daily tally maintained by the Seattle Times. Most of the fatal cases involved residents of a Seattle-area nursing home, the Life Care Center. \n  The US death total rose to 16 after another passenger who was aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship traveling from Hawaii to California died from complications of COVID-19, the Los Angeles Times reported. The Grand Princess is being held off the coast of San Francisco as dozens of passengers are being tested for the novel coronavirus.\n  Today the University of Washington in Seattle, with 50,000 students, said it was suspending in-person classes and conducting all classes online until winter quarter ends on Mar 20. This is the first major US university to take that step. The Seattle Times says the decision affects more than 48,000 students on the Seattle campus, nearly 6,000 in Bothell and about 5,300 in Tacoma. Seattle University announced similar today, as well.\nOver 4,000 New Yorkers in quarantine  In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo tweeted that the 11 new cases in that state are all related to a case identified in Westchester County, in the New York City suburb of New Rochelle.\n  Cuomo said 44 New Yorkers are under mandatory quarantine, which means they have a confirmed case of COVID-19, had direct contact with a case, or have symptoms and recently returned from a country with active spread.\n  Cuomo said an additional 4,000 New Yorkers are under a precautionary quarantine, which applies to those who have returned from a country with COVID-19 but are asymptomatic, had proximate (not direct) contact with a case, or were recommended to self-quarantine by a health official. \nSeveral states report first cases  Overnight, several US states reported their first cases or added to their case count. Texas now had five cases, and eight more possible cases are under investigation. All confirmed and possible case-patients recently traveled to Egypt as part of a tour group. \n  In Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Wolf announced the state's first two presumptive positive cases. Both case-patients recently traveled to a country with COVID-19 spread.\n  The Maryland Department of Health tweeted that officials confirmed the state's first three COVID-19 cases, all in people who had recently traveled. All patients are being treated in home isolation and are in good condition. \n  The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) confirmed late this afternoon its first patient, in an older resident of Ramsey County (which is home so St. Paul) who had been on a cruise with a known COVID-19 case-patient. The Minnesota patient is in home isolation and doing well, the MDH said.\n  In Nevada, health officials in Clark County confirmed the state's first case, in a man who had recently traveled to both Washington and Texas. \nColorado also announced its first patient, a man in his 30s who had contact with a known COVID-19 case. As in Pennsylvania, the case is presumed positive until it can be confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nCalifornia, Medicare to pay for testing \n  Finally today, California Governor Gavin Newsom said all commercial and state-funded insurance plans will offer free COVID-19 testing. \n  \"Californians shouldn't have to fear a big medical bill just because they took a test for COVID-19,\" Newsom said in a press statement. \"This action means that Californians who fit the testing requirements can receive the test at no cost. We're all in this together, and I'm grateful to those health providers who have already stepped up and heeded our call.\" \n  The federal government also announced that COVID-19 testing will be covered under Medicare Part B.",

But the CDC said the flu season continues to be tough on children, as 11 new pediatric flu-related deaths were confirmed.\n  \"Pneumonia and influenza mortality has been low, but 136 influenza-associated deaths in children have been reported so far this season,\" the CDC said. \"This number is higher for the same time period than in every season since reporting began in 2004-05, except for the 2009 pandemic.\" The pediatric death toll was 144 in the 2018-2019 flu season.\n  All regions are still reporting elevated flu activity, but rates of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) dropped last week, from 5.5% to 5.3%. The percentage of specimens positively identified as influenza also dropped, from 28% to 24.3%.\n  The number of jurisdictions reporting high ILI activity included New York City, Puerto Rico, and 40 states, down from 43 states last week. The number of jurisdictions reporting regional or widespread flu increased, however, from 48 to 51.\n  The cumulative hospitalization rate rose from 52.7 to 57.9 per 100,000 population last week. Children ages 0 to 4 years were hospitalized at a rate of 84.9 per 100,000 population, and those 65 or older were hospitalized at a rate of 147.5 per 100,000 population.\nMar 6 CDC FluView report\n\nDRC starts countdown to Ebola outbreak end  In its weekly snapshot on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Ebola outbreak yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the country hasn't reported a new case since Feb 17. The agency added that, on Mar 3, the last patient confirmed with the disease was discharged from an Ebola treatment center.\n  The WHO said that although the events marked an important milestone, there's still a high risk of recurrence and it's critical to maintain response operations. A country must pass 42 days, which equals two incubation periods, after the last infected person tests negative a second time.\n  As of Mar 3, the country's overall outbreak total stood at 3,444, which includes 134 probable cases and 2,264 deaths. The WHO praised the international community for covering about half of the $83 million price tag for battling the virus from January through June of this year, but it still needs $40 million in support to continue response activities.\n  Ebola virus can persist in some body fluids in protected parts of the body, such the eyes or testes, and cases linked to survivors in past outbreaks have triggered new transmission chains. Early in the outbreak, the DRC and its partners established a national program for Ebola survivors. The WHO said 1,160 people have survived the disease, about three fourths of them adults.\n  In published remarks, Ibrahima Soce Fall, MD, the WHO's assistant director for emergency response, today said the last patient to leave treatment was a woman in Beni. \"This is why it's critical to maintain surveillance and rapid response capacities. And that's what we are doing. We're still in full response mode.\"\nMar 5 WHO update\nMar 6 WHO comments on last case\nWHO online Ebola dashboard\nStudy finds wide variability in antibiotic use at US children's hospitals  A cross-sectional examination of antibiotic use in US children's hospitals has found that, on any given day, more than a third of hospitalized children are receiving an antibiotic, and 1 in 8 are receiving a broad-spectrum antibiotic, US researchers reported today in Infection Control an Hospital Epidemiology.\n  The study, conducted by researchers from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, looked at antibiotic prescribing at 51 US children's hospitals that participate in the Children's Hospital Association's Pediatric Health Information System. Single-day assessments of antibiotic use among al patients at the hospitals were conducted on May 3, 2017; Aug 2, 2017; Oct 25, 2017; and Jan 31, 2018. The main outcome of interest was receipt of an oral, intravenous, or inhalation antibiotic on the study day.\n  Of 52,769 total hospitalized children, 19,174 (36.3%) received antibiotics on the study day and 6,575 (12.5%) received broad-spectrum antibiotics. The overall prevalence of antibiotic use varied across hospitals, ranging from 22.3% to 51.9%, and did not appear to be explained by the clinical complexity of patients. Antibiotic use prevalence was 29.2% among medical patients and 47.7% among surgical patients.\n  Although there was no significant seasonal variation in antibiotic use, regional prevalence varied, ranging from 32.7% in the Midwest to 40.2% in the West (P < .001). Among hospital units, pediatric intensive care unit patients had the highest prevalence of both overall and broad-spectrum antibiotic use, at 58.3% and 26.6%, respectively (P < .001).\n  The authors of the study say further exploration of the main drivers of inpatient antibiotic use variability could help inform antibiotic stewardship efforts.\nMar 6 Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol abstract\nNew polio cases reported in Pakistan, Afghanistan, African countries  The latest weekly update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) today shows six counties reporting new cases, with Afghanistan and Pakistan reporting new wild polio virus type 1 (WPV1) infections and four African nations reporting vaccine-derived cases.\n  The two WPV1 cases in Afghanistan, one each in Helmand and Zabul provinces, are the country's first cases of 2020. In 2019, Afghanistan reported 29. The four WPV1 infections in Pakistan\u2014one each in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, and Balochistan provinces\u2014bring the country's 2020 total to 21, compared with 146 WPV1 cases in all of 2019.\n  The circulating vaccine-derived polio virus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases reported in Africa include 1 in Angola in Benguela province; 4 in Chad's Ouaddai, Chari Baguirmi, Batha, and Logone Oriental provinces; 2 in the DRC's Lualaba and Tshopo provinces; and 1 case in Ethiopia's Oromyia province. In addition, Angola reported two cVDPV2-positive environmental samples, and Somalia and Ivory Coast each reported one cVDPV2-positive environmental sample. Malaysia reported thee cVDPV2-positive environmental samples.\n  GPEI says the risk of further cVDPV2 spread across the Lake Chad subregion remains high.\n  The update also noted that Iran has been removed from the list of outbreak countries after months of consultations and a high level of poliovirus surveillance sensitivity, triggered by the May 2019 isolation of WPV1 in a sewage sample from Sistan and Balochistan province.\nMar 6 GPEI weekly update\n\nWHO study shows uptick in global measles incidence  Global measles incidence increased from 2013 through 2018, and while reasons for the rise are multifactorial and vary by country, inadequate immunization is a key factor, researchers from the World Health Organization (WHO) reported yesterday in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.\n  The analysis of case-based measles surveillance data reported to the WHO, World Bank country income status, and estimates of national immunization coverage found that a total of 1,495,559 suspected measles cases were reported from 2013 through 2018, and 899,800 were eventually classified as measles. Global annual incidence for 2018 was 46 cases per million persons, the highest annual incidence in the study period. Of the 899,800 measles patients, 45% never received the measles vaccine, 12% received one dose, and 30% had an unknown vaccination history.\n  Lower- and middle-income countries accounted for 66% of cases, with 70% coming from  Nigeria, India, Philippines, Ukraine, and Pakistan. Seventy-seven percent of patients were under the age of 15, with the incidence highest in those under the age of 1. The median age of patients increased by country income status, and in high-income countries with historically stronger vaccination programs, patients had higher median ages.\n  The analysis also found that high-income countries have many cases in people 15 and older who were unvaccinated or undervaccinated. That's a shift from the prevaccine era, when 95% were immune by age 15, the authors of the study note, and a finding that could help guide measles elimination efforts in those countries.\n  \"To achieve elimination, immunization programs and primary care services must be strengthened, and strategies targeting those outside the age of most routine immunization services also need to be undertaken in some countries to close remaining immunity gaps,\" the authors wrote. They also urged countries to improve case-based surveillance.\nMar 5 J Infect Dis study",

The MOH listed the case as primary, meaning he is unlikely to have contracted the virus from another person. The patient is not a healthcare worker.\n  Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe illness and is associated with about a 34% death rate. The virus can transmit between humans but has done so mainly in healthcare settings, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n  As of Jan 31, 2020, the WHO said that it had received reports of 2,519 laboratory-con\ufb01rmed MERS infections, including 866 associated deaths. The vast majority of these cases occurred in Saudi Arabia.\nMar 5 Saudi MOH report\n\nTrial demonstrates effectiveness of highly-resistant TB regimen  The results of the clinical trial that helped pave the way for US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the new tuberculosis drug pretomanid appeared today in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n  The phase 3 Nix-TB trial, conducted at three sites in South Africa by a team of British, South African, and US researchers from April 2015 through November 2017, evaluated the safety and efficacy of 26 weeks of combined treatment with oral pretomanid, bedaquiline, and linezolid in patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) that was not responsive to treatment. The primary end point was incidence of an unfavorable outcome, defined as treatment failure or relapse during follow-up, at 6 months after the end of treatment.\n  Of the 109 patients enrolled in the trial, 11 (10%) had an unfavorable outcome and 98 patients (90%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 83% to 95%) had a favorable outcome at 6 months after the end of therapy. Among the 71 patients with XDR-TB, 63 (89%; 95% CI, 79% to 95%) had a favorable outcome, and 35 of 38 MDR-TB patients (92%; 95% CI, 79% to 98%) had a favorable outcome. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 88 patients (81%) and myelosuppression in 52 patients (48%). Both adverse effects were linked to linezolid.\n  The FDA approved pretomanid\u2014which was developed by the nonprofit TB Alliance, as part of the three-drug combination for patients with XDR- and MDR-TB\u2014in August 2019. The 6-month regimen is significantly shorter than current treatment regimens for highly drug-resistant TB, which last 18 to 24 months, involve as many as eight drugs, and have low cure rates.\n  \"For both individual patients with tuberculosis and national tuberculosis programs, a shorter duration of treatment that is effective is beneficial,\" the authors of the study wrote.\n  A secondary end point of treatment failure at 24 months after end of treatment is currently being measured. The authors note that there has been only one additional relapse among the 47 patients who have reached this point in the study.\nMar 5 N Engl J Med study\nAug 14, 2019, CIDRAP News story \"FDA approves new drug for highly resistant tuberculosis\"\n\nStudy: New urine culture order tied to less testing, antibiotic use  The addition of a new order set for urine cultures at five Texas hospitals was associated with decreases in the number of urine cultures performed and days of antibiotic therapy and substantial financial savings, researchers reported today in Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology.\n  The study, led by researchers from Baylor College of Medicine, analyzed a newly added order set in the electronic health record at the five hospitals that requires practitioners to choose an indication for the type of urine culture being ordered. The main goal for implementing the new order set was to reduce unnecessary testing and antibiotic treatment in patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria.\n  The primary outcome was the number of urine cultures performed at the hospitals before and after implementation of the new order set, adjusted for the number of total patient-days. The researchers also assessed antibiotic days of therapy (DOT), catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) rate, and the overall financial impact.\n  The total number of urine cultures at the five hospitals decreased from 32,598 before the new order set (June 2017 through May 2018) to 20,064 after (July 2018 through June 2019). Adjusted per patient-days, urine cultures decreased from 1,175.8 per 10,000 patient-days to 701.4 after the intervention (a 40.4% reduction). Antibiotic DOT for patients with a urinary tract infection fell from 102.5 to 86.9 per 1,000 patient-days (a 15.2% reduction), the CAUTI rate dropped from 11.5 to 9.3 per 10,000 catheter-days, and the estimated yearly savings following the intervention was $535,181.\n  The authors note that the results suggest the order set is not always being used correctly and that a follow-up quality improvement study may be warranted.\nMar 5 Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol abstract\n\nReview finds high antibiotic use, resistance on African farms  An meta-analysis of previously published research has found high levels of antibiotic use and resistance in food-producing animals and the environment in Africa, a team of Tanzanian researchers reported in Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control.\n  The researchers reviewed and analyzed 176 articles published from 2005 through 2018 and found that the percentage of farms using antibiotics ranged from 77.6% in Nigeria to 100% in Tanazania, Cameroon, Zambia, Ghana, and Egypt. In total, 14 different classes of antibiotics were used, mainly tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, and penicillins. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli isolates in food-animals ranged from 20% in Nigeria to 100% in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Tunisia, while the prevalence of MDR E coli in environmental samples ranged from 33.3% in South Africa to 100% in Algeria. Environmental E coli exhibited resistance to 16 different antibiotics.\n  The review also found that none of the countries studied had documented antibiotic use or antibiotic resistance surveillance programs specific for animals or the environment.\n  The authors of the study say the high levels of antibiotic use and resistance found in animal production systems in Africa is likely to escalate the already high prevalence of antibiotic resistance on the continent.\n  \"This, coupled with weak regulations and antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems in the region is a great concern to the animals, environment and humans as well,\" they wrote.\nMar 3 Antimicrob Resist Infect Control study",

Total cases rose by 31 since yesterday.\n  Many Washington state cases are linked to the Life Care long-term care facility outbreak in Kirkland, Washington. The latest death was in a woman in her 90s who was treated at EverGreenHealth in Kirkland.\n  Public health officials in King County issued new recommendations intended to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, including advising people 60 and older, pregnant women, and those with underlying health conditions to avoid public gatherings. The county said workplaces should encourage working from home if feasible, but it stopped short of making a recommendation to close all schools.\n  Neighboring Snohomish County officials, in a press conference today, also recommended limiting mass gatherings and advised people to stay home if sick. Officials said buses in the county are being sanitized today, and two senior centers are closed. Officials encouraged telecommuting, but also said school closing would not be declare until it was clear such closing would interrupt transmission.\nThis week Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft are some of the major Seattle companies to announce work-from-home policies for staff.\nNew York, California report more infections  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said today on Twitter that New York has 11 more cases than yesterday, raising the state's total to 22.

They subjectively ranked the legitimacy of the data, analyzed both the full dataset (28 patients) and a subset of pairs that had highest certainty in reporting (18 patients) and then adjusted for right truncation of the data because the epidemic is still growing.\nThey estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 3.1 to 4.9). When the data was limited to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI, 3.5 to 5.9). \"This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset,\" the authors wrote.\nThey add, \"The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.\"\nBecause of the shorter serial interval, \"contact tracing methods must compete against the rapid replacement of case generations, and the number of contacts may soon exceed what available healthcare and public health workers are able to handle,\" they wrote.\nOf the 28 infector-infectee pairs, 12 pairs were parts of family clusters.\nProtecting healthcare workers against COVID-19\n\nA robust, multifaceted response to the COVID-19 outbreak protected healthcare workers against the virus in a Hong Kong hospital, according to the second study, published today in Infection Control &amp; Hospital Epidemiology.\nLed by researchers at Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong, the study describes the hospital's infection control response in the first 42 days after a cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, was reported on Dec 31.\nThe hospital, like other public hospitals in Hong Kong, immediately stepped up its infection control procedures using enhanced laboratory surveillance, early airborne infection isolation, rapid molecular diagnostic testing, and contact tracing for healthcare workers who had been unprotected against exposure.\nWorkers were educated about personal protective equipment, infection control, and hand hygiene in staff forums and in-person sessions. When screening identified a patient infected with the coronavirus, he or she was immediately isolated in an airborne isolation room or a ward with at least one meter of space between patients.\nZero infections or deaths in hospital workers\n\nEleven unprotected healthcare workers out of 413 involved in treating patients with confirmed illness were quarantined for 14 days. No hospital workers were infected, and no hospital-acquired infections were identified after the first 6 weeks of the epidemic. This was despite the health system testing 1,275 patients with suspected infection and treating 42 patients with active, confirmed infection.\n\"Vigilance in hand hygiene practice, wearing of surgical masks in the hospital, and appropriate use of personal protective equipment in patient care, especially performing aerosol-generating procedures, are the key infection control measures to prevent nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [the COVID-19 virus],\" the authors wrote.\nThe investigators also collected air samples from near the mouth of a patient with a moderate viral load. The virus was not detected in any test, and tests of objects in the room detected it only on a window bench, suggesting that environmental transmission may not be as important as person-to-person transmission.\nSwift public health response in Hangzhou\n\nAlso today, investigators at the First People's Hospital at Zhejiang University School of Medicine published a letter in the same journal crediting public health efforts for rapid containment of the spread of COVID-19 in Hangzhou, China.\nThe city's COVID-19 cases climbed from an initial 6 on Jan 19 to 169 by Feb 27. In the last week that they studied, the number of new cases decreased sharply, and only 1 case was confirmed from Feb 17 to 20, according to the authors. There were no deaths among the patients.\nThe researchers used a regression of log\u2013incidence-over-time model to generate a fitted trajectory for daily incidence to prove the effects of the efforts, which began on Jan 23 with the launch of the highest level of emergency public health alert and response to limit people's movements.\nOn Feb 3, Hangzhou officials said only one family member was allowed to leave the family home and buy essentials outdoors every 2 days. At the same time, authorities implemented a package delivery method that involved no close contact with clients, which many express delivery companies adopted. Officials also urged employees and students to work online and arranged chartered transportation to help migrants return to their workplaces.\nOn Feb 11, Hangzhou implemented a system consisting of green, yellow, and red codes. People wanting to visit Hangzhou had to submit their travel history and health information online before they could do so. A green code indicated a low risk of infection, while residents with yellow or red codes had to be quarantined for 7 to 14 days and report their health condition daily before their code turned green.\nThe researchers said that their study shows that these efforts succeeded. \"Now this health surveillance system has been applied in most cities in Zhejiang province and then would be promoted to other provinces,\" they wrote.",

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "by Vincent Racaniello\n\n\nDriving the anxiety and uncertainty about the current outbreak of COVID-19 is the case fatality ratio (CFR) being thrown about carelessly by not just the press, but also WHO and other organizations. However the CFR is not a one-size-fits all, and is influenced by many factors.\n\nThe case fatality ratio for a disease is the number of fatalities divided by the number of confirmed infections. The latter number is typically obtained by laboratory diagnosis, in the current outbreak via RT-PCR, which detects viral nucleic acids. As of this writing this \u2018crude\u2019 global CFR for COVID-19 is 3214 deaths divided by 94,250 cases which is 3.4%. This crude CFR is high: for comparison, the CFR for seasonal influenza is 0.1%. However, as I will show below, this number is not a one-size-fits all, and is influenced by many factors. Please do not look at 3.4% as an indicator of your risk of dying from COVID-19!\n\nAs I\u2019ve written previously, data from the COVID-19 outbreak in China we know that age has a substantial impact on CFR. Based on a summary of 44,672 cases earlier in the outbreak (published by China CDC Weekly), no child between 0-9 years of age died of infection; and in individuals less than 50 years of age, the CFR is less than 1%. Only in older individuals does the CFR increase.\n\nWe also know that the CFR varied within China based on geographical location and even when in the outbreak the ratio is calculated. The graph included below (from the joint WHO-China mission on COVID-19 report) shows that at the beginning of January, the CFR was much higher in Wuhan than in other areas of China. This skewed CFR is due to lack of hospital care for the many infected individuals. In areas of China other than Wuhan, patients with serious disease could obtain excellent hospital care. Furthermore, the CFR declined during the course of the outbreak in China. This trend has been attributed to evolving standard of care during the outbreak.\nThe CFR also varies by country, likely due to differencesevolving standard of care during the outbreak. in the standard of care. In South Korea there have been 28 deaths among 5,621 infected individuals, for a CFR of 0.4%! In Singapore there have been 110 cases with no deaths. In comparison, in Italy and in Iran the CFR so far is 3.1%. These differences are not due to circulation of different viruses in these countries, but a combination of the quality of health care available and the age of the patients.\n\nSo far there have been 9 deaths out of 128 confirmed cases in the US, a fatality ratio of 7%. Many of these deaths have been in elderly individuals in Washington, which skews the CFR. Furthermore, it is obviously very early in this outbreak in the US. Given the overall good quality of health care in the US I suspect that the actual number will be much lower. However, if the hospitals in the US (or any other country) are overwhelmed, the CFR could be higher.\n\nFinally, I do think that we are missing many infections, not just in China but in other countries, and therefore the CFR may be even lower. There are likely many individuals with mild respiratory symptoms (typical in the winter) who are infected but never diagnosed. Only well after this outbreak is over, when serological studies are done to determine the extent of infection, will we have an accurate CFR.\n\nI am not attempting to minimize the seriousness of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: there will certainly be many infections in the US and there will be deaths due to the infection. However, please understand that a CFR of 3.4% does not apply to everyone; what happens to you if infected depends on your age, health status, and where you live.\n\nhttp://www.virology.ws/2020/03/05/sa...atality-ratio/",

The intent of this guidance is to facilitate preparedness and establish practices that can help people and animals stay safe and healthy. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets, can spread COVID-19. States may have their own specific requirements for these circumstances; this guidance provides recommendations for a conservative approach due to the unknown risks to pets and other animals. Guidance is based on the limited available data and general recommendations for zoonotic disease infection prevention and control. This is a rapidly evolving situation. Guidance will be updated as new information becomes available.  Considerations for COVID-19 patients under home care and isolation who have pets or other animals:People with COVID-19 should be advised to tell their public health point of contact that they have pets or other animals in their home.\n\nIn addition to other prevention measures, people with COVID-19 who are identified by public health officials as requiring home care and isolation should be advised to limit interaction with pets and other animals. Specifically, while these people are symptomatic, they should maintain separation from pets as they would with other household members, and avoid direct contact with pets, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. Service animals should be permitted to remain with their handlers.\n\nIf possible, a household member should be designated to care for pets in the home. If the individual in home care and isolation must care for pet(s), including service animals, they should ensure they wash their hands before and after caring for pets and wear a facemask while interacting with pets, until they are medically cleared to return to normal activities. At this point there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets, can spread COVID-19.When a public health professional is notified of a pet, or other animal, in the home of a person with COVID-19, they should notify the state public health veterinarianpdf iconexternal icon or other designated animal health professional.\n\nState public health veterinarians who have been contacted about pets or other animals potentially exposed to COVID-19 can consult with the CDC One Health Team 24/7 by calling CDC\u2019s Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100.\n\nThis is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.

The disease spread widely in China, and, as of February 26, 2020, COVID-19 cases had been identified in 36 other countries and territories, including the United States. Person-to-person transmission has been widely documented, and a limited number of countries have reported sustained person-to-person spread.* On January 20, state and local health departments in the United States, in collaboration with teams deployed from CDC, began identifying and monitoring all persons considered to have had close contact\u2020 with patients with confirmed COVID-19 (2). The aims of these efforts were to ensure rapid evaluation and care of patients, limit further transmission, and better understand risk factors for transmission.\n\nAs of February 26, 12 travel-related COVID-19 cases had been diagnosed in the United States, in addition to three COVID-19 cases in patients with no travel history (including two cases in close household contacts) and 46 cases reported among repatriated U.S. citizens.\u00a7 Following confirmed diagnosis, the 12 patients with travel-related COVID-19 were isolated in the hospital if medically necessary, or at home once home care was deemed clinically sufficient.\u00b6 Among the first 10 patients with travel-related confirmed COVID-19 reported in the United States, a total of 445 persons (range = 1\u2013201 persons per case) who had close contact with one of the 10 patients on or after the date of the patient\u2019s symptom onset were identified. Nineteen (4%) of the 445 contacts were members of a patient\u2019s household, and five of these 19 contacts continued to have household exposure to the patient with confirmed COVID-19 during the patient\u2019s isolation period; 104 (23%) were community members who spent at least 10 minutes within 6 feet of a patient with confirmed disease; 100 (22%) were community members who were exposed** to a patient in a health care setting; and 222 (50%) were health care personnel.\u2020\u2020\n\nActive symptom monitoring of the 445 close contacts, consisting of daily telephone, text, or in-person inquiries about fever or other symptoms for 14 days following the last known exposure to a person with confirmed COVID-19, was conducted by local health jurisdictions. During the 14 days of active symptom monitoring, 54 (12%) close contacts developed new or worsening symptoms deemed by local public health authorities to be concerning for COVID-19 and were thus considered persons under investigation (PUIs)\u00a7\u00a7 and subsequently were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Two persons who were household members of patients with confirmed COVID-19 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This yielded a symptomatic secondary attack rate of 0.45% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.12%\u20131.6%) among all close contacts,\u00b6\u00b6 and a symptomatic secondary attack rate of 10.5% (95% CI = 2.9%\u201331.4%) among household members. Both persons with confirmed secondary transmission had close contact with the respective source patient before COVID-19 was confirmed and were isolated from the source patient after the patient\u2019s COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\nNo other close contacts who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 had a positive test, including the five household members who were continuously exposed during the period of isolation of their household member with confirmed COVID-19. An additional 146 persons exposed to the two patients with secondary COVID-19 transmission underwent 14 days of active monitoring. Among these, 18 (12%) developed symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and were considered PUIs. All tested negative, and no further symptomatic COVID-19 cases (representing tertiary transmission) have been identified.\n\nIn the United States, two instances of person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have been documented from persons with travel-related COVID-19 to their household contacts. Since February 28, an increasing number of newly diagnosed confirmed and presumptive COVID-19 cases have been in patients with neither a relevant travel history nor clear epidemiologic links to other confirmed COVID-19 patients. However, despite intensive follow-up, no sustained person-to-person transmission of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the United States among the close contacts of the first 10 persons with diagnosed travel-related COVID-19. Analyses of timing of exposure during each patient\u2019s illness as well as the type and duration of exposures will provide information on potential risk factors for transmission. Infection control and prevention efforts by patients with COVID-19, their household members, and their health care providers,*** in combination with contact tracing activities, are important to mitigate community spread of the disease.\n\nTop AcknowledgmentsMaricopa County Department of Public Health; Arizona Department of Health Services; Lynn Mello, Mary White, Cynthia Marttila, Patricia Mottu-Monteon, Anthony Aguiar, Anita Alvarez, Veronica Guerra, San Benito County Public Health Services; Sara Cody, George Han, Shanon Smith, Elsa Villarino, Santa Clara County Public Health Department; Scott Lindquist, Washington State Department of Health; Hollianne Bruce, Snohomish Health District, Everett, Washington; Jeff Duchin, Vance Kawakami, Shauna Clark, Public Health Seattle-King County; Boston Public Health Commission; Sharon Balter, Dawn Terashita, Prabhu Gounder, Zach Rubin, Rebecca Fisher, Chelsea Foo, Meredith Haddix, Elizabeth Traub, Rebecca Lee, Kelsey Oyong, Christina Eclarino, Keith Gurtzweiler, Jennifer Kilburn, Jan King, Lucille Rayford, Ashley Griffin, Los Angeles County Department of Public Health; Howard Chiou, Los Angeles County of Public Health and COVID-19 Response Team, CDC; Rebecca Sunenshine, Maricopa County Department of Public Health and COVID-19 Response Team, CDC.

The duration of time in the same airspace after the patient with confirmed COVID-19 was applied differently by health jurisdictions. However, no contacts were enumerated among those who were in the same airspace >2 hours after the patient with confirmed COVID-19.\n\n\u2020\u2020 Health care personnel were defined as volunteers or paid persons who serve in a health care setting who might come into direct or indirect contact with patients or infectious materials. Examples of close contact with a patient or with infectious material could include spending prolonged time within 6 feet of the patient, conducting or being present during an aerosol-generating procedure, or direct contact with the patient\u2019s secretions or excretions. Interim guidance for assessing the exposure risk and for symptoms that should prompt further evaluation among health care personnel is available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...sment-hcp.html.\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 At the time of the investigations, persons with close contact to a confirmed COVID-19 patient could be considered PUIs if they developed fever or signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness. This threshold might be lower for contacts who are health care workers. At this time, symptomatic close contacts of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 should be further evaluated in consultation with public health authorities to review signs or symptoms and possible exposure on a case-by-case basis.

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "Time To Line Up A `Flu Buddy'\n\n\n#14,950\n\nI've just gotten off a Teleconference call with the CDC, and while I'll post a link to the audio file when it becomes available, I can tell you the CDC is now warning that it is not a matter of if COVID-19 will begin spreading in the United States . . . it's a matter of when.\nGranted, we don't know what that will look like - or how bad it might be - but the message coming today from Dr. Nancy Messonnier is that now is the time for everyone; government agencies, hospitals, businesses, and individuals to prepare. \n\nSince Dr. Ian Mackay and Dr. Katherine Arden wrote quite effectively about preparing for a pandemic earlier today (see So you think you\u2019re about to be in a pandemic?), I'll touch on the need to have one (or more) flu buddy.\n\nCOVID-19 admittedly isn't flu, but influenza is about as close of a corollary as we have right now, and as individuals, we are going to be dealing with it as if it were pandemic influenza. And that means - for many of us who will only have mild or moderate illness - we'll have to be treated at home by family or friends.\nAll well and good if you live with someone who can act as a caretaker, and who isn't sick at the same time that you are. \n\nBut more than 32 million Americans live alone (see chart below), and while many of those are younger people who are waiting later to get married, a side effect of our longer lifespan and high divorce rate is that many of these single households are held by those over the age of 65.\n\n\n\n\nWhether we live alone by choice or by happenstance, we all share a common vulnerability. If we get sick, or injured, there may be no one around to notice, or to help.\nAs a paramedic I saw a significant number of people who lived alone who either died, or spent miserable hours or even days incapacitated and unable to call for help, due to an illness or accident. \n\nAnother vulnerable group are households with only 1 adult, and minor children. This too is a growing demographic, with more than 5 million households falling into that category. If the adult falls seriously ill, then even more are potentially at risk.\n\n\nWhich is why, starting about 12 years ago, I pitched the idea that we should all have - and be - flu buddies. Simply put, a Flu Buddy is . . . .\nSomeone you can call if you get sick, who will then check on you every day (by phone, social media, or in person), make sure you have the food and medicines you need (including fetching prescriptions if appropriate), help care for you if needed, and who can call for medical help if your condition deteriorates.\nThose people who care for others, like single parents, also need to consider who will take care of their dependents if they are sick. \n\nAfter the 2009 pandemic, I expanded this idea into having - and being - a `Disaster Buddy' (see In An Emergency, Who Has Your Back?).  Someone who prearranges to help a friend, relative, or neighbor during a personal or local emergency.\nIn return, you could rely on them to help you if you needed it. It only works if it is reciprocal. \n\nMy `flu buddy' and I discussed the logistics of how we'll deal with this pandemic over the weekend. We'll stay in daily contact with one another by phone. If either of us run a fever, or develop symptoms, we'll up that to a call twice a day.\nWhile we won't unnecessarily expose each other to the virus, if either one of us becomes ill enough to need physical help, we'll visit each other at least once a day to make sure the other has what they need. We'll use surgical masks, and hand sanitizer for personal protection, and be as careful as we can. \n\nThe time to have this type of conversation with friends, relatives, and neighbors is now. If you don't feel comfortable actually caring for someone who is sick, you can at least promise to check on them daily, leave `care packages' at their front door, or even call an ambulance for them if necessary.\nThis is also time to update and print out a 1-page (or wallet-sized) medical history on yourself, and all members of your family (see Thanksgiving Is National Family History Day) in case you need to see a doctor who doesn't have your medical information. \n\nFrankly, having (and being) a `Disaster Buddy\u2019 to friends, neighbors, and relatives should be part of everyone\u2019s family disaster plan. Three years ago, I had to evacuate due to Hurricane Irma, and my disaster/flu buddy took me in for 5 days no questions asked.\nAlthough the government can do a lot during a pandemic, some of the simplest and most effective things we can do involve taking care of one another. \n\nWhile some people invest in a stockpile of freeze dried food, or buy the latest survival gadgets, and think themselves prepared . . . I can assure you that having people you can really depend on in an emergency is the greatest prep of all.",

The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control.\n\nMethods\n\nThe Shenzhen CDC identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases from January 14 to February 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts. We compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. We estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk.\n\nFindings\n\nCases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). Ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. Three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 32 days). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days. Household contacts and those travelling with a case where at higher risk of infection (ORs 6 and 7) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 15%, and children were as likely to be infected as adults. The observed reproductive number was 0.4, with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days.\n\nInterpretation\n\nOur data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. This work shows that heightened surveillance and isolation, particularly contact tracing, reduces the time cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing R. Its overall impact, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. We further show that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms; hence should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.\n\n\nCompeting Interest Statement\n\n\nThe authors have declared no competing interest.

The CDC specifically states \u201cIn the event of a discrepancy between CDC cases and cases reported by state and local public health officials, data reported by states should be considered the most up to date.\u201d The information presented here is derived from reports by local public health officials and new reports compiled by the ever diligent members of FluTrackers.  \n\nBecause of HIPAA laws specific case detailed are not publicly available.  In fact, there are reports that medical professionals have been restricted from obtaining cases details to help them better understand how to identify the disease and its effects on the human body.\n\nThe following information on the cases in the United States is derived from publicly available information as of March 5, 2020.  Not all cases have information relating to sex or age, although the county location of most cases has been identified. Among the 75 cases where the sex of the individual was reported, 41 (55%) are male, and 34 (45%) are female. Most of the cases with reported age fall within the age range of 50 to 80 years old.\n\n\n\nTwelve of the cases have died, the youngest was a male in his 40s who was also a teacher in Washington state. At least six of the reported cases are healthcare workers.\n\nThe map below shows the number of confirmed and presumptive cases in each of the state reporting coronavirus cases as of March 5, 2020.\n\n\n\nThe map below shows the distribution of counties across the United States that have reported local cases as of March 5, 2020.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe are now at a tipping point in the outbreak in the United States. Today King County in Washington state quit reporting individual cases and is now reporting cases in aggregate, 20 more today. In New York, an additional 8 cases were reported in aggregate from Westchester County. Within the next 24 to 48 hours, many more cases will be reported in aggregate counts. The long-awaited distribution of test kits will also quickly inflate the number of newly reported cases.  Hopefully, the CDC will soon return to its role of providing accurate information about the number of and geographic distribution of COVID-19 cases in the United States.",

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "There are 3 important things that any government must do if it wishes to survive a pandemic.\n\n1. Provide Accurate and Truthful Information\n\nAny government should provide accurate, current, and truthful information about the pandemic. Certainly, as a pandemic unfolds the situation changes rapidly. Government agencies and spokespeople should acknowledge the fluidity of the situation. Providing conflicting information from various agencies will lead to confusion among the general population. Covering up or misleading the public will lead to distrust of official announcements and recommendations. Dismissing or downplaying the serious potential of a pandemic can lead to fear and general anxiety. Failure of the government to provide truthful and accurate information can lead to panic and possibly mass hysteria. \n\nWhat can be done?\n\nProvide a unified voice from the government by public health officials who understand what is going on and have credibility with the public.  Let these public health officials speak freely and honestly about the parameters of the pandemic. Provide a daily update to the public by these individuals.\n\n A government should set up a national hotline with knowledgeable government employees taking calls and responding to any and all questions relating to the pandemic. Nothing can be more reassuring than talking to another human being about concerns and actions to take as a pandemic progresses.\n\n2. Provide Supplies and Protection for Health Care Workers\n\nA pandemic is a foreign invader, it cannot be stopped by soldiers or generals. The front-line defense against a pandemic are all of the healthcare workers and their support staff. These individuals include doctors, nurses, medical technicians, laboratory support staff, first responders, and the support and maintenance staff of health facilities. \n\nHealthcare staff and facilities around the world are working at capacity even before a pandemic begins. Healthcare staff of all specialties will be pressed into service to aid in treatment of pandemic cases. A pandemic will overwhelm staff and facilities. Just because there is a pandemic, regular medical issues will not go away. In addition to treating the influx of pandemic patients, other medical aspects such as caring for acute trauma, monitoring chronic conditions, assisting in births, etc. will continue to be necessary. \n\nWhat can be done?\n\nThe government should be responsible for making sure that adequate supplies such as masks, gowns, gloves, are available to all staff. Ample supplies of medications and tests should also be available. These health care workers need to be assured that they have all the resources they need to treat patients and not get sick themselves.\n\nHealth care workers should not be burdened by paperwork exercises, filling out forms, and looking up insurance codes. They should be 100% focused on taking care of sick people. \n\nHealthcare workers are the soldiers of a pandemic crisis. They can be subject to anxiety and psychological stress such as PTSD just like any other soldier. The government should do all it can to lessen the physical and psychological pressures and provide extensive crisis management for these healthcare workers. \n\n3. Have a Clear Pandemic Plan \n\nThe government needs to have a clear public plan in place for dealing with the myriad of problems that accompany a pandemic. Does the government have a rational plan for quelling concerns among the population? Is it ready to bolster weak links in the supply chain to ensure that critical infrastructure remains intact? Will adequate supplies of food, water, electricity, gas, and oil be properly delivered to people who are in desperate need?\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nThe government needs to have a coherent communication plan in place if various avenues of official news and information are disrupted.  One thing the government can do minimize the effect of a pandemic is to make sure that all treatment for the disease is free, no one should have to pay for treatment. Everyone should have equal opportunity for treatment and recovery. Any vaccination, when it becomes available, should be free to every citizen. \n\n A pandemic will eventually end. At that time the government will be responsible for bringing the broken pieces of the economy and society back together again. The government will need to have a massive deficit spending plan to jump start the economy once the pandemic is over. Extensive spending will be necessary to put people back to work and to bolster the supply chain and infrastructure in order return to a semblance regular life. Only then will the people begin to have faith  in the government and that things will eventually return to normal.\n\n\nAny government that does not address these 3 issues will not instill confidence in the general public. It would demonstrate that the government is incapable of managing a pandemic crisis. Failure to manage a pandemic crisis could result in more infections, poorer treatment, greater loss of life, and perhaps even a permanent lowering of the standard of living.",

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "Good afternoon, and thank you once again for joining us in person and online.\n\nToday I want to start by saying thank you to all our colleagues in the media. As providers of information, you play a vital role in the response to COVID-19.\n\nThe fight against rumours and misinformation is a vital part of the battle against this virus. We rely on you to make sure people have accurate information about the threat they face, and how to protect themselves and others.\n\nNow to the numbers.\n\nThere is now a total of 95,265 reported cases of COVID-19 globally, and 3281 deaths. \n\nIn the past 24 hours, China reported 143 cases. Most cases continue to be reported from Hubei province, and 8 provinces have not reported any cases in the last 14 days.\n\nOutside China, 2055 cases were reported in 33 countries. Around 80% of those cases continue to come from just three countries. \n\nWe see encouraging signs from the Republic of Korea. The number of newly-reported cases appears to be declining, and the cases that are being reported are being identified primarily from known clusters.\n\nAlthough a few countries are reporting large numbers of cases, 115 countries have not reported any cases. \n\n21 countries have reported only one case.\n\nAnd 5 countries that had reported cases have not reported new cases in the past 14 days.\n\nThe experience of these countries and of China continues to demonstrate that this is not a one-way street.\n\nThis epidemic can be pushed back, but only with a collective, coordinated and comprehensive approach that engages the entire machinery of government.\n\nWe are calling on every country to act with speed, scale and clear-minded determination.\n\nAlthough we continue to see the majority of cases in a handful of countries, we are deeply concerned about the increasing number of countries reporting cases, especially those with weaker health systems.\n\nHowever, this epidemic is a threat for every country, rich and poor. As we have said before, even high-income countries should expect surprises. The solution is aggressive preparedness.\n\nWe\u2019re concerned that some countries have either not taken this seriously enough, or have decided there\u2019s nothing they can do.\n\nWe are concerned that in some countries the level of political commitment and the actions that demonstrate that commitment do not match the level of the threat we all face. \n\nThis is not a drill.\n\nThis is not the time to give up.\n\nThis is not a time for excuses.\n\nThis is a time for pulling out all the stops.\n\nCountries have been planning for scenarios like this for decades. Now is the time to act on those plans.\n\nThese are plans that start with leadership from the top, coordinating every part of government, not just the health ministry \u2013 security, diplomacy, finance, commerce, transport, trade, information and more \u2013 the whole government should be involved.\n\nActivate your emergency plans through that whole-government approach.\n\nEducate your public, so that people know what the symptoms are and know how to protect themselves and others.\n\nIncrease your testing capacity.\n\nGet your hospitals ready.\n\nEnsure essential supplies are available.\n\nTrain your health workers to identify cases, provide careful and compassionate treatment, and protect themselves from infection.\n\nIf countries act aggressively to find, isolate and treat cases, and to trace every contact, they can change the trajectory of this epidemic.\n\nIf we take the approach that there\u2019s nothing we can do, that will quickly become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nIt\u2019s in our hands.\n\nWHO has published step-by-step guidelines for countries to develop their national action plans according to eight key areas, which are supported by detailed technical guidance.\n\nWe call on all countries to accelerate those plans, and we stand ready to work with them to do that.\n\nMore funding is being made available to support countries that need it, and that have plans in place.\n\nAs you know, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have both made funds available to stabilize health systems and mitigate the economic consequences of the epidemic, with a special focus on enabling access to critical supplies and equipment.\n\nI had also a very fruitful discussion with the President of the African Development Bank.\n\nThis is funding that is available now to countries who need it, in line with WHO\u2019s Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan.\n\nThese funds are essential for supporting the response now, but also for long-term preparedness.\n\nAlthough COVID-19 presents an acute threat now, it is absolutely essential that countries do not lose this opportunity to strengthen their preparedness systems.\n\nWe know people are afraid, and that\u2019s normal and appropriate.\n\nThat fear can be managed and moderated with accurate information. Today WHO has launched a new social media campaign called Be Ready for COVID-19, which urges people to be safe, smart and informed.\n\nIf you feel overwhelmed by fear, reach out to those around you. Find out what your community\u2019s emergency response plans are, how you fit in and how you can help. \n\nThere\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know, but every day we\u2019re learning more, and we\u2019re working around the clock to fill in the gaps in our knowledge.\n\nUltimately, how deadly this virus will be depends not only on the virus itself, but on how we respond to it.\n\nThis is a serious disease. It is not deadly to most people, but it can kill. \n\nWe\u2019re all responsible for reducing our own risk of infection, and if we\u2019re infected, for reducing our risk of infecting others.\n\nThere\u2019s something all of us can do to protect vulnerable people in our communities.\n\nThat\u2019s why we keep talking about solidarity.\n\nThis is not just a threat for individual people, or individual countries.\n\nWe\u2019re all in this together, and we can only save lives together.\n\nI thank you.\nhttps://www.who.int/dg/speeches/deta...--5-march-2020",

If the directions for use for viruses/virucidal activity list different contact times or dilutions, use the longest contact time or most concentrated solution. Application Information for Registrants Wanting an Emerging Viral Pathogen ClaimA company can apply for an emerging viral pathogens claim, even before an outbreak occurs, based on previously EPA-approved claims for harder-to-kill viruses. EPA reviews the supporting information and determines if the claim is acceptable. Once approved, a company can make certain off-label claims as specified in the policy in the event of an outbreak such as the SARS-CoV-2. For instance, the company can include an efficacy statement on:technical literature distributed to health care facilities, physicians, nurses, public health officials;\nnon-label-related websites;\nconsumer information services; and\nsocial media sites.\n\nCompanies with EPA-registered disinfectants that want their products added to List N, should provide the information as outlined below to disinfectantslist (disinfectantslist@epa.gov).Ensure that the product has a previously approved emerging viral pathogen claim.\nProvide the product name and EPA Registration number.\n\nNote: There may be additional disinfectants that meet the criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2. EPA will update this list with additional products as needed.\n\nYou may need a PDF reader to view some of the files on this page.

By February 26, 2020, over 80,000 people were infected and 2,814 died from the infection. The initial route of infection is the binding of the spike protein (S protein) of the virus to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). From bioinformatics analysis, we found that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 produced an evolutionary mutation of K403R compared with the S protein of SARS-CoV, forming an adjacent RGD motif at the interaction surface. As the RGD motif is considered as a ligand for many cell surface integrins, we proposed that the binding of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with integrins may facilitate the infection process of the virus. Therefore, high-throughput virtual screening was performed by choosing the key residues of S protein interface of SARS-CoV-2 and the adjacent RGD motif as potential binding site, to search for the potential agents targeting interaction of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with both ACE2 and integrins as potential therapeutic drugs. Various libraries including the FDA-approved drugs etc. were screened, and Nadide, Losartan, 9'''-Methyllithospermate B and Leonurine etc. were identified as representative potential drugs candidate for COVID-19.\n\nhttps://www.preprints.org/manuscript...EX8BNTrxgP4tPU",

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "As China claims very few Covid-19 cases now, it will be interesting to track the airborne nitrogen dioxide over China. If people are not working it will be an indicator that the Covid-19 problem is not over.  Airborne Nitrogen Dioxide Plummets Over China\nJanuary 1 - February 25, 2020\n\nNASA and European Space Agency (ESA) pollution monitoring satellites have detected significant decreases in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over China. There is evidence that the change is at least partly related to the economic slowdown following the outbreak of coronavirus.\n\nAt the end of 2019, medical professionals in Wuhan, China, were treating dozens of pneumonia cases that had an unknown source. Days later, researchers confirmed the illnesses were caused by a new coronavirus (COVID-19). By January 23, 2020, Chinese authorities had shut down transportation going into and out of Wuhan, as well as local businesses, in order to reduce the spread of the disease. It was the first of several quarantines set up in the country and around the world.\n\nThe maps on this page show concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, a noxious gas emitted by motor vehicles, power plants, and industrial facilities. The maps above show NO2 values across China from January 1-20, 2020 (before the quarantine) and February 10-25 (during the quarantine). The data were collected by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on ESA\u2019s Sentinel-5 satellite. A related sensor, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA\u2019s Aura satellite, has been making similar measurements.\n\nAccording to NASA scientists, the reduction in NO2 pollution was first apparent near Wuhan, but eventually spread across the country. Millions of people have been quarantined in one of the largest such actions in human history. As of February 28, 2020, the virus had been detected in at least 56 countries.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event,\u201d said Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center. Liu recalls seeing a drop in NO2 over several countries during the economic recession that began in 2008, but the decrease was gradual. Scientists also observed a significant reduction around Beijing during the 2008 Olympics, but the effect was mostly localized around that city, and pollution levels rose again once the Olympics ended.\n\nJanuary 1, 2019 - February 25, 2020\n\nThe drop in nitrogen dioxide in 2020 also coincided with Lunar New Year celebrations in China and much of Asia. Generally, businesses and factories close from the last week in January into early February to celebrate the festival. Past observations have shown that air pollution usually decreases during this period and then increases once the celebration is over.\n\n\u201cThere is always this general slowdown around this time of the year,\u201d said Barry Lefer, an air quality scientist at NASA. \u201cOur long-term OMI data allows us to see if these amounts are abnormal and why.\u201d Launched in 2004, OMI has been collecting global data on NO2 and various air pollutants for more than 15 years.\n\nThe maps above show NO2 values over three periods in 2020: January 1-20 (before Lunar New Year), January 28-February 9 (around New Year celebrations), and February 10-25 (after the event). The 2020 values are compared to the same periods in 2019 for reference. Lefer noted that the overall values in 2020 were lower than 2019 due to new environmental regulations that China has enforced over the past few years.\n\nWhile the Lunar New Year may have played a role in the recent dropoff, researchers believe the decrease is more than a holiday effect or weather-related variation. In a preliminary analysis, NASA researchers compared NO2 values detected by OMI in 2020 with the average amounts detected at this time of year from 2005-2019. In 2020, NO2 values in eastern and central China were significantly lower (from 10 to 30 percent lower) than what is normally observed for this time period.\n\nAdditionally, Liu and colleagues have not seen a rebound in NO2 after the holiday. \u201cThis year, the reduction rate is more significant than in past years and it has lasted longer,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not surprised because many cities nationwide have taken measures to minimize spread of the virus.\u201d\n\nNASA Earth Observatory images by Joshua Stevens, using modified Copernicus Sentinel 5P data processed by the European Space Agency.

Preprints 2020, 2020020315 (doi: 10.20944/preprints202002.0315.v1).\nAbstract\n\n\nThe spread of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) throughout the world has been a severe challenge for public health. The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has a remarkably high affinity binding to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). By the search for network database and re-analysis of pubic data, we found the level of ACE2 expression in adipose tissue was higher than that in lung tissue, which indicated the adipose tissue might be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 as well; the levels of ACE2 expressed by adipocytes and adipose progenitor cells were similar between non-obese individuals and obese individuals, but obese individuals have more adiposes so as to increase the number of ACE2-expressing cells; the expression of ACE2 in tumor tissues posed by five different types of cancers increased significantly compared with that in adjacent tissues. Thus, we suggest that more attentions might be given to obese individuals and the five types of cancer patients during the outbreak of COVID-19.

The median patient age was 46 years (range, 1 to 86 years), and the cases were split evenly between males and females.\n  To investigate the shift of the epidemic, the researchers compared patient characteristics before Jan 24 with those from Jan 25 to Feb 5. \"Compared with before Jan 24, the proportion of case-patients without definite exposure was much higher from Jan 25 through Feb 5 (11% vs. 6%; P < 0.001) and increased to 36% (12/33) on both Jan 31 and Feb 5,\" the authors wrote.\n  They also reported a sharp increase in the proportion of infected children (2% before Jan 24 to 13% for Jan 25 to Feb 5; P < 0.001), meaning that increased exposure for children and familial transmission could contribute substantially to the epidemic.\n  The researchers noted that the steep increase could be attributed to the low proportion of children exposed early in the outbreak; early detection for children who had had close contact with people with diagnosed or suspected infection after control measures were implemented; or failure to identify the relatively mild signs and symptoms in children, especially because resources were limited early in the Wuhan outbreak.\n  The investigators caution that delays from infection to illness onset or onset to confirmation may have biased the comparisons.\n  After Jan 17, infections increased substantially and peaked Jan 22 to 30. The authors said that the decline since then is probably due to both under-identification of cases of recent onset and delayed identification or reporting.\nInterval from exposure to symptom onset  Of 56 clusters of single co-exposure cases, the mean interval of symptom onset between the primary and second case-patient in a cluster was 3.1 days. The mean interval of symptom onset between the primary and last case-patient within a cluster was 3.6 days.\n  After strict control measures were implemented, the researchers observed a shortened span from illness onset to hospital visits (median days declined from 3 to 1; P < 0.001).\nRecommendations to contain spread  The investigators recommend that infected patients be treated at designated hospitals to decrease the risk of nosocomial transmission. However, they found that only 13% to15% of infected patients went to the city's designated hospital first. \"This finding means that a substantial number of case-patients visited >1 nondesignated hospital before they were admitted to the designated hospital, which increases the risk for nosocomial infection,\" they wrote.\n  \"Early screening, diagnosis, isolation, and treatment are necessary to prevent further spread,\" the researchers wrote. \"Strengthening effective and efficient measures, including but not limited to personal protection within families and communities with a high risk for exposure, will prevent and interrupt community and intrafamily transmission.\"\n  Shenzhen is a city of 13 million people in southern China.\nVaried CT, clinical findings  In the second study, researchers at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China, detailed the CT findings and clinical characteristics of six women 27 to 63 years old with COVID-19.\n  None of the patients had such underlying diseases as diabetes, cancer, or respiratory disease. Five had had Wuhan or Hubei exposures.\n  They found that COVID-19's wide variety of manifestations on CT can vary over time. Early in the disease, lesions can appear round and nodular in the central lung, unlike their common patchy appearance between the membrane surrounding the lung and the body wall. One patient had 3 follow-up scans 4 to 14 days later that showed diverse lesions and that the primary lesions had been absorbed and replaced elsewhere by new ones.\n  On testing blood samples, the researchers observed normal or slightly decreased counts of leucocytes and lymphocytes and identified mildly decreased eosinophil counts in four of the patients. Four days later, follow-up testing revealed that the low eosinophil counts remained abnormal and had dropped even further. \"The decrease of eosinophil count may be helpful for the early diagnosis of the disease,\" they wrote, calling for further study of the phenomenon.\n  They also commented on the high false-negative rate in the oropharyngeal swabs used to diagnose and confirm COVID-19 infection and called for an alternative technique to be developed as soon as possible.\nSerious symptoms unlikely in pregnancy, study finds  In other research news, pregnant women are not at increased risk of having severe symptoms of COVID-19 infection, according to an analysis of 147 women in Wuhan published Friday by the World Health Organization and China. \n  The analysis found that only 8% of the women had serious illness, and 1% were critically ill.\n  This is in contrast to other respiratory infections that easily infect pregnant women and can cause serious illness, with long-lasting consequences for them and their babies. While long-term effects on the babies are unknown, a small study published in February in The Lancet showed that the newborns of women infected with COVID-19 appeared healthy and virus-free after cesarean delivery and isolation from their mothers.",

And New York City noted a 10-person cluster.\n  None of the Los Angeles cases involving the novel coronavirus were linked to the city's first case, which was diagnosed in January. But all of the new cases were exposed after close contact with other known patients or had traveled to a coronavirus hot spot, the Los Angeles Times reported today. Declaring an emergency will allow LA County to ask the state and other counties for more money, if needed.\n  Also today, Placer County\u2014north of Sacramento\u2014announced a death from COVID-19 in an elderly patient with underlying health issues. The patient had been aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship, which departed Feb 10 from San Francisco and sailed to Mexico, returning Feb 21. This is California's first death related to the virus, and the nation's first death outside of the Seattle area.\n  \"While most cases of COVID-19 exhibit mild or moderate symptoms, this tragic death underscores the urgent need for us to take extra steps to protect residents who are particularly vulnerable to developing more serious illness, including elderly persons and those with underlying health conditions,\" said Placer County Health Officer Aimee Sisson, MD in a press statement. \n  Placer County said 10 healthcare workers and 5 emergency responders who came in close contact with the patient have been placed in quarantine.\nNine new cases in NYC cluster  In New York, nine more cases of the virus have been linked to a lawyer from Westchester County, including the man's neighbor (who drove him to the hospital), wife, son, and daughter. Late this afternoon, testing showed the neighbor's family, including three children, had also contracted the virus. Media in New York are reporting the voluntary school closings of the children's schools.\n  These new cases raise the total in New York to 11. Governor Andrew Cuomo said about 1,000 residents of Westchester County have been asked to self-quarantine, including at least 8 healthcare workers who took care of the lawyer at Lawrence Hospital.\n  A tracking map updated regularly by Johns Hopkins University shows there are now 153 COVID-19 cases in the United States, including 49 from repatriated Americans.\nWashington state reports 10th death, 12 new cases  In Washington state, officials confirmed another death, raising that state's total to 10. The death was reported in King County, the site of an outbreak linked to Life Care long-term care facility in Kirkland. King County also reported 10 more cases today, and neighboring Snohomish County recorded 2 more cases, lifting the state's total to 39 infections.\n  The Washington State Department of Health also tweeted today the COVID-19 outbreak is affecting blood supplies in the state. \"The COVID-19 outbreak is starting to impact the blood supply in WA. Anyone who is symptom-free is encouraged to donate blood!\" officials wrote.\n  Several other states also reported more cases today, including New Hampshire's second presumptive positive, in a man exposed to that state's first case. The first case-patient had been instructed to self-isolate, but had attended a private party, where she exposed the second case-patient.\nBroader testing, congressional funds Yesterday Vice President Mike Pence said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will now make coronavirus testing kits available upon any doctor's request. Physicians are encouraged to first rule out other respiratory viruses, such as influenza, before testing for COVID-19.\n  Finally today, the Washington Post reported that the House and the Senate have reached a deal on an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill to combat the coronavirus. The bill is expected to be signed by President Donald Trump by the end of the week. More than $3 billion in the bill is allocated to developing vaccines and therapeutics, and $1 billion is for medical supplies.",

It includes a combination of grants and low-interest loans for low-income countries and loans for middle-income countries, and it said the support will cover a range of interventions, from strengthening health services to conducting surveillance to training frontline health workers.\nItaly's deaths top 100  Italy's health ministry today reported 587 more cases, boosting its overall total to 3,089. Also, 28 more people died from their infections, pushing the country's fatality count to 107. Though cases have been reported in all 20 of Italy's regions, more than 2,700 of them are in three hard-hit northern regions: Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and Veneto.\n  Also today, the ministry announced the temporary closure of all schools and universities throughout the whole country, starting tomorrow and extending to Mar 15. Health officials have distributed 25,000 surgical masks to 11 \"red zone\" cities, 10 in Lombardy and 1 in Veneto, for people with confirmed or suspected infections. It said it also distributed masks with filters to health personnel in all of Italy's regions.\n  In a related development, Italy's government has ordered all sporting events to take place without spectators until April 3, according to media reports.\n  So far, 36 European region countries have reported nearly 3,500 cases, at least 85 of them fatal, according to an online dashboard from the World Health Organization (WHO) European regional office. Italy has the most, with Germany, France, and Spain as the next hardest-hit countries.\n  The newest countries to report their first cases include Hungary, Liechtenstein, and Poland. Hungary's cases involve two students from Iran, Liechtenstein's patient had contact with a sick person from abroad, and Poland's patient had traveled from Germany.\nIran outbreak affects religious practices  Iran's health ministry today reported 586 more cases, plus 15 more deaths, pushing its respective totals to 2,922 and 92. Of the latest cases, about half are from Tehran province. A WHO-led mission arrived in Iran 2 days ago to assess the situation, offer support, and provide protective gear.\n  The country's state news agency today announced that the government has cancelled Friday prayers in all major cities, Xinhua reported.\n  The country's outbreak, as well as those in other hot spots, had led to several imported cases in other countries, and due to ongoing travel spread of the virus, Saudi Arabia's government today announced a temporary ban on Umrah pilgrimages. The country confirmed its first case earlier this week, which involved a traveler from Iran. Today it reported its second case, a Saudi citizen who returned from Iran via Bahrain, according to an Arab News report.\n  The WHO's Eastern Mediterranean regional office today said 15 of the region's member countries have reported 3,137 cases,  most of them from Iran, with Kuwait and Bahrain each reporting more than 50 cases.\nSouth Korea increase leads rising Asian totals  South Korea today reported 586 new cases, raising its total to 5,328. Four more deaths were reported, putting the fatality count at 32, according to the latest update from Korea Center for Disease Control. Daegu is still the country's main hot spot, accounting for about 4,000 confirmed infections. Much of the activity is linked to a large church cluster and some hospital outbreaks, but South Korea has also reported nursing home outbreaks, workplace clusters, smaller church clusters, and illnesses linked to sports facility and at least one travel tour.\n  China today reported 119 new cases, all but 4 from Hubei province, lifting the overall outbreak total to 80,270, according to an update from the National Health Commission. Officials also reported 38 more deaths and 390 fewer serious cases, putting those respective totals at 2,981 and 6,416.\n  Japan today reported 30 new cases, plus 3 asymptomatic carriers, bringing its total to 287 and reflecting a modest but steady rise in cases, according to the latest daily update from the health ministry. It lists is overall total at 317, which includes 30 asymptomatic carriers. The new cases are from 11 different prefectures.\n  Malaysia today reported 14 new cases today, its biggest 1-day jump, which raisesits overall total to 50, the Straits Times reported today. Most of the new cases are linked to an earlier confirmed case. And Singapore's health ministry today reported two new cases, one linked to an earlier patient, raising its total to 112.",

Those findings continue trends observed in previous surveillance reports.\n  The data, submitted by 28 EU member states from routine surveillance monitoring conducted in 2017 and 2018, also show that more than 28% of Salmonella isolates from human infections are multidrug-resistant.\n  The summary report focuses on antibiotic resistance levels in Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus\u2014the main infection-causing pathogens that pass from food-producing animals to people. The bacteria analyzed are from humans, pigs, calves, broiler chickens, and turkeys, with additional analysis of isolates recovered from poultry meat.\nSalmonella and Campylobacter are two of the leading bacterial causes of foodborne disease in people. While most cases of salmonellosis and campyblobacteriosis don't require antibiotics, ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, is commonly used to treat more severe infections.\nResistance common in Salmonella, Campylobacter  In Salmonella obtained from humans, the overall proportion of isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin was 12.5%, with extremely high proportions of resistance found in specific Salmonella serovars, including Salmonella Kentucky (87.5%). Resistance to high concentrations of ciprofloxacin in certain types of Salmonella rose from 1.7% in 2016 to 4.6% in 2018.\n  As in previous years, high proportions of human Salmonella isolates were also resistant to sulfonamides (30.5%), tetracyclines (28.8%), and ampicillin (25.9%)\u2014antibiotics that are commonly used in food-animal production. Resistance to these antibiotics was particularly high in Salmonella serovars commonly found in pigs.\n  Monitoring of human infections also detected a handful of cases of carbapenem-resistant Salmonella\u2014the first reports of carbapenem-resistant Salmonella in people that were not related to travel outside the EU.\n  \"Finding carbapenem resistance in foodborne bacteria in the EU is a concern,\" ECDC Chief Scientist Mike Catchpole, PhD, said in a press release.\n  In Salmonella and indicator E coli isolates recovered from animals and food, the findings were similar, with resistance to ampicillin, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines frequently detected. In addition, resistance to fluoroquinolones was high in Salmonella and E coli from broilers, turkeys, and poultry meat, and multidrug-resistance was observed at high levels in Salmonella recovered from the carcasses of pigs (47.4%), broilers (32.7%), and calves (22%).\n  In Campylobacter bacteria recovered from human infections, surveillance found that the EU average for ciprofloxacin resistance in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli\u2014the two species of focus for resistance monitoring\u2014was 59.3% and 65.2%, respectively. Combined resistance to ciprofloxacin and erythromycin (another important drug for treating campylobacteriosis) was low in C jejuni (1%) and moderate in C coli (11%).\n  But Estonia, Finland, Italy, and Spain reported combined resistance in more than 20% of C coli isolates, while Portugal reported combined resistance in more than 50% of C coli isolates. Combined resistance to ciprofloxacin and erythromycin is significant because it leaves few options for treating severe Campylobacter infections.\nSome encouraging findings  Among the encouraging findings from the report are decreasing trends in the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or AmpC-producing E coli in food-producing animals in 12 countries from 2015 through 2018, an important finding given the ability of ESBL/AmpC-producing E coli to cause severe, multidrug-resistant infections people. In addition, increasing trends in susceptibility to all antibiotics in E coli from food-producing animals was observed in 6 countries.\n  EFSA officials say these findings indicate that some countries are seeing success in efforts to reduce antibiotic resistance in food-animal production.\n  \"The positive findings in food-producing animals are encouraging because they are a sign of improvement,\" EFSA Chief Scientist Marta Hugas, PhD, said. \"However, we need to further investigate the reasons behind this change.\"",

The MOH listed the case as primary, meaning he is unlikely to have contracted the virus from another person. The patient is not a healthcare worker.\n  Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe illness and death. The virus can transmit between humans but has done so mainly in healthcare settings, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n  As of Jan 31, 2020, the WHO said that it had received reports of 2,519 laboratory-con\ufb01rmed MERS infections, including 866 associated deaths. The vast majority of these cases occurred in Saudi Arabia.\nMar 4 Saudi MOH report\n\nAvian flu outbreaks strike poultry in Taiwan and Bulgaria  Two countries reported more avian flu outbreaks in poultry: Taiwan, involving three different subtypes, and Bulgaria with a pair of new highly pathogenic H5N8 outbreaks, according to the latest reports from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).\n  In Taiwan, animal health officials reported two more highly pathogenic H5N2 outbreaks in native chickens, which began in the middle of February in Kaohsiung City and Pingtung County. Taken together, the virus killed 9,193 of 39,367 susceptible birds, and the rest were culled as part of the outbreak response. The region has been battling high-path H5N2 outbreaks since 2015. Also, authorities reported one more low-pathogenic H5N2 outbreak, which struck a poultry farm in Chiayi County and began on Feb 1, killing 1,500 of 20,000 chickens, with culling slated for the survivors.\n  Also, in a separate development, Taiwan reported four more outbreaks involving highly pathogenic H5N5 avian flu, part of activity that began in September 2019. The outbreaks began from Feb 7 to Feb 21, and two were detected at slaughterhouses. Combined, the outbreaks killed 361 of 12,123 susceptible birds. The rest were destroyed to slow the spread of the virus.\n  Bulgaria, meanwhile, reported two more outbreaks involving H5N8, both on farms in the city of Plovdiv. The events started on Mar 2, killing a total of 40 of 8,620 susceptible birds. The surviving poultry were culled.\nMar 3 OIE report on high-path H5N2 in Taiwan\nMar 3 OIE report on low-path H5N2 in Taiwan\nMar 3 OIE report on high-path H5N5 in Taiwan",

The study, published today in Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology, was led by members of the SHARPS Collaborative based at Washington University in St. Louis.\n  The researchers collected chart data from the hospitals' electronic medical records from September 2016 to December 2017, identifying 1,324 children receiving antibiotics (cefazolin, clindamycin, vancomycin, cefoxitin, and piperacillin/tazobactam) for surgical prophylaxis.\n  Overall, 485 prophylactic antibiotics were classified as inappropriate because of administration longer than 24 hours (n = 387, 79.8%), no indication for prophylaxis (32, 6.6%), and the use of antibiotics that were too broad spectrum (29, 6.0%).\n  National guidelines give procedure-specific recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis, including drug and dosing, to prevent surgical-site infections. \"The 2017 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guideline recommends only a single dose of perioperative prophylaxis for clean and clean-contaminated cases,\" the authors wrote. \"Despite these guidelines, inappropriate surgical prophylaxis use continues to be common.\"\n  Inappropriate surgical prophylaxis was highest in otolaryngologic patients (62.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 52.6% to 72.1%), cosmetic or reconstructive surgery patients (40.7%; 95% CI, 30.0\u201352.2), and neurosurgery patients (40.3%; 95% CI, 34.2% to 46.6%).\n  Of the 485 prescriptions deemed inappropriate, 258 (53.2%) would not have been routinely reviewed by the hospitals' antimicrobial surgical programs, according to the authors. The hospitals' use of inappropriate prophylaxis varied significantly, from 0.0% to 62.8%.\n  The study likely underestimated the percentages of inappropriate use, considering the new CDC recommendation of no antibiotics for low-risk procedures, the investigators said. They called for more studies to better estimate the inappropriate prophylaxis rate, identify contributing factors, and determine the best ways to optimize prophylactic use of antibiotics.\nMar 4 Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol study\n\nStudy: De-escalation rates low in hospitalized pneumonia patients  An analysis of adults with pneumonia at 164 US hospitals has found that less than 15% of those treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics had their coverage de-escalated by day 4, researchers reported today in Clinical Infectious Diseases.\n  The study, conducted by researchers with Cleveland Clinic and the University of Massachusetts Medical School, aimed to assess de-escalation practices in a cohort of hospitalized pneumonia patients after negative cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n  New guidelines from the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America recommend switching from broad-spectrum to narrower-spectrum antibiotics at 48 hours if microbial cultures do not reveal these multidrug-resistant pathogens and the patient is improving. The researchers wanted to know to what degree hospitals will have to change their practices to adhere to this recommendation.\n  The study\u2019s primary outcome was de-escalation on hospital day 4. The researchers also looked at the association of de-escalation with all-cause mortality, transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU), length of hospital stay, and costs.\n  Of the 14,170 pneumonia patients treated with one anti-MRSA and at least one anti-pseudomonal antibiotic from 2010 through 2015, both antibiotics were de-escalated in 1,924 patients (13%) by day 4. Hospital de-escalation rates ranged from 2% to 35% and varied across regions, but de-escalation was more common in large teaching hospitals.\n  At hospitals in the top quartile of de-escalation, rates of de-escalation were less than 50%\u2014even in patients at lowest risk for death. In propensity-adjusted analysis, patients with de-escalation had lower odds of subsequent transfer to the ICU (adjusted odds ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.79), shorter hospital stays (adjusted ratio of means, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.78), and costs (adjusted ratio of means, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.76).\n  The authors of the study concluded that, in order to adhere to the new guidelines, physicians will need to substantially change their response to negative cultures for most non-critically ill patients. \"Since antibiotics are not benign, and antimicrobial stewardship is an important priority, hospital antibiotic stewardship programs should emphasize de-escalation following negative cultures as an opportunity to reduce exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics, improving both antimicrobial stewardship and medication safety by substitution of lower-toxicity agents,\" they wrote.\nMar 4 Clin Infect Dis abstract",

However, there is an increasing number of cases without a defined chain of transmission. Extraordinary public health measures have been implemented in Italy and other EU/EEA countries and the UK, and strong efforts are being made to identify, isolate and test contacts in order to contain the outbreak. Despite contact tracing measures initiated to contain further spread, there continue to be cases exported between EU/EEA countries, and an increasing number of sporadic cases across EU/EEA countries. The probability of further transmission in the EU/EEA and the UK is considered high. There is still a level of uncertainty regarding several unpredictable factors in a situation that is still evolving.\nThe possibility of new introductions from other countries outside China into the EU/EEA appears to be increasing as the number of countries reporting cases continues to rise. A list of these countries can be found here.\nThe evidence from analyses of cases to date is that COVID-19 infection causes mild disease (i.e. non-pneumonia or mild pneumonia) in about 80% of cases and most cases recover, 14 % have more severe disease and 6% experience critical illness. The great majority of the most severe illnesses, and deaths, have occurred among the elderly and those with other chronic underlying conditions. In addition to the public health impacts with substantial fatal outcomes in high-risk groups, COVID-19 outbreaks can cause huge economic and societal disruptions.\nThe risk of acquiring the disease for people from the EU/EEA and the UK travelling/resident in areas with no cases, or multiple imported cases, or limited local transmission, is currently considered low to moderate   This is assuming surveillance in the area is activated, tests are carried out on suspected cases and that there is sufficient testing capacity in the area. If these surveillance and case detection conditions are not met, the risk is considered moderate to high, but with a high level of uncertainty.\nThe risk for people from the EU/EEA and the UK travelling/resident in areas with more widespread local transmission is currently considered to be high   This assessment is based on the following factors:The overall number of reported cases in areas with more widespread local transmission is high or increasing. However, there are significant uncertainties regarding transmissibility and under-detection, particularly among mild or asymptomatic cases.\nThe evidence from analyses of cases to date is that COVID-19 infection causes mild disease (i.e. non-pneumonia or mild pneumonia) in about 80% of cases and most cases recover, 14 % have more severe disease and 6% experience critical illness. The great majority of the most severe illnesses and deaths have occurred among the elderly and those with other chronic underlying conditions. The areas with local transmission are also likely to increase as importations in unaffected areas keep occurring.\nThe risk of the occurrence of clusters associated with COVID-19 in other countries in the EU/EEA and the UK is currently considered moderate to high   This assessment is based on the following factors:The current event in Italy indicates that local transmission may have resulted in several clusters. The accumulated evidence from clusters reported in the EU/EEA and the UK indicates that once imported, the virus causing COVID-19 can be transmitted rapidly. It is plausible that a proportion of transmissions occur from cases with mild symptoms that do not provoke healthcare-seeking behaviour. The increase in case numbers and the number of countries outside China reporting those cases increases the potential routes of importation of the infection into the EU/EEA and the UK. Importations from other European countries have already occurred.\nThe impact of such clusters in the EU/EEA would be high, especially if hospitals were affected and a large number of healthcare workers had to be isolated. The impact on vulnerable groups in the affected hospitals or healthcare facilities would be severe, in particular for the elderly.\nThe rigorous public health measures that were implemented immediately after identifying the Italian COVID-19 cases will reduce but not exclude the probability of further spread.\nThe risk of widespread and sustained transmission of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK in the coming weeks is moderate to high with more countries reporting more cases and clusters   This assessment is based on the following factors:There is an increasing number of countries with local or widespread local transmission around the world and in Europe that are exporting cases to unaffected areas. These exportations have caused transmission in previously unaffected areas. The control measures have up to now been able to only slow the further spread, but not to stop it.\nCases with mild symptoms are numerous and able to transmit the infection. Cases with mild symptoms are not always aware of their potential infectivity and have sought medical care, infecting healthcare workers.\nPreviously unaffected areas are reporting cases with travel history to a country that did not appear to have widespread local transmission.\nThe WHO increased their assessment of the risk of spread and the risk of impact of COVID-19 to very high at a global level.\nThe risk for healthcare system capacity in the EU/EEA and the UK in the coming weeks is considered moderate to high.   This assessment is based on the following factors:As the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK is increasing, the probability of widespread infection is increasing from low to moderate.\nThe majority of countries reported widespread influenza activity for week 8/2020, but the proportion of specimens tested positive in sentinel surveillance is slightly decreasing; some EU/EEA countries might have already moved past the peak period of high influenza circulation. For the latest influenza update see the joint ECDC\u2013WHO/Europe weekly influenza update.\nIf there is a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in the coming weeks, the potential impact on the public health and overall healthcare systems would be high. Increasing numbers of imported cases and local transmission chains would require additional resources for case management, surveillance, and contact tracing. Risk communication to concerned members of the public and healthcare professionals would tie up further resources. Further increased transmission could result in a significant increase of hospital admissions at a time when healthcare systems are may already be under pressure from the current influenza season. This would be exacerbated if substantial numbers of healthcare workers became infected. Specimens for COVID-19 could therefore lead to bottlenecks not only in healthcare but also in diagnostic capacity. Containment measures intended to slow down the spread of the virus in the population are therefore extremely important as outlined below in the \u2018Options for response\u2019 and recent ECDC guidance documents.",

The Strategic National Stockpile, the nation\u2019s emergency stockpile of drugs and medical supplies, currently holds approximately 12 million medical-grade N95 respirator masks and 30 million surgical face masks, according to an HHS spokesperson. That\u2019s a small fraction of the number of masks needed in a pandemic scenario. So-called N95 masks are preferred by medical professionals because they filter out about 95% of all liquid or airborne particles.\n\nHealth and Human Services official Dr. Robert Kadlec apparently misspoke while testifying Tuesday before the Senate health committee, repeating Republican Sen. Mitt Romney\u2019s incorrect math when he asked Kadlec: \u201cWhat percent of what would be needed by medical professionals if we were to have a full-blown pandemic?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it were to be a severe event, we would need 3.5 billion N95 respirator masks.

Herein, we investigated the extent of molecular divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses. Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated. Our results suggest that the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike seen in SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs are likely caused by mutations and natural selection besides recombination. Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date. Although the L type (\u223c70%) is more prevalent than the S type (\u223c30%), the S type was found to be the ancestral version. Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020. Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly. On the other hand, the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure. These findings strongly support an urgent need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and chart records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/nsr/advance...-OfeqaK0BeKVCw",

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "A Tale of Two Outbreaks: Hong Kong & Italy\n\n\nFlattening the Curve - Credit CDC\n\n\n\n#15,024\n\n\nUp until two weeks ago Italy had but 3 known COVID-19 cases. Today the ECDC reported they had in excess of 2,500 cases, and they have also reported 80 deaths. \nBy contrast, Hong Kong - which not only shares a border with Mainland China, but has been dealing with cases since mid-January - has only recently passed the 100 case mark. Across the bay, Macao has even fewer cases (n=10). \nIf you had asked anybody a month ago which of these two regions would have the most cases in early March, few would have picked Italy. Granted Italy has a much larger population than Hong Kong, but even so, the choices made by both governments have made the biggest difference.\n\nHong Kong has been very proactive in their response, and closed its schools when they had fewer than 40 cases - have kept them shuttered since late January - and intend to keep them closed until mid April at the earliest.\nItaly, on the other hand, only today announced a limited - two week - closure of schools across the country. \nHong Kong closed most public venues - museums, sporting events, movie theatres, bars and most restaurants - in late January (see HK Epidemic Measures: Curbing Travel From Mainland - Closing Public Places - Work From Home Orders) and has kept them closed.\nItaly - not so much.  \nA few temporary cancellations of sporting events in the hardest hit regions, but nothing like the response we've seen in Hong Kong. There are signs, at least over the past couple of days, that Italy may be taking stronger actions - like canceling more sporting events, and the aforementioned closing of schools - but they may be both too `measured' and too late to have much impact.\n\nThere appear to be two philosophies at work here.In Hong Kong, they assumed the disease was already in the community, and they not only continued to work to prevent further entry, they put very tough measures in place to prevent its spread.\nItaly, on the other hand, has been mostly reactive. Waiting for community spread to become obvious, and then dealing with each outbreak as if it were a limited event, rather than a systemic problem.\n\nSo far, at least outside of Asia, most countries have been following a reactive strategy.\n\nHong Kong has, admittedly, taken a huge financial hit by being proactive. And not just for big corporations, but for every resident in the city. So much so that the HK government has agreed to pay out 10,000 HKD to every resident over the age of 18, to ease the economic pain.\n\nAnd there are no guarantees on how long they can keep these difficult community mitigation measures intact - or that they won't see just as big of an epidemic a month or two from now - when they are eventually relaxed.\n\nBy waiting, Italy may have forestalled their economic hit by a few weeks - but any savings will likely evaporate with their worsening epidemic.\nEconomically, it appears to be a case of damned if you do, and damned if you don't. \nPerhaps in a year or two, we'll have enough data to know which option was least painful; at least economically. And we won't know until it's over whether Hong Kong's strategy results in fewer cases and deaths, or simply delays the inevitable.\nIf there is a tiebreaker - at least for now - it has to be that Hong Kong has bought more time to prepare, and has (so far) limited the strain on their healthcare system. \nIn 2017's Community Pandemic Mitigation's Primary Goal : Flattening The Curve, we look at the HHS/CDC's 2017 revised Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza, which outlined ways that communities can slow the spread of an epidemic, and hopefully reduce its impact.\nThe downside is - if successfully implemented - it may double or even triple the length of a pandemic wave. And that can have profound economic and societal impacts. \nYou hope to trade a shorter, steeper, and more severe pandemic for a longer, but more moderate pandemic wave. Something our society - including our healthcare delivery system - is better able to cope with. And that means more people can be saved.\nTheoretically, anyway. \nWhile I tend to favor a forward-leaning, proactive approach - in all honesty - I have no idea which approach will turn out the `best'. Or at least, least-worst. \n\nSince we seem to be seeing both approaches being tried around the world, over the next year or two we should get a much better idea what works best. Although results may vary depending on each country's resources and cultural norms.\n\nHopefully, whatever we learn, it will help guide us in the pandemic-after-next. \n\nhttps://afludiary.blogspot.com/2020/...ong-italy.html",

The first case of measles was recorded in week 5 of 2019 (week commencing 28 January 2019) and the outbreak has continued through to week 7 of 2020 (week commencing 10 February 2020), with eighteen health districts affected including twelve newly affected in 2020 (Bimbo, B\u00e9goua, Bangui I, Bangui II and Bangui III in the urban area, Boss\u00e9mb\u00e9l\u00e9, Bouar, Bozoum, Baboua-Abba, Haute-Kotto, Nangha-Boguila, and Ouango-Gambo in the rural area). \n\nFrom 1 January 2019 through 16 February 2020, a total of 7,626 suspected cases including 83 deaths (case fatality rate 1.08%) were reported. A large proportion of cases (72%) were below five years old and 18% of cases were between 5 and 10 years old. A total of 1,167 samples from suspected cases were tested at the reference laboratory of the Institut Pasteur in Bangui, of which 180 were positive for measles using Immunoglobulin M (IgM).\n\nThe low vaccination coverage for routine measles vaccine over the past 5 years (below 60% for the first dose at 9 months), the absence of a second measles vaccine dose in the national immunization schedule, and inadequate follow-up campaigns resulted in a high proportion of people susceptible to measles, contributing to the ongoing epidemic. All 35 health districts are at risk of a measles outbreak, and without adequate response, the epidemic could spread through the entire country. The number of districts affected by the measles outbreak is increasing, and as of 1 March 2020, 15 health districts have been affected: Alindao, Alindao-Mingala, Baboua-Abba, Bambari, Bangui I, Bangui II, Bangui III, B\u00e9goua, Bimbo, Bococaranga-Koui, Boss\u00e9mb\u00e9l\u00e9, Bouar, Bozoum, Haute-Kotto, Nangha-Boguila, Ngaoundaye, and Ouango-Gambo. \n\nIn December 2019, outbreaks affected eight health districts, and the country organized local measles vaccination campaigns that targeted children aged 6 to 59 months in seven districts (Bambari, Batangafo, Bocaranga-Koui, Grimari-Kouango, K\u00e9mo, Ngaoundaye, and Nana-Gribizi). Despite vaccination coverage of more than 95%, as confirmed by the vaccination coverage survey, new cases are being recorded in these districts and neighboring health districts in children aged from 5 to 15 years old. Based on the age distribution of cases as indicated by epidemiological investigations, the proposed vaccination strategy is to target the risk group from 6 months to 10 years to help stop transmission.  Public health responseSince the official declaration of the outbreak by Ministry of Health on 24 January 2020, the following public health actions have been conducted:COUSP (Center for Emergency Operations in Public Health) and the Local Crisis Committee have been activated to coordinate the response.\nThe Ministry of Health with support from WHO and other partners are developing a comprehensive response plan, which includes the vaccination campaigns.\nEpidemiological surveillance in the affected areas has been strengthened.\nReferral system of severe measles cases to the district health hospital has been set up with free care being offered to measles cases.\nDistribution of drugs and medical supplies to support provision of free medical care is ongoing.\nIsolation units have been established at the district hospital.\nThe routine immunization program is being strengthened.\nHealth promotion and risk communication activities are ongoing.\nEfforts are underway to mobilize resources to respond to the outbreak.\nWHO risk assessmentWHO estimates the overall risk for the CAR from the current measles outbreak to be \u201chigh\u201d due to the following reasons:The geographic expansion of the epidemic into new health districts.\nThe large number of districts with high risk for measles outbreaks, due to low vaccination coverage.\nAn increase in the number of cases reported in 2019 compared to 2018.\nThe security context of the country which limits access to set up rapid response measures in affected health districts.\nThe lack of infrastructure, inputs and resources to ensure free health care.\nThe lack of trained staff available for the clinical management of complications of measles.\nSuboptimal measles-containing-vaccine first-dose (MCV1) vaccination coverage of 49% for the past 5 years according to joint WHO / UNICEF estimates, and administrative coverage of 71% in 2019.\nLarge population movements between vaccinated and unvaccinated localities.\n\nRisk at the regional level is assessed as moderate given the large cross border movements of populations to and from neighboring countries including Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroon, both for security reasons and commercial activities. \n\nThe risk is considered low at the global level.  WHO recommendationsMeasles is a vaccine-preventable disease and two doses of measles-containing-vaccine (MCV) are recommended to ensure immunity.\n\nWHO urges all Member States to:Ensure routine measles vaccination for children combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case and death rates to reduce deaths due to measles.\nReach and maintain coverage of 95% and more with the first and second dose of MCV.\nVaccinate at-risk populations including young children, pregnant women, health workers, people working in tourism and transportation and international travelers.\nStrengthen epidemiological surveillance of fever / rash cases for timely detection of all suspected cases of measles in public and private healthcare facilities and ensure that samples are received by laboratories within five days of being taken.\nInclude the administration of Vitamin A to children in addition to measles vaccination as this is a key public health strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality due to measles infection and to interrupt transmission.\nWHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to the Central African Republic based on the information available on the current outbreak.\n\nFor more information on measlesWHO Measles factsheet\nWHO / UNICEF immunization routine immunization estimates",

Two patients who recently underwent lung lobectomies for adenocarcinoma were retrospectively found to have had COVID-19 at the time of surgery. These two cases thus provide important first opportunities to study the pathology of COVID-19. Pathologic examinations revealed that, apart from the tumors, the lungs of both patients exhibited edema, proteinaceous exudate, focal reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes with patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration, and multinucleated giant cells. Hyaline membranes were not prominent. Since both patients did not exhibit symptoms of pneumonia at the time of surgery, these changes likely represent an early phase of the lung pathology of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

Methods: By means of Weibull, Gamma and Lognormal distributions methods, we estimated the probability distribution of the incubation period and generation interval data obtained from the reported COVID-19 cases. Moreover, the AIC criterion was used to determine the optimal distribution. Considering the epidemic is ongoing, the exponential growth model was used to fit the incidence data of COVID-19 from 10 to 31 January, 2020, and exponential growth method, maximum likelihood method and SEIR model were used to estimate the basic reproduction number. Results: Early COVID-19 cases kept an increase in exponential growth manner before 26 January, 2020, then the increase trend became slower. The average incubation period was 5.01 (95%CI: 4.31-5.69) days; the average generation interval was 6.03 (95%CI: 5.20-6.91) days. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 3.74 (95%CI: 3.63-3.87), 3.16 (95%CI: 2.90-3.43), and 3.91 (95%CI: 3.71-4.11) by three methods, respectively. Conclusions: The Gamma distribution fits both the generation interval and incubation period best, and the mean value of generation interval is 1.02 day longer than that of incubation period. The relatively high basic reproduction number indicates that the epidemic is still serious; Based on our analysis, the turning point of the epidemic would be seen on 26 January, the growth rate would be lower afterwards.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Basic reproduction number; Generation interval; Incubation period; Novel coronavirus\n\n PMID: \t32113196 \tDOI: \t10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200205-00069",

Methods: Based on the epidemic data of COVID-19 openly accessed from national health authorities, we estimated the dynamic basic reproduction number R(0)(t) to evaluate the effects of the current COVID-19 prevention and control strategies in all the provinces (municipalities and autonomous regions) as well as in Wuhan and the changes in infectivity of COVID-19 over time. Results: For the stability of the results, 24 provinces (municipality) with more than 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases were included in the analysis. At the beginning of the outbreak, the R(0)(t) showed unstable trend with big variances. As the strengthening of the prevention and control strategies, R(0)(t) began to show a downward trend in late January, and became stable in February. By the time of data analysis, 18 provinces (municipality) (75%) had the R(0)(t)s less than 1. The results could be used for the decision making to free population floating conditionally. Conclusions: Dynamic R(0)(t) is useful in the evaluation of the change in infectivity of COVID-19, the prevention and control strategies for the COVID-19 outbreak have shown preliminary effects, if continues, it is expected to control the COVID-19 outbreak in China in near future.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Coronavirus disease; Dynamic bosic reproduction number; Statistical prediction\n\n PMID: \t32113197 \tDOI: \t10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200209-00080",

Methods: Based on SEIR dynamic model, considering the COVID-19 transmission mechanism, infection spectrum and prevention and control procedures, we developed SEIR(+ CAQ) dynamic model to fit the frequencies of laboratory confirmed cases obtained from the government official websites. The data from January 20, 2020 to February 7, 2020 were used to fit the model, while the left data between February 8-12 were used to evaluate the quality of forecasting. Results: According to the cumulative number of confirmed cases between January 29 to February 7, the fitting bias of SEIR(+ CAQ) model for overall China (except for cases of Hubei province), Hubei province (except for cases of Wuhan city) and Wuhan city was less than 5%. For the data of subsequent 5 days between February 8 to 12, which were not included in the model fitting, the prediction biases were less than 10%. Regardless of the cases diagnosed by clinical examines, the numbers of daily emerging cases of China (Hubei province not included), Hubei Province (Wuhan city not included) and Wuhan city reached the peak in the early February. Under the current strength of prevention and control, the total number of laboratory- confirmed cases in overall China will reach 80 417 till February 29, 2020, respectively.

Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

[Epub ahead of print]  In silico screening of Chinese herbal medicines with the potential to directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus.Zhang DH1, Wu KL2, Zhang X3, Deng SQ4, Peng B3.\nAuthor informationAbstract OBJECTIVE:  In this study we execute a rational screen to identify Chinese medical herbs that are commonly used in treating viral respiratory infections and also contain compounds that might directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), an ongoing novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia.\nMETHODS:  There were two main steps in the screening process. In the first step we conducted a literature search for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Resulting compounds were cross-checked for listing in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database. Compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective. Next, a docking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-nCoV protein interaction. In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify plants containing the selected compounds. Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage. Finally, network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the general in vivo effects of each selected herb.\nRESULTS:  Of the natural compounds screened, 13 that exist in traditional Chinese medicines were also found to have potential anti-2019-nCoV activity. Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to contain 2 or more of these 13 compounds. Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically catalogued as treating viral respiratory infections. Network pharmacology analysis predicted that the general in vivo roles of these 26 herbal plants were related to regulating viral infection, immune/inflammation reactions and hypoxia response.\nCONCLUSION:  Chinese herbal treatments classically used for treating viral respiratory infection might contain direct anti-2019-nCoV compounds.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Shanghai Changhai Hospital.

We compared the positive ratio of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid amplification test from different samples including oropharyngeal swab, blood, urine and stool with 3different Fluorescent RT-PCR kits. Nine out of the 19 patients were detected 2019-nCoV infection using oropharyngeal swab samples, and the virus nucleic acid was also detected in eight of these nine patients using stool samples. None of positive results was identified in the blood and urine samples. Thses three different kits got the same result for each sample and the positive ratio of nucleic acid detection for 2019-nCoV was only 47.4% in the suspect patients. Therefore, it is possible that the really infected patients have been missed by using nucleic acid detection only.

There were various degrees of fibrin deposition inside and around the villi with local syncytial nodule increases in all three placentas. One case of placenta showed the concomitant morphology of chorionic hemangioma and another one with massive placental infarction. No pathological change of villitis and chorioamnionitis was observed in our observation of three cases. All samples from three placentas were negative for the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of pregnant women with 2019-nCoV infection in late pregnancy are similar to those of non-pregnant patients, and no severe adverse pregnancy outcome is found in the 3 cases of our observation. Pathological study suggests that there are no morphological changes related to infection in the three placentas. Currently no evidence for intrauterine vertical transmission of 2019-nCoV is found in the three women infected by 2019-nCoV in their late pregnancy.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  2019-nCoV; Clinical characteristic; Pneumonia; placental pathology; prgnant women; vertical transmission\n\n PMID: \t32114744 \tDOI: \t10.3760/cma.j.cn112151-20200225-00138",

Therapeutic strategies in an outbreak scenario to treat the novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China.Kruse RL1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential respiratory viral pandemic to the world population. Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain, providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken. Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).\n  Copyright: \u00a9 2020 Kruse RL.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  2019-nCoV; ACE2; Wuhan; coronavirus; neutralizing antibody; outbreak\n\n PMID: \t32117569 \tPMCID: \tPMC7029759 \tDOI: \t10.12688/f1000research.22211.1 \n  Free full text",

Methods: A retrospective analysis of the epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory examinations, chest imaging, treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019-nCoV was conducted. The patients were diagnosed between January 25th, 2020 and February 21st, 2020 in 21 hospitals in 17 cities of six provinces(autonomous region) of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Hebei, Henan and Shandong. Results: The age of the 31 children with 2019-nCoV infection was 7 years and 1 month (6 months -17 years). Nine cases (29%) were imported cases. Other 21 cases (68%) had contact with confirmed infected adults. One case (3%) had contact with asymptomatic returnees from Wuhan. Among the 31 children, 28 patients (90%) were family cluster cases. The clinical types were asymptomatic type in 4 cases (13%), mild type in 13 cases (42%), and common type in 14 cases (45%). No severe or critical type existed. The most common symptom was fever (n=20, 65%), including 1 case of high fever, 9 cases of moderate fever, 10 cases of low fever. Fever lasted from 1 day to 9 days. The fever of fifteen cases lasted for \u22643 d, while in other 5 cases lasted > 3 d. Other symptoms included cough (n=14, 45%), fatigue (n=3, 10%) and diarrhea (n=3, 9%). Pharyngalgia, runny nose, dizziness, headache and vomiting were rare. In the early stage, the total leukocytes count in peripheral blood decreased in 2 cases (6%), the lymphocytes count decreased in 2 cases (6%), and the platelet count increased in 2 cases (6%).Elevation of C-reactive protein (10%, 3/30), erythrocyte sedimentation rate(19%,4/21), procalcitonin(4%,1/28), liver enzyme(22%, 6/27) and muscle enzyme (15%, 4/27) occurred in different proportions. Renal function and blood glucose were normal. There were abnormal chest CT changes in 14 cases, including 9 cases with patchy ground glass opacities and nodules, mostly located in the lower lobe of both lungs near the pleural area. After receiving supportive treatment, the viral nucleic acid turned negative in 25 cases within 7-23 days. Among them, 24 children (77%) recovered and were discharged from hospital. No death occurred. Conclusions: In this case series, 2019-nCoV infections in children from six provinces (autonomous region) in northern China are mainly caused by close family contact. Clinical types are asymptomatic, mild and common types. Clinical manifestations and laboratory examination results are nonspecific. Close contact history of epidemiology, nucleic acid detection and chest imaging are important bases for diagnosis. After general treatment, the short-term prognosis is good.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  2019 novel coronavirus; Child; Disease attributes\n\n PMID: \t32118389 \tDOI: \t10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20200225-00138",

This might be due to the biological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, and might also be related to the basic disease, clinical status, glucocorticoid using, sample sampling, processing and detecting of patients, and some even related to the re-infection or secondary bacterial virus infection. Therefore, we suggest that in view of this phenomenon, further stratified management of discharge from hospital should be carried out on the basis of guidelines, especially for patients with advanced age, underlying diseases or severe or critical pneumonia. For those patients who can't completely deoxygenate for a long time after hospitalization, individualized treatment methods and different discharge evaluation criteria should be adopted to ensure the complete cure of patients and prevent recurrencing after discharge from hospital.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  COVID-19; Cause analysis; Discharge from hospital; Recurrence; Treatment strategies\n\n PMID: \t32118391 \tDOI: \t10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200229-00219",

The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear. This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence.\nMETHODS:  The clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients' oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed. Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs. The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed.\nRESULTS:  In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0-62.0) years were analyzed. After in-hospital treatment, patients' inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition. The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0-11.0) days. By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients' stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0-16.0) days after symptom onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0-4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients' urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression model (F\u200a=\u200a2.669, P\u200a=\u200a0.044, and adjusted R\u200a=\u200a0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients' stools (t\u200a=\u200a-2.699, P\u200a=\u200a0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, respectively; t\u200a=\u200a2.550, P\u200a=\u200a0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; t\u200a=\u200a4.631, P\u200a<\u200a0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P\u200a>\u200a0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS:  In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease. The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.\n\n\n PMID: \t32118639 \tDOI: \t10.1097/CM9.0000000000000774",

[Epub ahead of print]  Analysis of factors associated with disease outcomes in hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease.Liu W1, Tao ZW2, Lei W1, Ming-Li Y1, Kui L3, Ling Z3, Shuang W3, Yan D3, Jing L4, Liu HG3, Ming Y5, Yi H1.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  Since early December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. This study aims to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia.\nMETHODS:  Patients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression.\nRESULTS:  Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had improved/stabilized. The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group (66 [51, 70] vs. 37 [32, 41] years, U\u200a=\u200a4.932, P\u200a=\u200a0.001). The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilization group (27.3% vs. 3.0%, \u03c7\u200a=\u200a9.291, P\u200a=\u200a0.018). For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]\u00b0C, U\u200a=\u200a2.057, P\u200a=\u200a0.027). Moreover, the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (54.5% vs. 20.9%, \u03c7\u200a=\u200a5.611, P\u200a=\u200a0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] vs. 24 [16, 60] breaths/min, U\u200a=\u200a4.030, P\u200a=\u200a0.004) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] vs. 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, U\u200a=\u200a1.315, P\u200a=\u200a0.024). Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (36.62\u200a\u00b1\u200a6.60 vs. 41.27\u200a\u00b1\u200a4.55\u200ag/L, U\u200a=\u200a2.843, P\u200a=\u200a0.006). Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive high-level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group (\u03c7\u200a=\u200a16.01, P\u200a=\u200a0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds ratio [OR], 8.546; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.628-44.864; P\u200a=\u200a0.011), history of smoking (OR, 14.285; 95% CI: 1.577-25.000; P\u200a=\u200a0.018), maximum body temperature at admission (OR, 8.999; 95% CI: 1.036-78.147, P\u200a=\u200a0.046), respiratory failure (OR, 8.772, 95% CI: 1.942-40.000; P\u200a=\u200a0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95% CI: 1.098-50.000; P\u200a=\u200a0.003), and C-reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95% CI: 1.224-34.701, P\u200a=\u200a0.028) were risk factors for disease progression.\nCONCLUSIONS:  Several factors that led to the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia were identified, including age, history of smoking, maximum body temperature on admission, respiratory failure, albumin, C-reactive protein. These results can be used to further enhance the ability of management of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n\n PMID: \t32118640 \tDOI: \t10.1097/CM9.0000000000000775",

[Epub ahead of print]  Distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic and correlation with population emigration from wuhan, China.Chen ZL1, Zhang Q2, Lu Y3, Guo ZM4, Zhang X1, Zhang WJ5, Guo C6, Liao CH1, Li QL1, Han XH2, Lu JH1.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  The ongoing new coronavirus pneumonia (Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID-19) outbreak is spreading in China, but it has not yet reached its peak. Five million people emigrated from Wuhan before lockdown, potentially representing a source of virus infection. Determining case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in the early stage of the epidemic is of great importance for early warning and for the prevention of future outbreaks.\nMETHODS:  The official case report on the COVID-19 epidemic was collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information on COVID-19 cases was extracted and analyzed using ArcGIS and WinBUGS software. Data on population migration from Wuhan city and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi, and their correlation with the number of cases was analyzed.\nRESULTS:  The COVID-19 confirmed and death cases in Hubei province accounted for 59.91% (5806/9692) and 95.77% (204/213) of the total cases in China respectively. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan, which are adjacent to Hubei. The time risk of Hubei province on the following day was 1.960 times that on the previous day. The number of cases in some cities was relatively low, but the time risk appeared to be continuously rising. The correlation coefficient between the provincial number of cases and emigration from Wuhan was up to 0.943. The lockdown of 17 cities in Hubei province and the implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented an exponential growth in the number of cases.\nCONCLUSIONS:  The population that emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source in other cities and provinces. Some cities with a low number of cases showed a rapid increase in case load. Owing to the upcoming Spring Festival return wave, understanding the risk trends in different regions is crucial to ensure preparedness at both the individual and organization levels and to prevent new outbreaks.\n\n\n PMID: \t32118644 \tDOI: \t10.1097/CM9.0000000000000782",

[Epub ahead of print]  Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts.Hellewell J1, Abbott S1, Gimma A1, Bosse NI1, Jarvis CI1, Russell TW1, Munday JD1, Kucharski AJ1, Edmunds WJ1; Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 Working Group, Funk S1, Eggo RM2.\nCollaborators (11)Author informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  Isolation of cases and contact tracing is used to control outbreaks of infectious diseases, and has been used for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19.\nMETHODS:  We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R0), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort.\nFINDINGS:  Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R0 of 1\u00b75, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R0 was 2\u00b75 or 3\u00b75 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1\u00b75 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R0 of 2\u00b75 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3\u00b75 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1\u00b75. For R0 values of 2\u00b75 or 3\u00b75, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.\nINTERPRETATION:  In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.\nFUNDING:  Wellcome Trust, Global Challenges Research Fund, and Health Data Research UK.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

This was in addition to the National Immunisation Program (NIP) funded QIV for Indigenous children and children with comorbid medical conditions. We assessed the impact of this policy change on influenza disease burden and vaccine coverage, as well as report on 2018 vaccine effectiveness in a hospital-based surveillance system.\nMETHODS:  Subjects were recruited prospectively from twelve PAEDS-FluCAN sentinel hospital sites (April until October 2018). Children aged \u226416 years hospitalised with an acute respiratory illness (ARI) and laboratory-confirmed influenza were considered cases. Hospitalised children with ARI who tested negative for influenza were considered controls. VE estimates were calculated from the adjusted odds ratio of vaccination in cases and controls.\nRESULTS:  A total of 458 children were hospitalised with influenza: 31.7% were <2 years, 5.0% were Indigenous, and 40.6% had medical comorbidities predisposing to severe influenza. Influenza A was detected in 90.6% of children (A/H1N1: 38.0%; A/H3N2: 3.1%; A/unsubtyped 48.6%). The median length of stay was 2 days (IQR: 1,3) and 8.1% were admitted to ICU. Oseltamivir use was infrequent (16.6%). Two in-hospital deaths occurred (0.45%). 12.0% of influenza cases were vaccinated compared with 36.0% of test-negative controls. Vaccine effectiveness of QIV for preventing influenza hospitalisation was estimated at 78.8% (95%CI: 66.9; 86.4).\nCONCLUSIONS:  Compared with 2017 (n = 1268 cases), a significant reduction in severe influenza was observed in Australian children, possibly contributed to by improved vaccine coverage and high vaccine effectiveness. Despite introduction of jurisdictionally-funded preschool programs and NIP-funded vaccine for children with risk factors for severe disease, improved coverage is required to ensure adequate protection against paediatric influenza morbidity and mortality.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Improving Influenza Vaccination in Hospitalized Children With Asthma.Foradori DM1, Sampayo EM2, Fanny SA2, Namireddy MK2, Kumar AM2, Lo HY2.\nAuthor informationAbstract OBJECTIVES:  Children with asthma are at increased risk of complications from influenza; hospitalization represents an important opportunity for vaccination. We aimed to increase the influenza vaccination rate among eligible hospitalized patients with asthma on the pediatric hospital medicine (PHM) service from 13% to 80% over a 4-year period.\nMETHODS:  Serial Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles were implemented to improve influenza vaccination rates among children admitted with status asthmaticus and included modifications to the electronic health record (EHR) and provider and family education. Success of the initial PHM pilot led to the development of a hospital-wide vaccination tracking tool and an institutional, nurse-driven vaccine protocol by a multidisciplinary team. Our primary outcome metric was the inpatient influenza vaccination rate among PHM patients admitted with status asthmaticus. Process measures included documentation of influenza vaccination status and use of the EHR asthma order set and a history and physical template. The balance measure was adverse vaccine reaction within 24 hours. Data analysis was performed by using statistical process control charts.\nRESULTS:  The inpatient influenza vaccination rate increased from 13% to 57% over 4 years; special cause variation was achieved. Overall, 50% of eligible patients were vaccinated during asthma hospitalization in the postintervention period. Documentation of influenza vaccination status significantly increased from 51% to 96%, and asthma history and physical and order set use also improved. No adverse vaccine reactions were documented.\nCONCLUSIONS:  A bundle of interventions, including EHR modifications, provider and family education, hospital-wide tracking, and a nurse-driven vaccine protocol, increased influenza vaccination rates among eligible children hospitalized with status asthmaticus.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\n\n PMID: \t32107285 \tDOI: \t10.1542/peds.2019-1735",

Impact of corticosteroid treatment on clinical outcomes of influenza-associated ARDS: a nationwide multicenter study.Tsai MJ1,2,3,4, Yang KY5,6, Chan MC7,8,9, Kao KC10,11, Wang HC12, Perng WC13, Wu CL7,14, Liang SJ15, Fang WF16,17, Tsai JR1,2,4, Chang WA1,2,3, Chien YC12, Chen WC5,18, Hu HC10,11, Lin CY16, Chao WC7,19, Sheu CC20,21,22,23; for Taiwan Severe Influenza Research Consortium (TSIRC) Investigators.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  Corticosteroid treatment has been widely used in the treatment of septic shock, influenza, and ARDS, although some previous studies discourage its use in severe influenza patients. This multicenter retrospective cohort study conducted in the intensive care units (ICUs) of eight medical centers across Taiwan aims to determine the real-world status of corticosteroid treatment in patients with influenza-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and its impact on clinical outcomes. Between October 2015 and March 2016, consecutive ICU patients with virology-proven influenza infections who fulfilled ARDS and received invasive mechanical ventilation were enrolled. The impact of early corticosteroid treatment (\u2265\u2009200 mg hydrocortisone equivalent dose within 3 days after ICU admission, determined by a sensitivity analysis) on hospital mortality (the primary outcome) was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis, and further confirmed in a propensity score-matched cohort.\nRESULTS:  Among the 241 patients with influenza-associated ARDS, 85 (35.3%) patients receiving early corticosteroid treatment had similar baseline characteristics, but a significantly higher hospital mortality rate than those without early corticosteroid treatment [43.5% (37/85) vs. 19.2% (30/156), p\u2009<\u20090.001]. Early corticosteroid treatment was independently associated with increased hospital mortality in overall patients [adjusted odds ratio (95% CI)\u2009=\u20095.02 (2.39-10.54), p\u2009<\u20090.001] and in all subgroups. Earlier treatment and higher dosing were associated with higher hospital mortality. Early corticosteroid treatment was associated with a significantly increased odds of subsequent bacteremia [adjusted odds ratio (95% CI)\u2009=\u20092.37 (1.01-5.56)]. The analyses using a propensity score-matched cohort showed consistent results.\nCONCLUSIONS:  Early corticosteroid treatment was associated with a significantly increased hospital mortality in adult patients with influenza-associated ARDS. Earlier treatment and higher dosing were associated with higher hospital mortality. Clinicians should be cautious while using corticosteroid treatment in this patient group.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Glucocorticoid; Influenza; Mortality; Pneumonia; Steroid\n\n PMID: \t32107651 \tDOI: \t10.1186/s13613-020-0642-4",

Given that humans have frequent contact with dogs, this has prompted an increased emphasis on biosafety. In this study, we collected 693 nasal swab samples and 800 blood samples from stray dogs in animal shelters to survey canine influenza epidemiology and characterize the evolution of CIV H3N2 in Shanghai. We tested samples for canine influenza antibodies and canine influenza RNA in January-May, 2019, and the results showed that the positive rate was 17.62% by ELISA, 15.75% by microneutralization (MN) assay, and 18.51% by real time RT-PCR, respectively. We also performed phylogenetic and genomic analysis on six H3N2 CIV isolates. The H3N2 viruses which prevailed in Shanghai originated from Beijing and Jiangsu isolates. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequences of CIV isolates have multiple amino acid antigenic drifts, deletions, and substitutions. The time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of HA and NA was 2004 and 2005, respectively. Notably, the substitution, 146S, in hemagglutinin and the deletion in the neuraminidase (NA) stalk region we found in this study warrant attention because they have frequently been identified in human influenza viruses. The potential adaptation of this CIV H3N2 clade to mammals and its public health threat should be further evaluated.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  CIV; Epidemiology; Evolution; Genomic analysis; Phylogeny\n\n PMID: \t32107672 \tDOI: \t10.1007/s11262-020-01748-2",

We estimated VE for preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization among US children.\nMETHODS:  We included children aged 6 months-17 years with acute respiratory illness enrolled in the New Vaccine Surveillance Network during the 2015-2016 influenza season. Documented influenza vaccination status was obtained from state immunization information systems, the electronic medical record, and/or provider records. Midturbinate nasal and throat swabs were tested for influenza using molecular assays. We estimated VE as 100% \u00d7 (1 - odds ratio), comparing the odds of vaccination among subjects testing influenza positive with subjects testing negative, using multivariable logistic regression.\nRESULTS:  Of 1653 participants, 36 of 707 (5%) of those fully vaccinated, 18 of 226 (8%) of those partially vaccinated, and 85 of 720 (12%) of unvaccinated children tested positive for influenza. Of those vaccinated, almost 90% were documented to have received inactivated vaccine. The majority (81%) of influenza cases were in children \u2264\u20098 years of age. Of the 139 influenza-positive cases, 42% were A(H1N1)pdm09, 42% were B viruses, and 14% were A(H3N2).

The most predominant pathogen was MP (45.6%), followed by Parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) (22.6%) and influenza B viruses (IFVB) (14.7%). Coinfection was observed in 2,907 specimens (27.9%); the coinfection combination containing MP and PIVs had the highest detection rate of 15%, followed by MP and IFVB as well as IFVB and PIVs.\nCONCLUSIONS:  MP was the most commonly detected bacteria among hospitalized children, which should be included in the differential diagnosis for hospitalized children with RTI.

Compared to other age groups, children and elderly adults have the highest risk of developing influenza-related complications and requiring hospitalization. During the last years, \"test negative design\" (TND) studies have been implemented in order to estimate influenza VE. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize the findings of TND studies reporting influenza VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalization in children aged 6 months to 17 years. We searched the PubMed and Embase databases and identified 2615 non-duplicate studies that required detailed review. Among them, 28 met our inclusion criteria and we performed a random-effects meta-analysis using adjusted VE estimates. In our primary analysis, influenza vaccine offered significant protection against any type influenza-related hospitalization (57.48%; 95% CI 49.46-65.49). When we examined influenza VE per type and strain, VE was higher against H1N1 (74.07%; 95% CI: 54.85-93.30) and influenza B (50.87%; 95% CI: 41.75-59.98), and moderate against H3N2 (40.77%; 95% CI: 25.65-55.89). Notably, influenza vaccination offered higher protection in children who were fully vaccinated (61.79%; 95% CI: 54.45-69.13), compared to those who were partially vaccinated (33.91%; 95% CI: 21.12 - 46.69). Also, influenza VE was high in children less than 5 years old (61.71%; 95% CI: 49.29-74.12) as well as in children 6-17 years old (54.37%; 95% CI: 35.14-73.60). In conclusion, in the pediatric population, influenza vaccination offered significant protection against influenza-related hospitalization and complete annual vaccination should be encouraged.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

There is a need for more effective treatments for severe and hospitalized cases of influenza. In this study, we have tested the efficacy of a human plasma-derived IgG product (FLU-IGIV) against seasonal influenza in mouse and ferret models of influenza infection. FLU-IGIV successfully protected mice (100% survival) against lethal influenza infection. Also, the survival rate observed with FLU-IGIV treatment was better than the survival rate observed with oseltamivir (60% survival). FLU-IGIV significantly reduced the viral load in the lungs compared to placebo (PBS) in ferrets infected with influenza A/California/July 2009 (H1N1pdm09) virus.

[Epub ahead of print]  Cost-effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccination in children with medical risk conditions in the Netherlands.Naber SK1, Bruijning-Verhagen PCJL2, de Hoog MLA3, van Giessen A4.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  In many countries, annual immunization with inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) is recommended for children with medical risk conditions. Prior cost-effectiveness analyses found such immunization to be cost saving, but assumed effectiveness against non-severe influenza outcomes and a higher effectiveness against severe influenza outcomes than recent studies would suggest. However, recent vaccine studies do not indicate any reduction in community or outpatient disease episodes in IIV immunized individuals. We therefore evaluated cost-effectiveness of IIV immunization in children with medical risk conditions in the Netherlands, assuming that IIV reduces influenza-related hospitalization and death, but has no meaningful impact on non-severe health outcomes.\nMETHODS:  A health economic decision tree model was developed to evaluate health effects and costs of annual IIV immunization versus no immunization. Model inputs were based on our study on influenza-related primary care visits and other literature. Immunization was considered cost effective if associated costs were less than \u20ac20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess robustness of results, and one-way sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were done to assess the influence of individual parameters.\nRESULTS:  Annual IIV prevents an average of 1.59 influenza-related hospitalizations and 0.02 deaths per 1,000 children with medical risk conditions. This results in an expected QALY gain of 0.43 at incremental costs of \u20ac21,564 per 1,000 children, corresponding to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of \u20ac50,297/QALY compared to no immunization. Under base case assumptions, immunization had a 5% probability of being cost effective. Results were most influenced by vaccine efficacy against fatal influenza, QALY loss due to death, and mortality rate.\nCONCLUSIONS:  If IIV only reduces severe disease outcomes, as current evidence suggests, annual immunization of medical risk children is unlikely to be cost effective. Results should however be interpreted with caution as cost-effectiveness is largely dependent on incidence and QALY losses for fatal influenza, for which evidence is scarce.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

Broadly Protective Strategies Against Influenza Viruses: Universal Vaccines and Therapeutics.Vogel OA1, Manicassamy B2.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Influenza virus is a respiratory pathogen that can cause disease in humans, with symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening. The vast majority of influenza virus infections in humans are observed during seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. Given the substantial public health burden associated with influenza virus infection, yearly vaccination is recommended for protection against seasonal influenza viruses. Despite vigilant surveillance for new variants and careful selection of seasonal vaccine strains, the efficacy of seasonal vaccines can vary widely from year to year. This often results in lowered protection within the population, regardless of vaccination status. In order to broaden the protection afforded by seasonal influenza vaccines, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has deemed the development of a universal influenza virus vaccine to be a priority in influenza virus vaccine research. This universal vaccine would provide protection against all influenza virus strains, eliminating the need for the yearly reformulations of seasonal influenza vaccines. In addition to universal influenza vaccine efforts, substantial progress has been made in developing novel influenza virus therapeutics that utilize broadly neutralizing antibodies to provide protection against influenza virus infection and to mitigate disease outcomes during infection. In this review, we discuss various approaches toward the goal of improving influenza virus vaccine efficacy through a universal influenza virus vaccine. We also address the novel methods of discovery and utilization of broadly neutralizing antibodies to improve influenza disease outcomes.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Vogel and Manicassamy.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  immunization; influenza; influenza therapeutics; universal influenza vaccine; vaccine\n\n PMID: \t32117155 \tPMCID: \tPMC7020694 \tDOI: \t10.3389/fmicb.2020.00135 \n  Free full text",

Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that B51 is a novel reassortant influenza virus containing segments from human H7N4 virus and North American wild bird influenza viruses. This suggest that B51 has undergone multiple reassortment events.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Li, Sun, Lv, Wang, Li, Li, Liu, Zhi, Yang, Fu, Ma, Li, Zhou, Li, Yang, Chen, Zhang, Zheng, Zhang, Hua, Yang, Li, Richt and Chai.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  H9N2 subtype; influenza in birds; phylogeny; public health; reassortant viruses\n\n PMID: \t32117193 \tPMCID: \tPMC7031422 \tDOI: \t10.3389/fmicb.2020.00220 \n  Free full text",

Respiratory Barrier as a Safeguard and Regulator of Defense Against Influenza A Virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae.LeMessurier KS1,2,3, Tiwary M1,2,3, Morin NP1,4, Samarasinghe AE1,2,3.\nAuthor informationAbstract   The primary function of the respiratory system of gas exchange renders it vulnerable to environmental pathogens that circulate in the air. Physical and cellular barriers of the respiratory tract mucosal surface utilize a variety of strategies to obstruct microbe entry. Physical barrier defenses including the surface fluid replete with antimicrobials, neutralizing immunoglobulins, mucus, and the epithelial cell layer with rapidly beating cilia form a near impenetrable wall that separates the external environment from the internal soft tissue of the host. Resident leukocytes, primarily of the innate immune branch, also maintain airway integrity by constant surveillance and the maintenance of homeostasis through the release of cytokines and growth factors. Unfortunately, pathogens such as influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae require hosts for their replication and dissemination, and prey on the respiratory tract as an ideal environment causing severe damage to the host during their invasion. In this review, we outline the host-pathogen interactions during influenza and post-influenza bacterial pneumonia with a focus on inter- and intra-cellular crosstalk important in pulmonary immune responses.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 LeMessurier, Tiwary, Morin and Samarasinghe.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  barrier defense; co-infection; epithelial cells; lung mucosa; respiratory tract\n\n PMID: \t32117216 \tPMCID: \tPMC7011736 \tDOI: \t10.3389/fimmu.2020.00003 \n  Free full text",

Inflammation as a Modulator of Host Susceptibility to Pulmonary Influenza, Pneumococcal, and Co-Infections.Aguilera ER1, Lenz LL1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Bacterial and viral pathogens are predominant causes of pulmonary infections and complications. Morbidity and mortality from these infections is increased in populations that include the elderly, infants, and individuals with genetic disorders such as Down syndrome. Immune senescence, concurrent infections, and other immune alterations occur in these susceptible populations, but the underlying mechanisms that dictate increased susceptibility to lung infections are not fully defined. Here, we review unique features of the lung as a mucosal epithelial tissue and aspects of inflammatory and immune responses in model pulmonary infections and co-infections by influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In these models, lung inflammatory responses are a double-edged sword: recruitment of immune effectors is essential to eliminate bacteria and virus-infected cells, but inflammatory cytokines drive changes in the lung conducive to increased pathogen replication. Excessive accumulation of inflammatory cells also hinders lung function, possibly causing death of the host. Some animal studies have found that targeting host modulators of lung inflammatory responses has therapeutic or prophylactic effects in these infection and co-infection models. However, conflicting results from other studies suggest microbiota, sequence of colonization, or other unappreciated aspects of lung biology also play important roles in the outcome of infections. Regardless, a predisposition to excessive or aberrant inflammatory responses occurs in susceptible human populations. Hence, in appropriate contexts, modulation of inflammatory responses may prove effective for reducing the frequency or severity of pulmonary infections. However, there remain limitations in our understanding of how this might best be achieved-particularly in diverse human populations.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Aguilera and Lenz.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  bacterial infection; down syndrome; innate immunity; pulmonary inflammation; viral infection\n\n PMID: \t32117259 \tPMCID: \tPMC7026256 \tDOI: \t10.3389/fimmu.2020.00105 \n  Free full text",

Natural Killer Cells Dampen the Pathogenic Features of Recall Responses to Influenza Infection.Mooney JP1,2, Qendro T1, Keith M2, Philbey AW3, Groves HT4, Tregoning JS4, Goodier MR1, Riley EM1,2.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Despite evidence of augmented Natural Killer (NK) cell responses after influenza vaccination, the role of these cells in vaccine-induced immunity remains unclear. Here, we hypothesized that NK cells might increase viral clearance but possibly at the expense of increased severity of pathology. On the contrary, we found that NK cells serve a homeostatic role during influenza virus infection of vaccinated mice, allowing viral clearance with minimal pathology. Using a diphtheria toxin receptor transgenic mouse model, we were able to specifically deplete NKp46+ NK cells through the administration of diphtheria toxin. Using this model, we assessed the effect of NK cell depletion prior to influenza challenge in vaccinated and unvaccinated mice. NK-depleted, vaccinated animals lost significantly more weight after viral challenge than vaccinated NK intact animals, indicating that NK cells ameliorate disease in vaccinated animals. However, there was also a significant reduction in viral load in NK-depleted, unvaccinated animals indicating that NK cells also constrain viral clearance. Depletion of NK cells after vaccination, but 21 days before infection, did not affect viral clearance or weight loss-indicating that it is the presence of NK cells during the infection itself that promotes homeostasis. Further work is needed to identify the mechanism(s) by which NK cells regulate adaptive immunity in influenza-vaccinated animals to allow efficient and effective virus control whilst simultaneously minimizing inflammation and pathology.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Mooney, Qendro, Keith, Philbey, Groves, Tregoning, Goodier and Riley.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  NK cell; diphtheria toxin; influenza; lung; mice; vaccine\n\n PMID: \t32117282 \tPMCID: \tPMC7019041 \tDOI: \t10.3389/fimmu.2020.00135 \n  Free full text",

The primary objective was to estimate the incidence rates of adverse events occurring within seven days of vaccination with Fluarix Tetra. In nine General Practices, seasonal influenza vaccine was administered to patients according to local guidelines. Events following immunization were collected using customized cards (enhanced component) combined with electronic health records [EHRs] (EHR component) to estimate incidence rates of adverse events experienced post vaccination. The study ran from 01-Sep-2017 to 30-Nov-2017. A total of 23,939 subjects were vaccinated of whom 16,433 received Fluarix Tetra. The cumulative incidence rates of adverse events of interest for Fluarix Tetra were 7.25% [95% CI, 5.95-8.73] for events reported by card alone, and 9.21% [95% CI, 7.37-11.34] when combined with EHR data.

All types of vaccines must be tested for potency before use; thus, quantitative potency assays are needed for influenza vaccines. The single radial immunodiffusion (SRID) assay is considered the gold standard for quantification of influenza virus antigens, and the SRID reference reagents are essential for the determination of vaccine potency. However, it remains debatable whether reference reagents derived from egg-based vaccine platforms can be used to precisely quantify non-egg-derived vaccines; thus, influenza vaccine production using cell-based platforms has attracted increasing attention. To evaluate the utility of reference reagents derived from a cell-based influenza vaccine platform, we prepared cell-based reference reagents from MDCK cell-grown viruses and compared them with egg-derived reference reagents. A primary liquid standard (PLS) was purified from cell-derived candidate influenza vaccine viruses, and hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content was determined by a densitometric method. The produced PLS could be stored at 4\u00b0C for more than 10 months. We also established a simple HA protein purification method for goat antiserum preparation, and the performance of the resulting antiserum was compared to that of standard reagents obtained using different production platforms. The results of this study indicate that these reference reagents can be used for both cell-based and egg-based production platforms and that the differences between these two types of platforms are negligible.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  H7N9 influenza virus; Standard reagents; hemagglutinin; quantification; validation\n\n PMID: \t32118516 \tDOI: \t10.1080/21645515.2020.1721223",

The aim was to assess if hyperferritinemia (ferritin \u2265500 ng/mL) could be a marker of poor prognosis in hospitalized patients with confirmed influenza A infection.\nMETHODS:  We prospectively recruited all hospitalized adult patients which tested positive for the influenza A rRT-PCR assay performed on respiratory samples in two consecutive influenza periods (2016-17 and 2017-18). Poor outcome was defined as the presence of at least one of the following: respiratory failure, admission to the Intensive Care Unit or in-hospital mortality.\nRESULTS:  Among 494 patients, 68 (14%) developed poor outcome. One-hundred twelve patients (23%) had hyperferritinemia (39/68; 57% in the poor outcome group vs. 73/426; 17% in the remaining patients, p<0.0001). Median serum ferritin levels were significantly higher in the subgroup of patients with poor outcome (609 ng/ml (range 231-967) vs. 217 ng/ml (range 140-394), p<0.0001). In multivariate analysis, hyperferritinemia was associated with a five-fold increase in the odds ratio of developing poor outcome. After adjusting for classic influenza risk factors, ferritin remained as a significant predictive factor in all exploratory models. Ferritin levels had a good discriminative capacity with an area under the ROC curve of 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65-0.8, p<0.001) and an overall diagnostic accuracy for predicting poor outcome of 79.3% (95% IC 75.4-82.7%).\nCONCLUSIONS:  Serum ferritin may discriminate a subgroup of patients with influenza infection with higher risk of developing poor outcome.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

Accordingly, health authorities in some countries prioritize vaccination of this population. Nevertheless, questions remain about this policy's effectiveness given the potential for bias and confounding in observational data.\nObjective:  To determine the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine in reducing hospitalizations and mortality among elderly persons by using an observational research design that reduces the possibility of bias and confounding.\nDesign:  A regression discontinuity design was applied to the sharp change in vaccination rate at age 65 years that resulted from an age-based vaccination policy in the United Kingdom. In this design, comparisons were limited to individuals who were near the age-65 threshold and were thus plausibly similar along most dimensions except vaccination rate.\nSetting:  England and Wales.\nParticipants:  Adults aged 55 to 75 years residing in the study area during 2000 to 2014.\nIntervention:  Seasonal influenza vaccine.\nMeasurements:  Hospitalization and mortality rates by month of age.\nResults:  The data included 170 million episodes of care and 7.6 million deaths. Turning 65 was associated with a statistically and clinically significant increase in rate of seasonal influenza vaccination. However, no evidence indicated that vaccination reduced hospitalizations or mortality among elderly persons. The estimates were precise enough to rule out results from many previous studies.\nLimitation:  The study relied on observational data, and its focus was limited to individuals near age 65 years.\nConclusion:  Current vaccination strategies prioritizing elderly persons may be less effective than believed at reducing serious morbidity and mortality in this population, which suggests that supplementary strategies may be necessary.\nPrimary Funding Source:  National Institute on Aging.\n\n\n PMID: \t32120383 \tDOI: \t10.7326/M19-3075",

Though work on a novel coronavirus vaccine has been some of the fastest on record, Fauci said, he explained to senators that a vaccine candidate must be proven safe and efficacious in a multi-step trial process. \n  Senators also asked questions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat, MD, about CDC testing, and lawmakers were told several times throughout the hearing that public health labs would see a major increase in testing capacity by the end of the week. \n  Fauci also said the United States was \"pretty close\" to a COVID-19 blood test that could quickly and easily be used in clinics and hospitals. \nBoosting respirator supply  In addition to testing, the officials assured lawmakers that yesterday the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an Emergency Use Authorization that would greatly increase the supply of masks in the country.\n  \"The FDA granted the CDC\u2019s request for an emergency use authorization (EUA) to allow health care personnel to use certain industrial respirators during the COVID-19 outbreak in health care settings,\" the FDA said in a statement yesterday. \"The FDA concluded that respirators approved by NIOSH, but not currently meeting the FDA's requirements, may be effective in preventing health care personnel from airborne exposure, including COVID-19, which can cause serious or life-threatening disease, including severe respiratory illness.\"\n  The EUA does not apply to the public, the FDA warned, and said respirators are most useful in the hands of healthcare workers. \n  At the hearing was Health and Human Services (HHS) Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, Robert Kadlec, MD. HHS announced today that Kadlec will be managing the response across the government's health agencies and will report directly to HHS Secretary Alex Azar, Politico reported.\nCDC confirms 108 cases  Also today, Nancy Messonnier, MD, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in a press briefing, said that, as of last night there were 60 cases of COVID-19 in Americans who contracted the virus while traveling (22 cases), through close case contact (11 cases), or within the community (27 cases).\n  There are also 48 cases in repatriated Americans, who contracted the virus in Wuhan or aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.\n  Today both Georgia and North Carolina reported their first infections. This raises the number of states affected to 14.\n  Messonnier said the CDC will now be updating COVID-19 case counts on its website daily at noon Eastern Time but added that states performing their own tests may confirm cases faster than the CDC. \n  \"There may be a day when we only look for severe illnesses,\" said Messonnier. \"What we are seeing abroad is now what is happening in the United States.\"\n  Messonnier said the communities experiencing infections will offer the best guidance to citizens, which may include social distancing and self-isolation. She said people over the age of 65 and those with underlying health problems will want to think about how to reduce their exposure to the virus.\n  \"The greatest risk of infection is still in healthcare workers and family members who have close contact with case-patients,\" Messonnier said. \nDeath toll in Seattle rises to 9  Today, officials in King County, Washington, confirmed three more deaths attributed to a COVID-19 outbreak at the Life Care long-term care facility in Kirkland, and seven more cases in King County.\n  Two of the deaths (both involving Life Care residents) occurred last week and are now being attributed to the novel coronavirus. All nine US deaths of COVID-19 have occurred in Washington state. \n  \"This is a very fluid, fast-moving situation as we aggressively respond to this outbreak,\" said Jeff Duchin, MD, Seattle & King County public health officer, in a press release. \"People with suspected or confirmed exposure to COVID-19 should reach out to their healthcare provider. As public health professionals we really appreciate clinicians on the front lines of patient care and they are critical to this response.\" \n  Kirkland officials said 27 firefighters and 2 police officers are in quarantine after being exposed to patients. \n  \"We anticipate that this could continue to happen as the situation evolves. We have also been notified that some of our firefighters in quarantine are demonstrating flu like symptoms,\" the city said in a news release. \"We are working closely with Public Health \u2013 Seattle & King County and adhering to their testing protocols.\"\nNorth Carolina, New York, Florida updates  The newly reported patient in North Carolina, the state's first, had recently visited the Life Care nursing home in Washington. News media in North Carolina are reporting the patient is being treated at home, in isolation. \n  New York City officials, meanwhile, reported a second case. The man, in his 50s, lives in Westchester County and works in Manhattan. He had no recent travel history or known case contact, which suggests the virus may be spreading more widely in New York City than previously thought, the New York Times reported. \n  Finally today, Florida officials said the state's third presumptive positive case has been identified in a woman in Hillsborough County. She is the sister of another case-patient who contracted COVID-19 on a recent trip to Italy.",

Of nearly 2,000 cases reported in the rest of the world yesterday, though, 80% were from South Korea, Iran, and Italy.\n  Disruptions in the supply of PPE are severe and increasing because of hoarding, misuse, and increased demand, he said. Surgical mask prices have increased sixfold, N95 respirator prices have tripled, and gown costs have doubled.\n  The WHO has shipped 500,000 sets of PPE to 27 countries, but supplies are rapidly depleting. It estimates that PPE supplies need to increase by 40%, and Tedros again called on manufacturers to rapidly scale up production and urged governments to offer incentives to boost supplies, including easing restrictions on the export and distribution of PPE and other medical supplies.\n  \"This cannot be solved by WHO alone, or one industry alone. It requires all of us working together to ensure all countries can protect the people who protect the rest of us,\" he said.\nIran outbreak poses tough challenges  Iran's health ministry today reported 835 new cases, along with 11 more deaths, lifting its respective totals to 2,336 cases and 77 deaths.\n  At today's WHO briefing, Mike Ryan, MD, who directs the WHO's health emergencies program, said that, of the recent hot spots, health officials are most concerned about Iran, including about the supply of equipment such as ventilators. He said a WHO mission is in its second day there and added that a team from China is on hand to assist.\n  Ryan said the country has a tough challenge, because the virus is well established in many cities. \"It's not impossible to root out, but it is difficult work, and medical supplies are essential.\"\nSouth Korea spike continues  South Korea today reported 600 more cases, plus 2 more deaths, raising its overall total to 4,812 illnesses, 28 of them fatal.\n  In China, the country's National Health Commission (NHC) today reported 125 more cases, 114 of them in Hubei province, and of those, 111 are in Wuhan. China's overall total is now 80,151 cases. The NHC also reported 31 more deaths and 304 fewer serious cases, bringing those respective totals to 2,943 and 6,806.\n  In another development, China yesterday reported 7 cases imported from Italy, all involving people who worked at the same restaurant as a woman who got sick after returning from Italy, Rome's ANSA news agency reported. China's state media has reported that travelers from other COVID-19 hot spots, such as South Korea, Japan, Iran, and Italy, will be quarantined for 14 days in some parts of China, the BBC reported.\n  Meanwhile, Japan's health ministry today reported 16 more cases in eight prefectures, raising its total to 257. However, it lists its overall total as 284, with 27 asymptomatic carriers. And Singapore today reported 2 new cases, 1 of them linked to a workplace cluster, raising its total to 110.\nItaly cases surge; outbreak expands in Europe  Italy today reported 466 new cases, along with 27 more deaths, boosting its total to 2,502 cases, 79 of them fatal. The health ministry's latest report shows that 1,520 of the country's cases are from the hard-hit Lombardy region.\n  Elsewhere in Europe, the United Kingdom\u2014which has 51 cases now\u2014today published its coronavirus response plan, which has a four-tiered approach that starts with the current containment phase. It said the next phase involves delaying the spread to avoid overlap with the flu season and an added burden to the health system.\n  Elsewhere, Spain announced its first COVID-19 death, in a patient from Valencia. The country has at least 145 cases, including 49 in Madrid. And Ukraine reported its first case, which involves a man who had traveled from Italy.\nCommunity transmission in Australia  Australia today reported its first case involving community transmission, in a doctor with no relevant travel history or connection to a confirmed case. Government officials signaled plans to use a rarely used law to enforce quarantine.\n  The US Agency for International Development (USAID) yesterday announced $37 million targeted to 25 affected or high-risk countries. It said the support is the first funds committed from an earlier pledge of up to $100 million.\n  Three more countries reported their first cases: Gibraltar, Chile, and Argentina. All involved travelers from Italy.\n  The WHO's Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) yesterday announced the rollout of an online platform to help with case and contact data for COVID-19 in Latin American countries.",

COVID-19 is a new disease and there is more to learn about how it spreads, the severity of illness it causes, and to what extent it may spread in the United States. Person-to-person spread\n\n\nThe virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).\nThrough respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\n\nThese droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.\n\nSpread from contact with infected surfaces or objects\n\n\nIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\n\nCan someone spread the virus without being sick?People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).\nSome spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\n\nHow easily does the virus spread?\n\n\nHow easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained.\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (\u201ccommunity spread\u201d) in some affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.\n\n\nInternational Areas with Sustained (Ongoing) Transmission\n\n\nLast updated February 28, 2020China (Level 3 Travel Health Notice)\nIran (Level 3 Travel Health Notice)\nItaly (Level 3 Travel Health Notice)\nJapan (Level 2 Travel Health Notice)\nSouth Korea (Level 3 Travel Health Notice)\nRelated LinksAll COVID-19 Travel Health Notices\nCOVID-19 Situation Summary\n\nPage last reviewed: February 28, 2020\nContent source: National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), Division of Viral Diseases\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...nsmission.html",

The MOH listed the case as primary, meaning he is unlikely to have contracted the virus from another person. The patient is not a healthcare worker.\n  Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe illness and death. The virus can transmit between humans but has done so mainly in healthcare settings, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n  As of Jan 31, 2020, the WHO said that it had received reports of 2,519 laboratory-con\ufb01rmed MERS infections, including 866 associated deaths. The vast majority of these cases occurred in Saudi Arabia.\nMar 3 Saudi MOH report\n\nFlu vaccination may not prevent hospitalization or death in seniors  A large observational study of people 55 to 75 years old in England and Wales from 2000 to 2014 found no evidence that flu vaccination reduced hospitalizations or deaths in this age-group, which is at high risk for serious complications of the flu.\n  The National Institute on Aging\u2013funded study, published in today's Annals of Internal Medicine, used data from patient surveys and administrative records from 170 million episodes of care and 7.6 million deaths.\n  The researchers found an overall 0.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.5 to 2.7) change in hospitalization rate for flu and pneumonia per 10,000 persons at age 65 after vaccination, and flu vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization was -5.8% (95% CI, -25.3% to 12.9%) in people 65 and older. Change in death rate due to flu and pneumonia in this group was also 0.6 and likewise not statistically significant (95% CI, -0.2 to 1.4), while vaccine effectiveness against death was -17.3% (95% CI, -40.7% to 6.0%) in seniors.\n  The US-based authors said that flu vaccines may be mildly effective against serious outcomes in older people and that they should continue receiving them, particularly high-dose versions. They add, \"Supplementary strategies, such as vaccinating children and others who are most likely to spread influenza, may also be necessary to address the high burden of influenza-related complications among older patients.\"\n  Previous observational studies with traditional research designs have suggested that flu vaccination reduces hospitalizations and deaths in the older population, leading health authorities in some countries to prioritize their vaccination. The authors point out, however, that the potential for bias and confounding in observational data have led some experts to question that strategy's effectiveness.\n  The authors said their study used a regression discontinuity design to reduce bias and confounding. \"[Our] estimates were precise enough to rule out results from many previous studies,\" they wrote.\nMar 3 Ann Intern Med abstract\n\nWHO says Northern Hemisphere flu still elevated, Europe may have peaked  Flu activity is still elevated in much of the Northern Hemisphere but appears to have peaked in some European countries, according to the WHO's latest global flu update yesterday.\n  In North America, flu activity remains elevated, predominantly with influenza A and B viruses.\n  East Asia reports a decrease in flu activity, while Central Asia also reports elevated flu activity, although it has ebbed in some countries. North Africa continues to experience increased activity of flu strains A and B.\n  The Caribbean, Central America, tropical Africa, and southern Asia report low levels of flu activity, with some exceptions, the WHO said. Southeast Asia continues to report flu activity in some countries.\n  Globally, of flu viruses tested in the first half of February, 62.8% were influenza A and 37.2% were influenza B. Of the subtyped A viruses, 66.5% were 2009 H1N1, and 33.5% were H3N2. Of the characterized B viruses, 99% belonged to the B-Victoria lineage, the report said.\nMar 2 WHO influenza update\nWHO reports 4 new Lassa fever cases and 1 death in Benin  The WHO's African regional office has reported a new Lassa fever outbreak in Benin that has infected four and killed one.  \n  The outbreak, first reported to WHO on Feb 19, is in Borgou department in the northeast. The index patient was a 40-year-old woman in Kwara state in western Nigeria on the border with Benin who visited a local health center for symptomatic treatment of a nonfebrile illness on Feb 11.\n  Her condition deteriorated, causing abdominal pain and bleeding from multiple orifices. When she was transferred to the Borgou Department University Hospital Centre in Benin on Feb 17, she was confused and weak, vomiting blood, and bleeding abnormally from her uterus. She died on Feb 18, and blood specimens confirmed Lassa virus infection.\n  From Feb 18 to 24, three relatives and contacts of the patient were transferred to the same hospital in Benin with a similar illness and tested positive for Lassa fever. They are currently in isolation and receiving care. Thirty-four contacts, including 23 healthcare workers, have been identified in Benin and Nigeria and are being monitored daily, the WHO said.\n  Several Lassa fever outbreaks have occurred since 2014, usually at the peak of outbreaks in Nigeria, where the disease is endemic.\nMar 1 WHO report",

In addition to developing new local clinical practice guidelines for pediatric UTIs that recommended the narrow-spectrum antibiotics cephalexin or sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim as initial therapy, KPCO conducted a 2-hour educational session on the new guidelines, added them to a searchable online repository, and added a pediatric UTI algorithm and order set to the electronic health record.\n  To determine the impact of the intervention on prescribing for pediatric UTIs, KPCO researchers conducted an interrupted time-series analysis to compare prescribing before and after the implementation date (January 2014 to September 2018).\n  Among the 2,142 outpatient UTIs identified (1,636 pre-intervention and 506 post-intervention), after adjusting for clustering of UTIs within treating clinicians, the analysis found that the proportion of UTIs treated with first-line antibiotics increased from 43.4% pre-intervention to 62.4% post-intervention (P < .0001). Use of cephalexin increased from 28.9% to 53% (P < .0001), while use of the second-line antibiotic cefexime decreased from 17.3% to 2.6% (P < .0001). The changes were sustained for 1 year after the intervention. Researchers also observed a decrease in the average antibiotic treatment duration.\n  The authors note that the design of the study prevents them from inferring that the intervention caused the change in prescribing, and that it's not possible to determine which components were associated with the improvements.\n  They conclude, \"Despite the limitations inherent in a nonexperimental study design, the methods and interventions developed in the current study may be informative to other learning health systems and other content areas when conducting organization-wide quality improvement initiatives.\"\nMar 3 Pediatrics abstract\n\nFunding for new drug-resistant malaria treatments announced  The European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) announced today that it will invest \u20ac21.9 million (US $24.5 million) to combat drug-resistant malaria in Africa and address other areas of urgent need in malaria treatment.\n  The EDCTP grant, awarded to the new PAMAfrica consortium led by the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), will support a clinical trial for new combinations of compounds for treating complicated and uncomplicated malaria that fully active against artemisinin-resistant strains. Two other trials will assess a rapid-acting treatment for severe malaria and a new malaria treatment for malnourished babies.\n  MMV, drug maker Novartis, and other partners will provide an additional \u20ac22 million (US $24.6 million) over 5 years.\n  \"Antimalarial drug resistance, originally seen in Southeast Asia, is being reported in Africa and may threaten current treatments,\" MMV Chief Scientific Officer Timothy Wells, PhD, said in a joint news release from EDCTP, MMV, and Novartis. \"It is important to have new therapies that are active against this emerging threat of resistance.\"\n  The PAMAfrica consortium includes Novartis and research organizations from Burkina Faso, Gabon, Germany, Mozambique, Spain, and Uganda.\nMar 3 EDCTP, MMV, Novartis news release",

Italian researchers ask for collaboration from Brazilian team\n\nEditorials: Health Sciences - Short URL: jornal.usp.br/?p=304338\nBy Karina Toledo, from FAPESP Agency Brazilian researchers manage to sequence the coronavirus genome - Art on photo NIH and 123RF\nThe genome of the coronavirus (covid-19) isolated in the second Brazilian patient diagnosed with the disease on Saturday, February 29, is different from that found in the first case, confirmed on February 26.\n\n\u201cThe first isolate proved to be genetically more similar to the virus sequenced in Germany. This second genome is more similar to that sequenced in England. And both are different from Chinese sequences. This fact suggests that the coronavirus epidemic is maturing in Europe, that is, internal transmission is already occurring in European countries. For a more accurate analysis, however, we need data from Italy, which has not yet been sequenced, \u201dsaid Ester Sabino, director of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (IMT) at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), to Ag\u00eancia Fapesp.\n\nThe complete sequencing of the second viral isolate was completed in just 24 hours by researchers from Instituto Adolfo Lutz and USP. The study data, supported by Fapesp, should be released soon.\n\nAfter the publication of the first Brazilian sequence of covid-19 on the Virological.org website, on February 28, Italian researchers contacted the USP team to request the sharing of the protocols used.\n\nThe viral isolates of the two Brazilian patients diagnosed with covid-19 were sequenced by a group coordinated by Claudio Tavares Sacchi, responsible for the Strategic Laboratory of the Adolfo Lutz Institute (LEIAL), and Jaqueline Goes de Jesus, postdoctoral fellow at the USP Medical School .\n\nThe work has been conducted with support from the Joint Brazil-UK Center for Discovery, Diagnosis, Genomics and Arbovirus Epidemiology (Cadde) - a network of researchers dedicated to responding and analyzing epidemic data in real time, coordinated by Sabino and Nuno Faria , from the University of Oxford, UK. The project, whose main focus is the study of arboviruses, such as dengue and zika, is supported by Fapesp, the Medical Research Council and the Newton Fund (the last two in the United Kingdom).\n\n\u201cOur initial objective was to train the Adolfo Lutz team and to implement the necessary technology for real-time monitoring of the dengue epidemic underway in Brazil. When the coronavirus cases in China were released in January, we started to prepare ourselves to also monitor this new disease in real time \u201d, said Sabino.  The samples were taken from the two Brazilian patients, who came from Italy - Photo: Cec\u00edlia Bastos / USP Imagens\nThe group makes use of a portable device known as MinION, used for the first time in the country in 2016 to retrospectively trace the spread and evolution of the Zika virus in the Americas (read more at http://agencia.fapesp.br/25356/) .\n\n\u201cThis agility is only possible now thanks to the continuous funding that our group at IMT-USP has received since 2016. The sequencing protocols were developed by a student during a research internship in Birmingham [United Kingdom]. We were able to lower the cost of the molecular test from US $ 500 [R $ 2,200] to US $ 20 [R $ 89]. It is a huge technological gain for the country, \u201dsaid Sabino.\n\nAccording to the researcher, the main advantage of real-time monitoring of an epidemic is the possibility of identifying where exactly the virus that arrived in the country came from. Such information can guide containment actions and help to reduce the spread of the disease.\n\n\"It is a new tool for epidemiological surveillance, which for the time being was only tested in Africa, during the Ebola epidemic,\" said Sabino. \u201cWe want to release this second sequence soon to help people in Italy analyze their data. We share with the Italians the protocol used by our team and put them in contact with the Cadde group in England. \u201d\n\nAccording to Sacchi, while only sporadic cases of covid-19 are confirmed in S\u00e3o Paulo, all genomes will be sequenced. If positive tests start to multiply on a large scale, the work will be guided by the Epidemiological Surveillance Center (CVE) of the State Department of Health, which is also part of the Cadde Project.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the sequencing will be done by sampling and based on statistical methods, in order to guarantee that the sampled cases are representative of the total\u201d, explained the researcher from Adolfo Lutz.\n\nIf it is possible to sequence a large number of viral isolates, several types of analysis may be performed in the future, such as the evolution of the virus and the identification of strains with the worst clinical evolution, for example.\n\nhttps://jornal.usp.br/ciencias/cienc...e-coronavirus/",

Eleven states have reported cases, with Washington State and California each reporting 18 cases, Illinois reporting 4, Oregon recording 3, Florida and Rhode Island each reporting 2 cases, and Arizona, Massachusetts, New York, Wisconsin, and New Hampshire each recording a single case, according to CNN Health.\n  One repatriated patient was released too early from quarantine in Texas, the CDC said in a letter posted by San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg on Twitter. The patient was released after two negative tests, but has now tested positive for the virus. He is back in quarantine.\nWashington confirms 18 cases, 6 deaths  Today health officials from King County, Washington addressed the growing outbreak there and in neighboring Snohomish County. At the heart of the outbreak is Life Care, a long-term care facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland that has seen 10 cases.\n  The 10 cases are part of the 18 total cases reported in Washington as of Monday afternoon, which include 14 in King County and 4 in Snohomish. At least two schools have closed in Snohomish County, but officials said that was an unnecessary step.\n  Washington state has also through today recorded six COVID-19 related deaths.\n  \"Several of our case patients are hospitalized,\" said Jeff Duchin, MD, King County public health officer. In addition to residents at Life Care, Duchin said some cases have no travel history or contact with confirmed cases. An additional possible 29 cases are currently waiting on test results.\n  The cases at Life Care were all detected after the CDC changed their recommendation for COVID-19 testing last week to include patients with unexplained pneumonia who tested negative for influenza.\nSeattle looks to motels, modular housing  At the beginning of the press conference, County Executive Dow Constantine said the city is in negotiations to buy a motel that can be used for case quarantine, and said they plan to use modular housing systems originally intended for Seattle's homeless population to house the sick. Constantine said the housing could be ready by the end of the week.\n  At this time, Duchin said no cases have been detected within the Seattle public school system, and the city is not recommending school closures at this time.\n  Duchin did say he was recommending that people over the age of 60 and those with underlying health conditions may want to avoid mass gatherings.\n  Throughout the press conference, Duchin emphasized that there will be a sea change in the way COVID-19 cases are tracked and monitored.\n  \"Within the coming weeks we will have more COVID-19 cases than flu, we won't be tracking individual cases, we will be tracking outbreaks,\" he said.\n  The University of Washington, in Seattle, will also begin testing for the virus.\n  \"Additional testing will find more cases,\" Duchin said.\n  Officials also used the press conference to emphasize basic hand hygiene and common sense approaches to the virus, reminding people that most infected patients will not need hospitalization and can treat mild to moderate illnesses at home.\nSeveral states note initial cases  Several other states reported new COVID-19 cases over the weekend, including New York City and Florida. The New York City case is in a 39-year old woman who returned from Iran last week. She is a health worker who is recovering at home.\n  California also reported more travel-related cases connected to Egypt, including three new cases from Santa Clara County. And two healthcare workers who were exposed to the first US case involving community spread\u2014in a woman from Solano County\u2014have also tested positive for the virus.\n  The Florida Department of Health tweeted late Sunday night the state had its first cases: one each in Hillsborough County and Manatee County.\n  And Rhode Island said it now has two cases, including one in a teenager, linked to a high school trip to Italy taken in mid-February. Others are being tested, and the 38 people who went on the trip are being asked to self-isolate and monitor themselves for symptoms for the next 14 days.",

Patients who had received more than nine antibiotic courses in the previous 3 years were found to be more than twice as likely to be admitted to the hospital with an infection within 3 to 6 months as those who'd received one course of antibiotics or fewer.\n  The authors of the study say the findings indicate that repeated prescribing of antibiotics, a common practice in UK primary care offices, has limited clinical benefit and could be increasing the risk of adverse outcomes.\nRisk rises with number of prescriptions  For the population-based cohort study, researchers from the University of Manchester and Public Health England analyzed health records from two databases covering primary care practices in England and Wales\u2014the Clinical Practice Research Databank (CPRD) and Secure Anonymized Information Linkage (SAIL) databases.\n  The study population consisted of more than 2 million patients prescribed an antibiotic from 2000 through 2017 for common infections, such as upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and ear infections. The analysis was restricted to patients with at least 3 years of history in the databases.\n  The primary outcome analyzed was hospital admission with infection-related complication that occurred in the 6 months after an antibiotic prescription. The researchers divided the patients into five groups based on the number of antibiotic prescriptions received in the previous three years: 0 to 1, 2, 3 to 4, 5 to 8, and 9 or more.\n  Overall, repeated antibiotic use was frequent, with patients in both databases on average receiving seven antibiotic prescriptions in the previous 3 years. Incidence of hospitalization linked to an infection was highest within the first 3 days after a prescription, and hospitalization rates were similar among all groups.\n  The adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) among CPRD patients was 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 1.04) when comparing infection-related hospitalization after 3 days in patients with the most previous antibiotic use (9 or more prescriptions) compared with those with the least. In both databases, most hospitalizations were for lower respiratory tract infections and pneumonia.\n  As time went on, infection-related hospitalization decreased, but much less so for patients with more frequent prior antibiotic use, who showed a sustained higher risk of hospitalization over time compared with the lowest-use group. The associated risk was highest in those who'd received 9 or more antibiotics in the previous 3 years. Within 4 to 30 days after a prescription, the rates of hospitalization were more than 50% higher (adjusted IRR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.34 to 1.72). Differences were even larger in the 3 to 6\u2009months after a prescription (adjusted IRR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.92 to 2.67).\n  The results were broadly similar in patients from the SAIL database, and were also similar when the analysis looked at patients with and without comorbidity.\nFrequent antibiotics don't help, may hurt  The researchers say it's unclear what exactly is behind the association between increased hospitalization risk and more frequent antibiotic use, but they offer a few potential explanations. For one, the results could be affected by patients who are immunocompromised and as a result suffer more infections, or have been colonized with resistant bacteria from previous hospitalizations.\n  In addition, frequent antibiotic use could be causing increased resistance, resulting in infections that are harder to treat and require hospitalization.\n  But another possibility\u2014one that's been suggested in previous research\u2014is that frequent antibiotic use could be disrupting the balance of bacteria in the gut (the intestinal microbiota) in ways that enable colonization with resistant pathogens or make patients more susceptible to infections caused by those pathogens. The researchers acknowledge, however, that their study does not provide direct evidence to support this hypothesis, and that further work is needed to test it.\n  While that question remains unanswered, the researchers conclude that what's clear from this study and previous studies is that there is little evidence that frequent and repeated antibiotic use for common infections is actually clinically effective.\n  \"In conclusion, there is little evidence in the literature for the clinical effectiveness of repeated antibiotic use in primary care although [it] is common practice,\" they wrote. \"Antimicrobial stewardship interventions should target these patients with high use of antibiotics but apparently limited value.\"",

WHO officials emphasized today that patterns vary in different countries, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to battling the virus. \"Our message to all countries is: This is not a one-way street. We can push this virus back,\" he said. \"Our actions now will determine the course of the outbreak in your country.\"\n  In its daily situation report today, the WHO said there are now 8,774 cases outside of China, 128 of them fatal, in 64 countries.\n  In response developments at the global level, the United Nations yesterday\u2014prompted by sudden surges in the three main hot spots\u2014released $15 million from its central emergency response fund to help contain COVID-19, which will go to the WHO and UNICEF.\n  Mark Lowcock, the UN's humanitarian chief, said in a statement, \"This grant from the UN's Emergency Fund will help countries with fragile health systems boost their detection and response operations. It has the potential to save the lives of millions of vulnerable people.\"\nMore Mideast countries affected  Iran's health ministry today reported 523 more cases, a steep increase from the 395 new cases reported yesterday, for a total of 1,501. Health officials also reported 11 more deaths, raising the country's fatality count to 66.\n  The WHO's Eastern Mediterranean regional office said in a statement today that the Iran mission's goals are to understand transmission patterns, provide guidance on scaling up the response, and stepping up preparedness for areas in the country that haven't been affected yet.\n  Iran's outbreak has led to travel-linked cases in at least 10 other countries. The WHO said the plane that brought the technical team also included personal protective equipment for 15,000 healthcare workers and test kits to diagnose nearly 100,000 people.\n  Elsewhere in the Middle East and North African region, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Tunisia reported their first cases, Al Jazeera reported. Saudi Arabia's case was linked to an Iran traveler, while the Jordan and Tunisia cases were linked to Italy travel. Also, Morocco reported its first case, which involved a citizen who lives in Italy, Reuters reported.\n  Elsewhere in Africa, Senegal reported its first case, involving a man who had just returned from France, according to a separate Reuters report. Senegal is the second sub-Saharan African country to report a case; the other is Nigeria.\nKorea tops 4,000 cases, China tops 80,000  South Korea today reported 475 cases today, plus 4 more deaths, boosting its overall total to 4,212 cases, which includes 26 deaths.\n  In China, the National Health Commission reported 202 new cases, down from 573 reported yesterday, increasing the overall to 80,026. The country also 42 more deaths and 255 fewer serious cases, putting the new respective totals at 2,912 and 7,110.\n  All but six of China's cases were from Hubei province.\n  In other Asian developments:Japan's health ministry today reported 9 more cases, raising its total to 241.The latest cases were in Ehime, Kochi, Niigata, Hokkaido, Kanagawa, and Osaka prefectures. The country lists its overall number at 241, with 27 asymptomatic pathogen carriers.\nIndonesia today reported its first cases today, which involve people who had contact with a sick person from Japan, Reuters Given the number of Asian nations reporting outbreaks, some experts have raised concerns about the potential for underreporting in Indonesia.\nSingapore's health ministry today reported 2 new cases, raising its total to 108. One is linked to a known workplace cluster, and the other is a contact of an earlier case.\nWith Italy surge, ECDC urges plan activation  Europe's main hot spot, Italy, today reported 258 new cases, raising its total to 1,835, plus 18 more deaths, raising the total to 52. Three northern regions are still the hardest-hit areas, but 2 cases were confirmed in Rome, in a police officer and a firefighter, The Guardian reported today, citing a local hospital that said four of the police officer's family members were also infected.\n  Three more European countries reported their first cases: Latvia, Portugal, and Andorra. Latvia didn't list an exposure source for its patient, Portugal had two cases that involved Italy and Spain travelers, and Andorra's patient is a man who had been in Italy.\n  Meanwhile, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said today in its latest risk assessment that the risk to the region is moderate to high. \"The virus spreads rapidly, and can have an enormous public health impact with substantial fatal outcomes in high-risk groups and economic and societal disruption,\" it said.\n  So far, nearly 2,000 cases have been reported in the European region, with 75% of the cases and 92% of the deaths reported from Italy. It urged countries to activate their pandemic preparedness plans to ensure containment and mitigation with nonpharmaceutical public health interventions.\n  The ECDC said it based its risk assessment on an increasing number of cases without a known transmission chain, and despite strong response steps, cases continue to be exported between countries, along with new introductions from countries outside of China.",

The new cases bring the February case tally to 18 and the March tally to 1.\n  The Riyadh MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) cases involve men aged 73, 60, 56, 52, and 38 years old. The case in Taif involves a 53-year-old man, and the Mecca case involves a 56-year-old man.\n  All exposures are listed as primary, meaning the patients are unlikely to have contracted the virus from another person. The MOH said that none of the infected patients were healthcare workers and that only one had reported contact with camels, a known risk factor for MERS. The remaining patients' exposure to camels is unknown.\n  Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe illness and death. The virus can transmit between humans but has done so mainly in healthcare settings, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  \n  As of Jan 31, 2020, the WHO said that it had received reports of 2,519 laboratory-con\ufb01rmed MERS infections, including 866 associated deaths. The vast majority of these cases occurred in Saudi Arabia.\n  The WHO said that it expects more cases of MERS-CoV to be reported from the Middle East and that it will spread to other countries by people infected through exposure to camels, animal products such as raw camel's milk, or other humans.\nMar 2 Saudi MOH report\nFeb 29 Saudi MOH report\n\nEleven new polio cases reported in Pakistan and Africa  Two cases of wild polio virus type 1 (WPV1) infection in Pakistan's Punjab province and nine cases of circulating vaccine-derived polio virus type 2 (cVDPV2) in West Africa were reported the week of Feb 26, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI).\n  The African cVDPV2 cases occurred in Benin's Plateau province (1 case), Ghana's Bono province (3) and Bono East province (3), and Togo's Lome province (1) and Maritime province (1).  \n  The Togo case is related to a cVDPV2 outbreak affecting Jigawa, Nigeria, the GPEI said.\n  The 11 new cases bring the global 2020 WPV1 case total to 12, all in Pakistan, and the cVDPV2 total to 15.

Many patients in the ED have common community-acquired infections caused by bacteria sensitive to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, the researchers wrote.\n\n\"We conclude that the literature supports prompt administration of effective antibiotics for septic shock and meningitis, but there is no clear evidence showing that a delayed start of therapy is associated with worse outcome for less severe infectious syndromes,\" the investigators said. \"This approach promotes the use of ecologically favourable antibiotics in the ED, reducing the risks of side effects and selection of resistance.\"\n\nThe researchers, who found few studies in the literature on mild to moderate infections, called for stronger evidence from prospective clinical trials.\nFeb 28 Clin Microbiol Infect abstract\n\nCombo antibiotic for resistant UTIs shows promise in phase 3 trialFrench biopharmaceutical company Allecra Therapeutics announced last week that its investigational combination drug Exblifep met the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency's pre-specified primary end point and demonstrated superiority over piperacillin-tazobactam in a phase 3 trial of patients who had complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs).\n\nThe topline results from the phase 3 ALLIUM trial showed that the overall success of Exblifep in cUTI patients was 79.1%, compared with 58.9% for piperacillin-tazobactam.

I wake up in the middle of the night, fearing for my family and my parents. I have been told I tend to be a hypochondriac, so I might be overreacting, but I\u2019m at the point of considering wearing a mask around town. I want my family to do the same, but my husband thinks I\u2019m nuts.  How can I deal with this in a sane way?\n\nBlair\n\n\nThanks for writing in, as we\u2019re all in this together. I\u2019ll start by clarifying that we\u2019re not qualified to discuss details about the nature of the virus, but we do have expertise in helping you deal with the uncertainty of life. There is no doubt that this is indeed a serious situation in everyone\u2019s life. With Japan closing schools for a month and China and Italy isolating communities, we have reasonable cause for concern, so your thoughts are valid.\n\nWhat we do have to watch, however, is the tendency to indulge in catastrophic thinking. Mark Twain said it well when he wrote, \u201cMy life has been filled with terrible misfortunes, most of which have never happened.\u201d We can spend so much of our time ruminating about what might happen that we end up living in a constant state of panic that\u2019s not only unnecessary, but unhelpful.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said in previous columns, what you\u2019re experiencing is a very old instinctual reaction to a threat. Your tendency to lean into the worst-case scenario, and recite Chicken Little\u2019s famous statement, \u201cThe sky is falling, the sky is falling!\u201d is a very savvy coping mechanism that has enabled humanity to exist for hundreds of thousands of years and outlive many other species. After all, if your ancestors hadn\u2019t held a keen ear to the bushes and moved to higher ground in the presence of a threat, they wouldn\u2019t have survived. While it served us well when we were hunters and gatherers, this state of high alert doesn\u2019t always serve us today.

A cow in the cattle barn developed rabies and was capable of spreading the virus that causes it during those dates. The solid black cow, a Brangus heifer, was being shown by a student from the Miller Grove ISD in Hopkins County.\n\nThe cow was only outside of the barn while being shown and loaded and unloaded for transport. Public health officials have been in contact with the people who were caring for the cow and the animals in nearby stalls, so their risk can be assessed.\n\nRabies is spread through the saliva of infected animals. Anyone who put their hand in the cow\u2019s mouth or nose or had contact between the animal\u2019s saliva and an open wound or mucous membrane like the eyes, nose or mouth should be evaluated for a rabies exposure. Someone in that situation should contact their health care provider as soon as possible and explain the situation. People who didn\u2019t have that kind of contact with the cow are not at risk of contracting the disease.\n\nRabies can be prevented if treatment is started before symptoms begin, however, once symptoms start, it\u2019s almost always fatal. It usually takes between three weeks and three months for someone exposed to rabies to get sick.\n\nBexar County residents who visited the cattle barn on those dates and have questions may contact the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District at 210-207-8876. People who live elsewhere may contact their DSHS regional Zoonosis Control office.

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "Interim Guidance for Administrators of US Childcare Programs and K-12 Schools to Plan, Prepare, and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available. Please check the following CDC website periodically for updated interim guidance: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html.\n\nHealth officials are currently taking steps to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 into US communities. Schools can play an important role in this effort. Through collaboration and coordination with local health departments, schools can take steps to disseminate information about the disease and its potential transmission within their school community. Schools can prepare to take steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among their students and staff should local health officials identify such a need.\n\nSchools should continue to collaborate, share information, and review plans with local health officials to help protect the whole school community, including those with special health needs. School plans should be designed to minimize disruption to teaching and learning and protect students and staff from social stigma and discrimination. Plans can build on everyday practices (e.g., encouraging hand hygiene, monitoring absenteeism, communicating routinely) that include strategies for before, during, and after a possible outbreak.\n\nWho is this guidance for?\n\nThis interim guidance is intended to help administrators of public and private childcare programs and K-12 schools prevent the spread of COVID-19 among students and staff. Administrators are individuals who oversee the daily operations of childcare programs and K-12 schools, and may include positions like childcare program directors, school district superintendents, principals, and assistant principals. This guidance is intended for administrators at both the school/facility and district level.\n\nWhy is this guidance being issued?\n\nInformation provided should help childcare programs, schools, and their partners understand how to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19 within childcare and school communities and facilities. It also aims to help childcare programs, schools, and partners to react quickly should a case be identified. The guidance includes considerations to help administrators plan for the continuity of teaching and learning if there is community spread of COVID-19.\n\nWhat is the role of schools in responding to COVID-19?\n\nCOVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) virus, and we are learning more about it every day. There is currently no vaccine to protect against COVID-19. At this point, the best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to the virus that causes it. Stopping transmission (spread) of the virus through everyday practices is the best way to keep people healthy. More information on COVID-19 is available here.\n\nSchools, working together with local health departments, have an important role in slowing the spread of diseases to help ensure students have safe and healthy learning environments. Schools serve students, staff, and visitors from throughout the community. All of these people may have close contact in the school setting, often sharing spaces, equipment, and supplies. Guidance for schools which do not have COVID-19 identified in their communityTo prepare for possible community transmission of COVID-19, the most important thing for schools to do now is plan and prepare. As the global outbreak evolves, schools should prepare for the possibility of community-level outbreaks. Schools want to be ready if COVID-19 does appear in their communities.\n\nChildcare and K-12 school administrators nationwide can take steps to help stop or slow the spread of respiratory infectious diseases, including COVID-19:Review, update, and implement emergency operations plans (EOPs). This should be done in collaboration with local health departments and other relevant partners. Focus on the components, or annexes, of the plans that address infectious disease outbreaks.Ensure the plan includes strategies to reduce the spread of a wide variety of infectious diseases (e.g., seasonal influenza). Effective strategies build on everyday school policies and practices.\nEnsure the plan emphasizes common-sense preventive actions for students and staff. For example, emphasize actions such as staying home when sick; appropriately covering coughs and sneezes; cleaning frequently touched surfaces; and washing hands often.CDC has workplace resources such as posters with messages for staff about staying home when sickpdf icon and how to avoid spreading germs at workpdf icon.\nOther health and education professional organizations may also have helpful resources your school can use or share. For example, the American Academy of Pediatrics provides information on germ prevention strategiesexternal icon and reducing the spread of illness in childcare settingsexternal icon.\n\nEnsure handwashing strategies include washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.CDC offers several free handwashing resources that include health promotion materials, information on proper handwashing technique, and tips for families to help children develop good handwashing habits.\n\nReference key resources while reviewing, updating, and implementing the EOP:Multiple federal agencies have developed resources on school planning principles and a 6-step process for creating plans to build and continually foster safe and healthy school communities before, during, and after possible emergencies. Key resources include guidance on developing high-quality school emergency operations planspdf iconexternal icon, and a companion guide on the role of school districts in developing high-quality school emergency operations planspdf iconexternal icon.\nThe Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools (REMS) Technical Assistance (TA) Center\u2019s websiteexternal icon contains free resources, trainings, and TA to schools and their community partners, including many tools and resources on emergency planning and response to infectious disease outbreaks.\n\nDevelop information-sharing systems with partners.Information-sharing systems can be used for day-to-day reporting (on information such as changes in absenteeism) and disease surveillance efforts to detect and respond to an outbreak.\nLocal health officials should be a key partner in information sharing.\n\nMonitor and plan for absenteeism.Review the usual absenteeism patterns at your school among both students and staff.\nAlert local health officials about large increases in student and staff absenteeism, particularly if absences appear due to respiratory illnesses (like the common cold or the \u201cflu,\u201d which have symptoms similar to symptoms of COVID-19).\nReview attendance and sick leave policies. Encourage students and staff to stay home when sick. Use flexibility, when possible, to allow staff to stay home to care for sick family members.\nDiscourage the use of perfect attendance awards and incentives.\nIdentify critical job functions and positions, and plan for alternative coverage by cross-training staff.\nDetermine what level of absenteeism will disrupt continuity of teaching and learning.\n\nEstablish procedures for students and staff who are sick at school.Establish procedures to ensure students and staff who become sick at school or arrive at school sick are sent home as soon as possible.\nKeep sick students and staff separate from well students and staff until they can leave.\nRemember that schools are not expected to screen students or staff to identify cases of COVID-19. The majority of respiratory illnesses are not COVID-19. If a community (or more specifically, a school) has cases of COVID-19, local health officials will help identify those individuals and will follow up on next steps.\nShare resources with the school community to help families understand when to keep children home. This guidance, not specific to COVID-19, from the American Academy of Pediatrics can be helpful for familiesexternal icon.\n\nPerform routine environmental cleaning.Routinely clean frequently touched surfaces (e.g., doorknobs, light switches, countertops) with the cleaners typically used. Use all cleaning products according to the directions on the label.\nProvide disposable wipes so that commonly used surfaces (e.g., keyboards, desks, remote controls) can be wiped down by students and staff before each use.\n\nCreate communications plans for use with the school community.Include strategies for sharing information with staff, students, and their families.\nInclude information about steps being taken by the school or childcare facility to prepare, and how additional information will be shared.\n\nReview CDC\u2019s guidance for businesses and employers.Review this CDC guidance to identify any additional strategies the school can use, given its role as an employer.\n\n\n\nChildcare and K-12 administrators can also support their school community by sharing resources with students (if resources are age-appropriate), their families, and staff. Coordinate with local health officials to determine what type of information might be best to share with the school community. Consider sharing the following fact sheets and information sources:Information about COVID-19 available through state and localexternal icon health departments\nGeneral CDC fact sheets to help staff and students\u2019 families understand COVID-19 and the steps they can take to protect themselves:What you need to know about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)pdf icon\nWhat to do if you are sick with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nStop the spread of germs \u2013 help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19pdf icon\n\nCDC Information on COVID-19 and children\nCDC information for staff, students, and their families who have recently traveled back to the United States from areas where CDC has identified community spread of coronavirus:A list of countries where community spread of COVID-19 is occurring can be found on the CDC webpage: Coronavirus Disease 2019 Information for Travel\n\n\nFor questions about students who plan to travel, or have recently traveled, to areas with community spread of COVID-19, refer to CDC\u2019s FAQ for travelers. Schools can also consult with state and local health officials. Schools may need to postpone or cancel trips that could expose students and staff to potential community spread of COVID-19. Students returning from travel to areas with community spread of COVID-19 must follow guidance they have received from health officials. COVID-19 information for travel is updated regularly on the CDC website.\n\nTop of Page Guidance for schools with identified cases of COVID-19 in their communityIf local health officials report that there are cases of COVID-19 in the community, schools may need to take additional steps in response to prevent spread in the school. The first step for schools in this situation is to talk with local health officials. The guidance provided here is based on current knowledge of COVID-19. As additional information becomes available about the virus, how it spreads, and how severe it is, this guidance may be updated. Administrators are encouraged to work closely with local health officials to determine a course of action for their childcare programs or schools.\n\nDetermine if, when, and for how long childcare programs or schools may need to be dismissed.\n\nTemporarily dismissing childcare programs and K-12 schools is a strategy to stop or slow the further spread of COVID-19 in communities. During school dismissals, childcare programs and schools may stay open for staff members (unless ill) while students stay home. Keeping facilities open a) allows teachers to develop and deliver lessons and materials remotely, thus maintaining continuity of teaching and learning; and b) allows other staff members to continue to provide services and help with additional response efforts.\n\nChildcare and school administrators should work in close collaboration and coordination with local health officials to make dismissal and large event cancellation decisions. Schools are not expected to make decisions about dismissal or canceling events on their own. Schools can seek specific guidance from local health officials to determine if, when, and for how long to take these steps. Large event cancellations or school dismissals*** may be recommended for 14 days, or possibly longer if advised by local health officials. The nature of these actions (e.g., geographic scope, duration) may change as the local outbreak situation evolves.\n\nIf an ill student or staff member attended school prior to being confirmed as a COVID-19 case:Local health officials may recommend temporary school dismissals if a student or staff member attended school prior to being confirmed as a COVID-19 case. Local health officials\u2019 recommendations for the scope (e.g., a single school, a full district) and duration of school dismissals will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the most up-to-date information about COVID-19 and the specific cases in the impacted community.\nSchools should work with the local health department and other relevant leadership to communicate the possible COVID-19 exposure. This communication to the school community should align with the communication plan in the school\u2019s emergency operations plan. In such a circumstance, it is critical to maintain confidentiality of the student or staff member as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act.\nIf a student or staff member has been identified with COVID-19, school and program administrators should seek guidance from local health officials to determine when students and staff should return to schools and what additional steps are needed for the school community. In addition, students and staff who are well but are taking care of or share a home with someone with a case of COVID-19 should follow instructions from local health officials to determine when to return to school.\n\nIf schools are dismissed, schools can consider the following steps:Temporarily cancel extracurricular group activities and large events.Cancel or postpone events such as after-school assemblies and pep rallies, field trips, and sporting events.\n\nDiscourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere.Discourage gatherings at places like a friend\u2019s house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.\n\nEnsure continuity of education.Review continuity plans, including plans for the continuity of teaching and learning. Implement e-learning plans, including digital and distance learning options as feasible and appropriate.\nDetermine, in consultation with school district officials or other relevant state or local partners:If a waiver is needed for state requirements of a minimum number of in-person instructional hours or school days (seat time) as a condition for funding;\nHow to convert face-to-face lessons into online lessons and how to train teachers to do so;\nHow to triage technical issues if faced with limited IT support and staff;\nHow to encourage appropriate adult supervision while children are using distance learning approaches; and\nHow to deal with the potential lack of students\u2019 access to computers and the Internet at home.\n\nEnsure continuity of meal programs.Consider ways to distribute food to students.\nIf there is community spread of COVID-19, design strategies to avoid distribution in settings where people might gather in a group or crowd. Consider options such as \u201cgrab-and-go\u201d bagged lunches or meal delivery.\n\nConsider alternatives for providing essential medical and social services for students.Continue providing necessary services for children with special healthcare needs, or work with the state Title V Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs (CYSHCN) Program.\n\n\n\nTop of Page\nPage last reviewed: February 16, 2020\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...r-schools.html",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this interim guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available.\n\nCDC is working across the Department of Health and Human Services and across the U.S. government in the public health response to COVID-19. Much is unknown about how the virus that causes COVID-19 spreads. Current knowledge is largely based on what is known about similar coronaviruses.\n\nCDC Industry GuidanceResources for Airlines\nResources for the Ship Industry\n\nCDC Business Sector\n\nDr. Messonnier provides a situational update on COVID-19 for CDC private sector partners.\n\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in humans and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people, such as with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person in China and some limited person-to-person transmission has been reported in countries outside China, including the United States. However, respiratory illnesses like seasonal influenza, are currently widespread in many US communities.\n\nThe following interim guidance may help prevent workplace exposures to acute respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, in non-healthcare settings. The guidance also provides planning considerations if there are more widespread, community outbreaks of COVID-19.\n\nTo prevent stigma and discrimination in the workplace, use only the guidance described below to determine risk of COVID-19. Do not make determinations of risk based on race or country of origin, and be sure to maintain confidentiality of people with confirmed COVID-29. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features of COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing. Updates are available on CDC\u2019s web page at www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/covid19.  Recommended strategies for employers to use now:Actively encourage sick employees to stay home:Employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness are recommended to stay home and not come to work until they are free of fever (100.4\u00b0 F [37.8\u00b0 C] or greater using an oral thermometer), signs of a fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicines (e.g. cough suppressants). Employees should notify their supervisor and stay home if they are sick.\nEnsure that your sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and that employees are aware of these policies.\nTalk with companies that provide your business with contract or temporary employees about the importance of sick employees staying home and encourage them to develop non-punitive leave policies.\nDo not require a healthcare provider\u2019s note for employees who are sick with acute respiratory illness to validate their illness or to return to work, as healthcare provider offices and medical facilities may be extremely busy and not able to provide such documentation in a timely way.\nEmployers should maintain flexible policies that permit employees to stay home to care for a sick family member. Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual.\n\nSeparate sick employees:CDC recommends that employees who appear to have acute respiratory illness symptoms (i.e. cough, shortness of breath) upon arrival to work or become sick during the day should be separated from other employees and be sent home immediately. Sick employees should cover their noses and mouths with a tissue when coughing or sneezing (or an elbow or shoulder if no tissue is available).\n\nEmphasize staying home when sick, respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene by all employees:Place posters that encourage staying home when sick, cough and sneeze etiquette, and hand hygiene at the entrance to your workplace and in other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen.\nProvide tissues and no-touch disposal receptacles for use by employees.\nInstruct employees to clean their hands often with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60-95% alcohol, or wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Soap and water should be used preferentially if hands are visibly dirty.\nProvide soap and water and alcohol-based hand rubs in the workplace. Ensure that adequate supplies are maintained. Place hand rubs in multiple locations or in conference rooms to encourage hand hygiene.\nVisit the coughing and sneezing etiquette and clean hands webpage for more information.\n\nPerform routine environmental cleaning:Routinely clean all frequently touched surfaces in the workplace, such as workstations, countertops, and doorknobs. Use the cleaning agents that are usually used in these areas and follow the directions on the label.\nNo additional disinfection beyond routine cleaning is recommended at this time.\nProvide disposable wipes so that commonly used surfaces (for example, doorknobs, keyboards, remote controls, desks) can be wiped down by employees before each use.\n\nAdvise employees before traveling to take certain steps:Check the CDC\u2019s Traveler\u2019s Health Notices for the latest guidance and recommendations for each country to which you will travel. Specific travel information for travelers going to and returning from China, and information for aircrew, can be found at on the CDC website.\nAdvise employees to check themselves for symptoms of acute respiratory illness before starting travel and notify their supervisor and stay home if they are sick.\nEnsure employees who become sick while traveling or on temporary assignment understand that they should notify their supervisor and should promptly call a healthcare provider for advice if needed.\nIf outside the United States, sick employees should follow your company\u2019s policy for obtaining medical care or contact a healthcare provider or overseas medical assistance company to assist them with finding an appropriate healthcare provider in that country. A U.S. consular officer can help locate healthcare services. However, U.S. embassies, consulates, and military facilities do not have the legal authority, capability, and resources to evacuate or give medicines, vaccines, or medical care to private U.S. citizens overseas.\n\nAdditional Measures in Response to Currently Occurring Sporadic Importations of the COVID-19:Employees who are well but who have a sick family member at home with COVID-19 should notify their supervisor and refer to CDC guidance for how to conduct a risk assessment of their potential exposure.\nIf an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Employees exposed to a co-worker with confirmed COVID-19 should refer to CDC guidance for how to conduct a risk assessment of their potential exposure.\n\nPlanning for a Possible COVID-19 Outbreak in the USThe severity of illness or how many people will fall ill from COVID-19 is unknown at this time. If there is evidence of a COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S., employers should plan to be able to respond in a flexible way to varying levels of severity and be prepared to refine their business response plans as needed. For the general American public, such as workers in non-healthcare settings and where it is unlikely that work tasks create an increased risk of exposures to COVID-19, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low. The CDC and its partners will continue to monitor national and international data on the severity of illness caused by COVID-19, will disseminate the results of these ongoing surveillance assessments, and will make additional recommendations as needed. Planning ConsiderationsAll employers need to consider how best to decrease the spread of acute respiratory illness and lower the impact of COVID-19 in their workplace in the event of an outbreak in the US. They should identify and communicate their objectives, which may include one or more of the following: (a) reducing transmission among staff, (b) protecting people who are at higher risk for adverse health complications, (c) maintaining business operations, and (d) minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains. Some of the key considerations when making decisions on appropriate responses are:Disease severity (i.e., number of people who are sick, hospitalization and death rates) in the community where the business is located;\nImpact of disease on employees that are vulnerable and may be at higher risk for COVID-19 adverse health complications. Inform employees that some people may be at higher risk for severe illness, such as older adults and those with chronic medical conditions.\nPrepare for possible increased numbers of employee absences due to illness in employees and their family members, dismissals of early childhood programs and K-12 schools due to high levels of absenteeism or illness:\nEmployers should plan to monitor and respond to absenteeism at the workplace. Implement plans to continue your essential business functions in case you experience higher than usual absenteeism.\nCross-train personnel to perform essential functions so that the workplace is able to operate even if key staff members are absent.\nAssess your essential functions and the reliance that others and the community have on your services or products. Be prepared to change your business practices if needed to maintain critical operations (e.g., identify alternative suppliers, prioritize customers, or temporarily suspend some of your operations if needed).\n\nEmployers with more than one business location are encouraged to provide local managers with the authority to take appropriate actions outlined in their business infectious disease outbreak response plan based on the condition in each locality.\nCoordination with stateexternal icon and localexternal icon health officials is strongly encouraged for all businesses so that timely and accurate information can guide appropriate responses in each location where their operations reside. Since the intensity of an outbreak may differ according to geographic location, local health officials will be issuing guidance specific to their communities.\nImportant Considerations for Creating an Infectious Disease Outbreak Response PlanAll employers should be ready to implement strategies to protect their workforce from COVID-19 while ensuring continuity of operations. During a COVID-19 outbreak, all sick employees should stay home and away from the workplace, respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene should be encouraged, and routine cleaning of commonly touched surfaces should be performed regularly. Employers should:Ensure the plan is flexible and involve your employees in developing and reviewing your plan.\nConduct a focused discussion or exercise using your plan, to find out ahead of time whether the plan has gaps or problems that need to be corrected.\nShare your plan with employees and explain what human resources policies, workplace and leave flexibilities, and pay and benefits will be available to them.\nShare best practices with other businesses in your communities (especially those in your supply chain), chambers of commerce, and associations to improve community response efforts.\nRecommendations for an Infectious Disease Outbreak Response Plan:Identify possible work-related exposure and health risks to your employees. OSHA has more information on how to protect workers from potential exposuresexternal icon to COVID-19.\nReview human resources policies to make sure that policies and practices are consistent with public health recommendations and are consistent with existing state and federal workplace laws (for more information on employer responsibilities, visit the Department of Labor\u2019sexternal icon and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019sexternal icon websites).\nExplore whether you can establish policies and practices, such as flexible worksites (e.g., telecommuting) and flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts), to increase the physical distance among employees and between employees and others if state and local health authorities recommend the use of social distancing strategies. For employees who are able to telework, supervisors should encourage employees to telework instead of coming into the workplace until symptoms are completely resolved. Ensure that you have the information technology and infrastructure needed to support multiple employees who may be able to work from home.\nIdentify essential business functions, essential jobs or roles, and critical elements within your supply chains (e.g., raw materials, suppliers, subcontractor services/products, and logistics) required to maintain business operations. Plan for how your business will operate if there is increasing absenteeism or these supply chains are interrupted.\nSet up authorities, triggers, and procedures for activating and terminating the company\u2019s infectious disease outbreak response plan, altering business operations (e.g., possibly changing or closing operations in affected areas), and transferring business knowledge to key employees. Work closely with your local health officials to identify these triggers.\nPlan to minimize exposure between employees and also between employees and the public, if public health officials call for social distancing.\nEstablish a process to communicate information to employees and business partners on your infectious disease outbreak response plans and latest COVID-19 information. Anticipate employee fear, anxiety, rumors, and misinformation, and plan communications accordingly.\nIn some communities, early childhood programs and K-12 schools may be dismissed, particularly if COVID-19 worsens. Determine how you will operate if absenteeism spikes from increases in sick employees, those who stay home to care for sick family members, and those who must stay home to watch their children if dismissed from school. Businesses and other employers should prepare to institute flexible workplace and leave policies for these employees.\nLocal conditions will influence the decisions that public health officials make regarding community-level strategies; employers should take the time now to learn about plans in place in each community where they have a business.\nIf there is evidence of a COVID-19 outbreak in the US, consider canceling non-essential business travel to additional countries per travel guidance on the CDC website.\nTravel restrictions may be enacted by other countries which may limit the ability of employees to return home if they become sick while on travel status.\nConsider cancelling large work-related meetings or events.\n\nEngage stateexternal icon and localexternal icon health departments to confirm channels of communication and methods for dissemination of local outbreak information.\nResources for more information: CDC GuidanceCOVID-19 Website\nWhat You Need to Know About COVID-19pdf icon\nWhat to Do If You Are Sick With COVID-19pdf icon\nInterim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Exposure in Travel-associated or Community Settings\nHealth Alert Network\nTravelers\u2019 Health Website\nNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health\u2019s Small Business International Travel Resource Travel Plannerpdf icon\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 Recommendations for Ships\nOther Federal Agencies and PartnersOSHA Guidance: https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/novel_coronavirus/index.htmlexternal icon\n\nPage last reviewed: February 26, 2020",

The experts consulted by Efe are emphatic in their statement: the lack of medicines and supplies, the difficulties of the public health sector and the lack of diagnostic centers are reasons that discourage this possibility.\n\nAlthough the Government has expanded epidemiological surveillance, as explained last week by the Minister of Health, Carlos Alvarado, it is insufficient to face the eventual entry of this virus into the country, since it requires very strict measures with which no Venezuela says, in the opinion of infectious doctors Julio Castro and Jaime Torres.\n\nEXPERTS VS. GOVERNMENT\n\nWhile the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Executive intends to reassure the population with the activation of a \"health emergency operations center\" and \"a national biosafety committee to study the whole issue that has to do with the management of the coronavirus,\" Experts say the protocol is insufficient.\n\nIn addition, the Government maintains an epidemiological surveillance system activated in five international airports since last month, during which time \u201cpatients have been followed up until now from China (where the epidemic originated)\u201d and for the moment \u201cnone from them he has developed symptoms, \u201dAlvarado said.\n\nBut as explained by the infectologist doctor Castro to Efe, it is not enough, since \u201cit is a big issue, because it involves training of human resources, supplies, medicines, information, surveillance system and notification (of cases). The minister said there is technical equipment for diagnosis, but that is not all the preparation.\n\nFor his part, Dr. Torres does not doubt that there are detection kits in Venezuela, but he remarks on the problem that there are not many diagnostic centers prepared and on \u201cthe difficulties of the public health sector, hospital capacity, ability to provide services\".\n\nVENEZUELA, BETWEEN THE WORST PREPARED COUNTRIES\n\nCastro wonders how many doctors in the Venezuelan health system are prepared to diagnose, make isolation or protection measures for the equipment and measures Venezuela by international reports where a country's readiness index is calculated based on its outcome indicators: \u00ab We are among the last in the world \u00bb.\n\nTorres goes further and extends the poor preparation to \"a large part of the countries of the Latin American region\", which \"are not prepared for the arrival of the coronavirus, and that includes Venezuela.\"\n\n\"The only way to contain the virus and prevent it from spreading is with very strict, very massive measures, with the participation of the population, health and safety authorities that are not easy to implement,\" says the doctor, who believes that the country The Caribbean is not trained to face an epidemic of these characteristics.\n\nTHE CORONAVIRUS IN LATIN AMERICA\n\nIn Latin America, cases of coronavirus, suspected or confirmed, are still counted on the fingers of one hand and in Venezuela none have yet been reported.\n\nThe first affected in the region was registered in Brazil, where there are already two cases, which set off alarms in Venezuela and boosted the surveillance of international ports and border crossings, and led the Government to reassure the population announcing that the country has with virus detection kits.\n\nThen four cases were detected in Mexico and this weekend was alerted to the presence of a new infected person in Ecuador and another in the Dominican Republic, both cases from Spain and Italy respectively.\n\nNO OFFICIAL DATA\n\nBoth infectologists, Castro and Torres, point out that one of the problems is that there is no official information regarding any disease in Venezuela, since the Epidemiological Bulletin has not been published since 2017.\n\n\"There are data on some diseases that are reported to regional health authorities and that goes to the Pan American Health Organization, but in Venezuela there are no figures,\" Torres tells EFE.\n\nThe precedent is the previous epidemics of Zika and Chikungunya, both diseases that have spread strongly in Latin America.\n\n\u00abIn those other epidemics we did not know the cases. The Venezuelan government made very late official notification. There were a few thousand cases, about 2,000, which were the ones that tested positive for blood tests. Our calculations is that it could have reached 20-25% of the population, \u201dsays Castro.\n\nA BIOLOGICAL WAR AGAINST CHINA?\n\nDuring a recent government activity broadcast on national radio and television networks, Maduro said that \u201cthere are many analyzes in the world that show that the coronavirus can be a strain created for the biological war against China (\u2026) and against the peoples of the world \u00bb. Venezuela, he said, \"fortunately\" has a plan to face \"this attack.\"\n\nHowever, he did not detail what analysis he refers to and, if there is one, the president's words would only confirm that \"it can be ...\", leaving in the air a possibility that leaves a big question open...",

It was surprising that having cases in so many countries in Europe there were none in Portugal,\" said Rebelo de Sousa. EFE",

This outbreak has been tentatively associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of zoonotic infection. Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for 2019-nCoV, the identity of any intermediate host facilitating transfer to humans is unknown.\n\nHere, we report the identification of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin associated CoVs that belong to two sub-lineages of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses, including one very closely related to 2019-nCoV in the receptor-binding domain.\n\nThe discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to 2019-nCoV suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible intermediate hosts for this novel human virus and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.\n\nFebruary 18, 2020.",

A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent and was subsequently termed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Considered a relative of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus that affects the lower respiratory tract and manifests as pneumonia in humans. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with 50,580 laboratory-confirmed cases and 1,526 deaths worldwide.

Preliminary Identification of Potential Vaccine Targets for the COVID-19 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Based on SARS-CoV Immunological Studies.Ahmed SF1, Quadeer AA1, McKay MR1,2.\nAuthor informationAbstract   The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the 120 available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  2019 novel coronavirus; 2019-nCoV; B cell epitopes; COVID-19; Coronavirus; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2; T cell epitopes; vaccine\n\n PMID: \t32106567 \tDOI: \t10.3390/v12030254",

[Epub ahead of print]  Coronavirus Disease 2019: Coronaviruses and Blood Safety.Chang L1, Yan Y1, Wang L2.\nAuthor informationAbstract   With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, a new coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), aroused the attention of the entire world. The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Two other coronavirus infections-SARS in 2002-2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012-both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans. All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by \u03b2-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is common. Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products. Because more and more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 cases, considerations of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen especially in endemic areas. In this review, we detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 through blood products as of February 10, 2020, and also discuss pathogen inactivation methods on coronaviruses.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.

With the spread of the disease, similar cases have also been confirmed in other regions of China. We aimed to report the imaging and clinical characteristics of these patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China.\nMETHODS:  All patients with laboratory-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were collected between January 23, 2020, and February 4, 2020, in a designated hospital (Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital). This analysis included 90 patients (39 men and 51 women; median age, 50 years (age range, 18-86 years). All the included SARS-CoV-2-infected patients underwent non-contrast enhanced chest computed tomography (CT). We analyzed the clinical characteristics of the patients, as well as the distribution characteristics, pattern, morphology, and accompanying manifestations of lung lesions. In addition, after 1-6 days (mean 3.5 days), follow-up chest CT images were evaluated to assess radiological evolution.\nFINDINGS:  The majority of infected patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan or to infected patients and mostly presented with fever and cough. More than half of the patients presented bilateral, multifocal lung lesions, with peripheral distribution, and 53 (59%) patients had more than two lobes involved. Of all included patients, COVID-19 pneumonia presented with ground glass opacities in 65 (72%), consolidation in 12 (13%), crazy paving pattern in 11 (12%), interlobular thickening in 33 (37%), adjacent pleura thickening in 50 (56%), and linear opacities combined in 55 (61%). Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and lymphadenopathy were uncommon findings. In addition, baseline chest CT did not show any abnormalities in 21 patients (23%), but 3 patients presented bilateral ground glass opacities on the second CT after 3-4 days.\nCONCLUSION:  SARS-CoV-2 infection can be confirmed based on the patient's history, clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, and laboratory tests. Chest CT examination plays an important role in the initial diagnosis of the novel coronavirus pneumonia. Multiple patchy ground glass opacities in bilateral multiple lobular with periphery distribution are typical chest CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia; COVID-19; Computed tomography; Ground glass opacification; Imaging features; Infection; SARS-CoV-2\n\n PMID: \t32107577 \tDOI: \t10.1007/s00259-020-04735-9",

Several studies on the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection were collected for Meta-analysis.\nRESULTS:  Ten studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 50466 patients with 2019-nCoV infection. Meta-analysis shows that, among these patients, the incidence of fever was 89.1%, the incidence of cough was 72.2%, and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 42.5%. The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 14.8%, the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 96.6%, the percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 18.1%, and the case fatality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection was 4.3%.\nCONCLUSION:  Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and most of these patients have abnormal chest CT examination. Several people have muscle soreness or fatigue as well as ARDS. Diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms only occur in a small number of patients. The case fatality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection is lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).

Genetically, it is closely related to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The situation is getting worse and worse, therefore, there is an urgent need for designing a suitable peptide vaccine component against the SARS-COV-2. Here, we characterized spike glycoprotein to obtain immunogenic epitopes. Next, we chose 13 Major Histocompatibility Complex-(MHC) I and 3 MHC-II epitopes, having antigenic properties. These epitopes are usually linked to specific linkers to build vaccine components and molecularly dock on Toll-Like Receptor (TLR)-5 to get binding affinity. Therefore, in order to provide a fast immunogenic profile of these epitopes we performed immunoinformatics analysis so that rapid development of vaccine might bring this disastrous situation to the end earlier.

Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pulmonary illness coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, more than 79,000 people have contracted the virus worldwide. The virus is rapidly spreading with human-to-human transmission despite imposed precautions. Because similar pulmonary syndromes have been reported from other strains of the coronavirus family, our aim is to review the lessons from imaging studies obtained during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks. CONCLUSION. The review of experiences with the MERS and SARS outbreaks will help us better understand the role of the radiologist in combating the outbreak of COVID-19. The known imaging manifestations of the novel coronavirus and the possible unknowns will also be discussed.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  COVID-19; CT scan; chest; coronavirus; outbreak; pneumonia; radiography\n\n PMID: \t32108495 \tDOI: \t10.2214/AJR.20.22969",

This application allows the identification of phylogenetic clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format. Since its release in 2019, we have produced a number of typing tools for emergent viruses that have caused large outbreaks, such as Zika and Yellow Fever Virus in Brazil. Here, we present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of the available public data for SARS-CoV-2. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines to stop the COVID-19 disease.\nAVAILABILITY: https://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/cov.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\n  \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

[Epub ahead of print]  COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship: estimating the epidemic potential and effectiveness of public health countermeasures.Rockl\u00f6v J1, Sj\u00f6din H1, Wilder-Smith A2,3,4.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  Cruise ships carry a large number of people in confined spaces with relative homogeneous mixing. On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on cruise ship Diamond Princess was reported with 10 initial cases, following an index case on board around 21-25 January. By 4 February, public health measures such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine of non-ill passengers were implemented. By 20 February, 619 of 3,700 passengers and crew (17%) were tested positive.\nMETHODS:  We estimated the basic reproduction number from the initial period of the outbreak using (SEIR) models. We calibrated the models with transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data. We additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures, and established a model stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of differential contact rates among the groups. We also compared scenarios of an earlier versus later evacuation of the ship.\nRESULTS:  The basic reproduction rate was initially 4 times higher on-board compared to the ${R}_0$ in the epicentre in Wuhan, but the countermeasures lowered it substantially. Based on the modeled initial ${R}_0$ of 14.8, we estimated that without any interventions within the time period of 21 January to 19 February, 2920 out of the 3700 (79%) would have been infected. Isolation and quarantine therefore prevented 2307 cases, and lowered the ${R}_0$ to 1.78. We showed that an early evacuation of all passengers on 3 February would have been associated with 76 infected persons in their incubation time.\nCONCLUSIONS:  The cruise ship conditions clearly amplified an already highly transmissible disease. The public health measures prevented more than 2000 additional cases compared to no interventions. However, evacuating all passengers and crew early on in the outbreak would have prevented many more passengers and crew from infection.\n  \u00a9 International Society of Travel Medicine 2019.

Real time RT-PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples.\nRESULTS:  Of the 80 patients infected with COVID-19, 41 patients were female, with a median age of 46.1 years. Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. 9 patients were unconfirmed until a third-time nucleic acid test. 38 cases had a history of chronic diseases. The main clinical manifestations of the patients were fever and cough, which accounted for 63 cases (78.75%) and 51 cases (-63.75%) respectively. Only 3 patients (3.75%) showed liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 55 patients (-68.75%) showed abnormal, 25 cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of both lungs. Up to now, 21 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patient died. The average length of stay for discharged patients was 8 days.\nCONCLUSIONS:  Compared with the cases in Wuhan, the cases in Jiangsu exhibited mild or moderate symptoms and no obvious gender susceptivity. The proportion of patients having liver dysfunction and abnormal CT imaging was relatively lower than that of Wuhan. Notably, infected patients may be falsely excluded based on two consecutively negative respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test results.\n  \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

The clinical and imaging data were analyzed.\nRESULTS:  Fifty patients were enrolled, including mild type in nine, common in 28, severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three. Mild patients (29 years) were significantly (P<0.03) younger than either common (44.5 years) or severe (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also significantly (P<0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients. Mild patients had low to moderate fever (<39.1\u00b0C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein. Nine mild patients were negative in CT imaging. For all the other types of NCP, the lesion was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22, right lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36. The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension towards the pulmonary hilum. Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15. The density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass opacity as the primary presentation accompanied by partial consolidation and fibrosis.\nCONCLUSION:  CT imaging presentations of NCP are mostly patchy ground glass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura with partial consolidation which will be absorbed with formation of fibrotic stripes if improved. CT scanning provides important bases for early diagnosis and treatment of NCP.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020.

Real-time forecasts of the COVID-19 epidemic in China from February 5th to February 24th, 2020.Roosa K1, Lee Y1, Luo R1, Kirpich A1, Rothenberg R1, Hyman JM2, Yan P3, Chowell G1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   The initial cluster of severe pneumonia cases that triggered the COVID-19 epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409-7496 additional confirmed cases in Hubei and 1128-1929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 and 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588-13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th - 9th). We also observe that each of the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other provinces. Our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.\n  \u00a9 2020 The Authors.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  COVID-19; China; Coronavirus; Phenomenological models; Real-time forecasts\n\n PMID: \t32110742 \tPMCID: \tPMC7033348 \tDOI: \t10.1016/j.idm.2020.02.002",

Vasoconstrictor drugs should be used rationally and alerting of complications is of the same importance. The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) needs to be assessed, and effective prevention should be carried out for high-risk patients. It is necessary to consider the possibility of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in patients with sudden onset of oxygenation deterioration, respiratory distress, reduced blood pressure. However, comprehensive analysis of disease state should be taken into the interpretation of abnormally elevated D-Dimer. Nutritional support is the basis of treatment. It's important to establish individual therapy regimens and to evaluate, monitor and adjust dynamically. Under the current epidemic situation, convalescent plasma can only be used empirically, indications need to be strictly screened, the blood transfusion process should be closely monitored and the curative effect should be dynamically evaluated.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:\n\nConvalescent plasma; Coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19; Nutritional support; Vasoconstrictor drugs; Venous thromboembolism\n\nPMID: 32111113 DOI: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200224-00159",

The virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus.\nMETHODS:\n\nIn this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model. The next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R0) from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2.\nRESULTS:\n\nThe value of R0 was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3.58.\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nOur model showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East countries, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but lower than MERS in the Republic of Korea.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:\n\nBasic reproduction number; Mathematical model; Next generation matrix; Novel coronavirus; Transmissibility\n\nPMID: 32111262 DOI: 10.1186/s40249-020-00640-3",

The aim of this paper was to describe the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.\nMETHODS:  In this retrospective cohort study, 149 RT-PCR confirmed positive patients were consecutively enrolled from January 17th to February 10th, 2020 in three tertiary hospitals of Wenzhou. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 15th, 2020.\nFINDINGS:  A total of 85 patients had Hubei travel/residence history, while another 49 had contact with people from Hubei and 15 had no traceable exposure history to Hubei. Fever, cough and expectoration were the most common symptoms, 14 patients had decreased oxygen saturation, 33 had leukopenia, 53 had lymphopenia, and 82 had elevated C reactive protein. On chest computed tomography, lung segments 6 and 10 were mostly involved. A total of 287 segments presented ground glass opacity, 637 presented mixed opacity and 170 presented consolidation. Lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung with a patchy form. No significant difference was found between patients with or without Hubei exposure history. Seventeen patients had normal CT on admission of these, 12 had negative findings even10 days later.\nINTERPRETATION:  Most patients presented with a mild infection in our study. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral ground glass or mixed opacity with predominance in the lower lung is highly suspicious of COVID-19 in the first week of disease onset. Nevetheless, some patients can present with a normal chest finding despite testing positive for COVID-19.\nFUNDING:  We did not receive any fundings.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020.

We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Beijing.\nMETHODS:  We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Sevice to the designated hospitals. The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID-19 virus, diagnostic classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained. Furthermore we compared the characteristics between severe and common confirmed cases which including mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS.\nFINDINGS:  By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beijing emergency medical service. Among of 262 patients, 46 (17.6%) were severe cases, 216 (82.4%) were common cases, which including 192 (73.3%) mild cases, 11(4.2%) non-pneumonia cases and 13 (5.0%) asymptomatic cases respectively. The median age of patients was 47.5 years old and 48.5% were male. 192 (73.3%) patients were residents of Beijing, 50 (26.0%) of which had been to Wuhan, 116 (60.4%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 21 (10.9%) had no contact history. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (82.1%), cough (45.8%), fatigue (26.3%), dyspnea (6.9%) and headache (6.5%). The median incubation period was 6.7 days, the interval time from between illness onset and seeing a doctor was 4.5 days. As of Feb 10, 17.2% patients have discharged and 81.7% patients remain in hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in Beijing was 0.9%.\nINTERPRETATION:  On the basis of this study, we provided the ratio of the COVID-19 infection on the severe cases to the mild, asymptomatic and non-pneumonia cases in Beijing. Population was generally susceptible, and with a relatively low fatality rate. The measures to prevent transmission was very successful at early stage, the next steps on the COVID-19 infection should be focused on early isolation of patients and quarantine for close contacts in families and communities in Beijing.\nFUNDING:  Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission and Ministry of Science and Technology.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The follow-up with chest X-Rays and CT scans was also included, showing a progressive adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nRESULTS:  Moderate to severe progression of the lung infiltrates, with increasing percentage of high-density infiltrates sustained by a bilateral and multi-segmental extension of lung opacities, were seen. During the follow-up, apart from pleural effusions, a tubular and enlarged appearance of pulmonary vessels with a sudden caliber reduction was seen, mainly found in the dichotomic tracts, where the center of a new insurgent pulmonary lesion was seen. It could be an early alert radiological sign to predict initial lung deterioration. Another uncommon element was the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy with short-axis oval nodes.\nCONCLUSIONS:  Although only two patients have been studied, these findings are consistent with the radiological pattern described in literature. Finally, the pulmonary vessels enlargement in areas where new lung infiltrates develop in the follow-up CT scan, could describe an early predictor radiological sign of lung impairment.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020.

To try to stop the virus\u2019 transmission and restrain the outbreak, they need to identify every single person with whom patients have come into contact, isolate those at risk of harboring the illness, and monitor the entire network of people for symptoms.\n\nThat\u2019s hard even if you know how each patient became infected. If you don\u2019t, it can be downright herculean. The fact that the pathogen is passing through people without making them sick enough to seek care means that they may have unwittingly transmitted it for weeks before it came to the attention of authorities. Once a case is discovered, epidemiologists still need to figure out whom the patient might have exposed. But they also need to look in the other direction, too, to figure out by what unseen route the virus reached that person in the first place.\n\n\u201cThe question is, what is their source of exposure?\u201d said Laurence Burnsed, state epidemiologist for Oklahoma\u2019s health department. \u201cWho are we missing?\u201d\n\nAnswering such questions requires state and county health agencies \u2014 overworked as they already are \u2014 to ramp up their efforts as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cSpeed is critical. Speed is absolutely critical. Every country that is receiving their first cases needs to act robustly and aggressively. \u2026 Look for this virus,\u201d said Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the emerging diseases and zoonoses unit for the World Health Organization\u2019s global infectious hazard preparedness team, in an interview with STAT...",

The Snohomish County man had traveled to Wuhan at a time when there were only 300 cases in China. He was seen at a clinic, where his specimens were collected and sent to the CDC. After his COVID-19 infection as confirmed, he was taken to Providence Regional Medical Center for treatment.\n  Trevor Bedford, PhD, in Twitter comments from the open-source pathogen genome analysis project Nextstrain, said the sequence from the new case descends on a branch from the earlier Snohomish County sequence, strongly suggesting transmission in the area over the past 6 weeks, which could have resulted in a few hundred cases. Bedford is a computational biologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.\n  He said the two sequences could also reflect separate introductions, though highly unlikely. \"I believe we're facing an already substantial outbreak in Washington State that was not detected until now due to narrow case definition requiring direct travel to China.\"\nTwo new Washington cases, both in critical condition  Today, Public Health\u2013Seattle & King County reported two more cases, based on state lab testing. One of the patients is a man in his 60s with underlying health conditions who is hospitalized at Valley Medical Center in Renton. He has underlying health conditions and is in critical but stable condition.\n  The second patient is also a man in his 60s with chronic health conditions. He is hospitalized at Virginia Mason Medical Center, where he is listed in critical condition.\n  Also, the health department addressed a report of an infected US Postal Service worker, noting that the patient is one of four cases reported yesterday. Media reports said the postal employee worked at a package handling facility in Seattle.\nCases in Rhode Island, California, and Illinois  The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDH) said today that the patient is in his or her 40s and had traveled to Italy in the middle of February. It added that the patient had traveled little since returning from Italy and had not returned to work. Nicole Alexander-Scott, MD, MPH, said today at a media briefing that the patient had also been in France and Spain.\n  The person is isolated in the hospital, and family members are in home quarantine. Health officials are in the process of identifying other contacts.\n  Last night, California's Santa Clara County reported another case, an adult woman who is a household contact of a community-spread case it announced on Feb 28. The newly reported patient is not hospitalized or sick. Also last night, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and Cook County announced a presumed positive, but had no other details about the patient, pending CDC final confirmation. Public health officials are tracing contacts and have asked the CDC to deploy a team to help with the efforts. The case is the third to be detected in Illinois; the earlier two were a woman who got sick after a Wuhan trip and her husband, who didn't travel but contracted the virus from his wife.",

It also reported 35 more deaths and 299 fewer serious cases, bringing those respective totals to 2,870 and 7,365.\n  The number of cases in China's hard-hit Hubei province has increased for 2 days in a row, following a period of decline, the WHO said today in its daily situation update. It said it is monitoring the situation and is working to assess the significance of the uptick.\n  Japan's health ministry today added 15 new cases to its total, which rose to 232, though it lists its overall number as 232 with 22 asymptomatic carriers. The illnesses were reported from eight different prefectures. And Singapore today reported 4 more cases, 3 linked to an apparent workplace cluster, lifting its total to 106.\nItaly reports gush of cases, more countries report first cases  Italy today reported 528 more cases, up dramatically from 161 reported yesterday, boosting its total to 1,577. Five more people died from their infections, raising the country's fatality count to 34. Lombardy, Veneto, and Emilia-Romagna regions make up most of the cases, but illnesses have been reported from 13 others.\n  At least five more countries today reported their first cases, all linked to Italy travel: they include the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Ireland, Scotland, and Luxembourg.\n  Meanwhile, several other already affected European countries reported more cases, including countries where local or sustained transmission is suspected. For example, England today reported 21 new cases, raising its total to 33. Chris Whitty, CB, DSC, the UK's chief medical officer, said on Twitter that 3 were known contacts of a previous case and 1 had no known exposure to an earlier case or a relevant travel history. Of the other 8, 6 had traveled to Italy and 2 had been in Iran.\n  France has now reported 130 cases, and Paris' Louvre museum has temporarily closed, due to its guards' fears of exposure to the virus due to visits from international travelers, Reuters reported. And Germany has 129 cases, roughly half of them from North Rhine-Westphalia state, according to the latest numbers from the Robert Koch Institute.\nIran reports sharp rise, totals grow in other Mideast countries  In the Middle East, Iran's health ministry today reported 385 more cases, up sharply from 205 reported yesterday, for a total of 978 cases. Eleven more people died, raising Iran's fatality count to 54. Of today's new cases, 170 were from Tehran.\n  Lebanon, which like several other Middle East countries recently reported its first case linked to Iran travel, reported 3 more, raising its total to 7. The World Health Organization Lebanon office said on Twitter that 3 of the new cases are related the country's fourth case, signaling limited local transmission.\n  Iraq today reported 6 more cases, all linked to Iran travel, including the first in its Kurdistan region, Reuters reported. Four were from Sulaymaniyah in Kurdistan and 2 were from Baghdad.\n  So far, 11 countries in the WHO's Middle East region have reported 1,130 cases as of today, up from 723 in its report yesterday.",

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "A note of caution about confirmed case numbers.\n\nI\u2019ve seen lots of people recently comparing coronavirus and flu numbers so I want to do a dive in to each.\n\nThe US publishes an Influenza surveillance update (FluView) each week. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm The most recent was published on Feb 27 and covered week 8, the week ending Feb 22 so it\u2019s already a little out of date.\nThe data for week 8 indicates 42,587 cases were tested and 11,249 were positive for flu. The CDC also publishes a weekly estimate on the number of flu cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the US. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden...-estimates.htm The latest estimate was also published Feb 27 and covered the period up to week 8. Between weeks 7 and 8, an estimated 3-4 million influenza cases were added. In other words, CDC testing captures a very tiny 0.4% of all cases.\n\nLet\u2019s look at hospitalization data. Fluview gives 15,319 confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations between October 1 and Feb 22. This is an increase of 1,544 over the previous week. In contrast, the CDC estimates that 30,000-60,000 flu hospitalizations actually occurred that week. A figure at least 20 times higher than the captured number. The reasons for this are manifold, but one scenario plays out as follows; someone contracts flu, fights it for a few days, immune system is stressed, overcomes the flu, but develops pneumonia that requires hospitalization. By the time testing is performed, the flu virus is long gone.\n\nAnd finally, mortality data. Little known fact, the Week 8 FluView does not give week 8 mortality data. It always gives data from the previous week due to serious lags in compilation and reporting. The data presented represents week 7 (ending Feb 15). Going to the original source of this data,  https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/mortality.html you find that at the time of publication (Feb 27), the week 7 data (ending Feb 15) was still only 82.3% complete. Still, 313 coded influenza and 2,401 coded pneumonia deaths happened that week. Using CDC estimates for weeks 6-7, an estimated 2-5,000 influenza deaths actually occurred that week.\n\nIn summary, 42,587 influenza tests discovered at best 0.4% of estimated cases, 5% of hospitalized cases, and 16% of fatal cases.\n\nOn Feb 16, the CDC reported that they had performed a total of 479 Coronavirus tests with 15 positives https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/...296#post830296 , this number dropped to 413 on Feb 20, but increased by Feb 23, to a total of 426 tests performed with 53 positives including 39 repatriated persons from Wuhan (3) and the Diamond Princess (36). I\u2019m guessing that the reduction is due to the realization that the test was faulty, and some test results were thrown out. Either way you are looking at the most at a few dozen tests performed during that week.\n\nWhat fraction of cases & fatalities do you think those tests captured?\n\n\nResources:\nArchived flu mortality data & estimates for 2019-20 https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/...illance-system\nArchived FluView 2019-20 https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/...luview-2019-20",

At the federal level, officials today announced new travel restrictions involving Iran, parts of Italy, and parts of South Korea.\n  And in international novel coronavirus developments, cases continued to surge in the three main hot spots, two countries reported cases imported from Egypt, and at least three more countries reported their first cases: Ecuador, Monaco, and Qatar.\nWashington officials also probe nursing home cluster  At a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) briefing today, Nancy Messonnier, MD, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the cases lift the number detected by the US public health system to 22. She add that, although the illnesses are still under investigation, they raise the level of concern for certain communities in the United States.\n  Jeffrey Duchin, MD, health officer with Public Health\u2013Seattle & King County, said that, of the three new cases reported by Washington today, none appear to be linked to travel and are considered presumed positives.\n  Two are related to LifeCare Center, a long-term care facility in Kirkland. One involves a female healthcare worker who is hospitalized in satisfactory condition at Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue, and the other patient is a 70-year-old resident who is in serious condition at EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland.\n  Duchin said health officials are evaluating several other people with symptoms at the facility, including 27 of 108 residents and 25 of 180 staff. A CDC team is expected to arrive tonight to assist with the investigation.\n  The fatal case, which he said doesn't appear to be linked to the nursing home outbreak, involves a man in his 50s with underlying medical conditions who was hospitalized at EvergreenHealth Medical Center.\n  Notice of the three new cases in Washington state today follow announcements last night of two other cases of community transmission in the state, involving a high school boy and a woman who had traveled to South Korea. Combined with cases announced yesterday by California and Oregon, the United States now has seven community-transmission cases.\nWhite House officials unveil new response steps  At a White House media briefing, President Donald Trump and other federal officials expressed their condolences to the family of the Washington patient.\n  Trump said the country took aggressive early actions, and though more cases are likely, the risk to the nation is still low and infections are mild for most people. He also added that he will meet with pharmaceutical companies at the White House on Monday to discuss issues related to the development of drugs and vaccines.\n  Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the White House's COVID-19 task force, detailed new travel restrictions, similar to the temporary ban announced in late January on people coming from China. The new measures apply to all travelers coming from Iran, including other foreign nationals, and travelers coming from the most affected areas of Italy and South Korea.\n  He also said discussions are under way to step up medical screening in people in other affected countries who will be traveling to the United States. He added that the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response is taking steps to increase the availability of masks\u2014designed to provide 34 million more a month\u2014to protect healthcare workers.\n  Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said community spread now being reported in the United States will require a focus on state and local public health measures to identify and isolate cases and trace contacts. \"The country as a whole is still at low risk, but this is an evolving situation.\"\nCases outside China surge past 6,000  The CDC yesterday boosted travel warnings for Iran and Italy to the highest level, which urges people to avoid nonessential travel due to widespread community transmission and limited access to medical care.\n  In Iran, the health ministry reported 205 more cases and 9 more deaths, raising those respective totals to 595 and 43. Italy today reported 161 more cases and 8 more deaths, lifting its respective totals to 1,049 and 29.\n  The pace of new infections surged even higher in South Korea, with 813 more cases reported today, raising the country's total to 3,150. Four more people died from their infections, putting the fatality count at 17. In one of the daily updates today, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention detailed epidemiologic information on the first 16 deaths, all involving patients who had underlying medical conditions. The deaths occurred mainly in seniors, though 1 involved a patient in his 30s. Six were younger than 60, and 10 were male.\n  In Iran, the health ministry reported 205 more cases and 9 more deaths, raising those respective totals to 595 and 43.\n  Elsewhere in Asia, China reported 427 new cases, raising its overall total to 79,251, according to the National Health Commission daily update. It also reported 47 more deaths and 288 fewer serious cases, putting those respective totals at 2,835 and 7,664.\n  Japan reported 9 more cases, 4 of them from the hot spot in Hokkaido, for a total of 217, and Singapore reported 4 new infections, all linked to the same workplace cluster, raising its total to 102.\n  In other developments, two countries\u2014Canada and France\u2014reported cases imported from Egypt, though only one case has been reported in Egypt. The country's health ministry said it is in contact with Canada and France, following the detection of a case in a Canadian man who been in Egypt and two French travelers who apparently contracted the virus there, according to a media report that cited Egypt's health ministry.\n  At least three countries reported their first cases today: Qatar (Iran travel), Monaco, and Ecuador (Spain travel).\n  Several already affected countries reported new cases, including France, which announced a temporary ban on indoor gatherings of more than 5,000 people.\n  The World Health Organization said today in its latest daily situation report that over the past 24 hours it received 1,318 new reports of illnesses outside China, raising the total to 6,009 from 53 countries.",

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "Pandemics Are More Than Just About The CFR\n\n\n\n\n#14,996\n\nAlthough everyone naturally worries about the mortality rate of a pandemic, even a relatively low mortality - high morbidity epidemic can provide major challenges to our economy, our society, and most importantly our health care delivery system.\nWhile the case mortality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 is uncertain, it appears greater than what we see with seasonal flu, and it may well be significantly greater. Time will tell. \nBut what is apparent is it highly contagious, and some significant percentage of cases require hospitalization. Those that are hospitalized, tend to require 2 to 3 weeks of care. Even if most survive, that's an incredible burden on the healthcare system.\n\nThe notion that COVID-19 doesn't appear to be all that deadly - or that it mainly kills older people with comorbidities - may be reassuring (assuming you aren't old, or have comorbidities), but it doesn't really tell you how big of an impact it will have on our society or economy.\n\nEven though I'm in the `high risk' category, I worry far more about the cascading indirect impacts of COVID-19 than I do the virus itself.\n\nCase in point, overnight local media (KIRO-TV) in Washington State is reporting that 25 1st responders who had contact with patients at the LTCF where two people have tested positive are going into home quarantine (video below)\n\n\n\nWhile hopefully none of these 1st responders is infected, EMS services work with very little slack in their ranks. Take 25 people out of service for 2 weeks, and it will have a serious impact on their agency's ability to deliver essential services.\nNow replicate this scenario in hundreds of city or county EMS services across the country over the next couple of months. We may well see a fair number of HCWs or 1st responders test positive, further depleting the workforce. \nThese precautionary quarantines are probably prudent early in a pandemic, but will likely become increasingly less common once the virus begins broadly circulating in the community. By then, attrition due to actual infection, or the need to stay home to care for an infected loved one, will begin take its toll (see HCWs Willingness To Work During A Pandemic).\nIf schools close, many working parents - including HCWs - may be forced to stay home. If their kids get sick, that number goes up even higher. \nThese same impacts are likely to be felt across a wide spectrum workplaces, and so even if we see a relatively low CFR, the impacts on the delivery of goods and services will probably suffer (see Supply Chain Of Fools (Revisited).\nWe could see shortages and/or delays in everything from food deliveries to prescription drugs, lapses in the delivery of public utilities (water & electricity), or replacement parts for your car or computer. \nIn 2005 Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of CIDRAP, likened a severe pandemic to an 18-month global blizzard, where nearly everything is shut down. Many will be without a paycheck, either due to their refusal to work and risk exposure, because they are out sick, or because their jobs are simply no longer available (see Baby, it's Cold Outside).\n\nMore recently, in his 2017 book Deadliest Enemy (see my Review: Deadliest Enemy: Our War Against Killer Germs), Dr. Osterholm revisited the idea of our JIT (just in time) economy, and wrote:\nIronically, the ways we have organized the modern world for efficiency, economic development, and for enhanced lifestyle -- the largely successful attempts to transform the planet into a global village -- have made us more susceptible to the effects of infectious disease than we were in 1918.\nAnd the more sophisticated, complex, and technologically integrated the world becomes, the more vulnerable we will be to one disastrous element devastating the entire system. \n\nWhile hopefully we can find ways around many of these challenges, we are almost certainly going to see some significant disruptions to our lives in the months ahead. I can't tell you right now what they will look like, or how bad they may be.\nIt will likely vary wildly by location. Some places may come away relatively unscathed. \nBut with pandemics, you have to prepared for surprises.\n\nhttps://afludiary.blogspot.com/2020/...about-cfr.html",

Historically, the number of patients has grown since March.\nJoshua Caleb by Joshua Caleb\nFebruary 29, 2020\n\nIn the same month that Brazil confirmed its first case of a patient with a new type of coronavirus that emerged in China, an old acquaintance of Brazilians showed signs that it will infect even more people in 2020: the dengue virus, transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito .\n\nThe latest epidemiological bulletin from the Ministry of Health with data on dengue shows that the number of probable cases of the disease - those that are notified to the folder by the States - grew 19% in the first five weeks of the year compared to the same period in 2019 .\n\n94,149 probable cases were reported up to the fifth week of the year (more precisely from 12/29/2019 to 2/1/2020), compared to 79,131 in the same period last year.\n\nAt the beginning of 2020, there is confirmation that at least 14 people died from dengue in the country. The comparison of deaths with 2019 is still uncertain, as the numbers can still change significantly as the results of laboratory analyzes arrive and as states and municipalities send their reports to the ministry. The data in the current bulletin, for example, still does not compute the cases and deaths recorded at the local level in February.\n\nBut the ministry is already working with a scenario of increasing dengue cases for this year, and some municipalities and states across the country have declared an alert for a dengue epidemic - which is defined when there is a rate of 300 confirmed cases of disease for every 100 thousand population.\n\nToday, the country has an average incidence of 44.8 probable cases for every 100 thousand inhabitants, a value that is also higher than that registered in the bulletin of the same period last year (26.3 cases per 100 thousand; the comparison between newsletters from different years should be done with caution, as there are many changes and updates to numbers after they are published).\n\nThe situation varies drastically within the country, and three states have already shot more than 200 cases per 100 thousand inhabitants: Acre (rate of 281.65 / 100 thousand); Mato Grosso do Sul (249.98 / 100 thousand) and Paran\u00e1 (220.75 / 100 thousand).\n\nHowever, the upward trend in dengue this year can only be confirmed in the coming months - historically, the number of patients grows from March.\n\nExperts and government representatives interviewed by BBC News Brasil attribute the upward trend in dengue in 2020 to a combination of factors: first and perhaps more importantly, a powerful new circulation cycle for serotype 2 (there are 4 serotypes of the dengue virus, one classification that corresponds to the response of different antibodies in the infected); in addition to this, particular weather conditions in recent months and cultural and behavioral factors of the population.\nOver 8 thousand patients in a week in Paran\u00e1\n\nMaps of cases of the disease make the highlight in a part of the country that begins in Acre, passes through the Midwest and part of the Southeast, ending in Paran\u00e1. Northeastern states, such as Para\u00edba and Pernambuco, had few cases compared to units in other regions.\n\nIn Paran\u00e1, the data on the growth of dengue is impressive. In February last year, the Ministry of Health pointed out that the State had 14 patients per 100 thousand inhabitants; today, that number reaches 220.7 - an increase of 1,471% in the incidence when comparing bulletins for the two periods.\n\nSince August, when the State started counting a new epidemiological period, almost 35 thousand cases of the disease have been confirmed. In the last week alone, there were 8,200 new patients. Also according to the state government, 14 people died of dengue this year - because they are provided by the state, these data are more up to date than those compiled by the Ministry of Health.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we have an upward curve of the disease. The trend is for an impacting worsening situation, as the period with the highest incidence is yet to start in March, \u201dsays Ivana Belmonte, coordinator of environmental surveillance at the Paran\u00e1 Department of Health.\n\nAccording to her, the change in the type of circulating virus is one of the explanations for the increase in dengue in the State and in much of Brazil. From 2010 to last year, the vast majority of people who had dengue in Paran\u00e1 were infected with type 1 of the disease. As of August 2019, serotype 2 was responsible for 83% of dengue infections in the state.\n\n\nA person can have the four serotypes of the disease, but once infection with one of them has occurred, permanent immunity is acquired for this type.\n\n\u201cWhen you get type 1, you are immunized against it. That is why, after a discharge, the number of cases tends to decrease over a period. However, when the circulating serotype changes to 2, people are not immunized and end up contracting the disease. This is what is happening in Paran\u00e1 and elsewhere \u201d, explains Belmonte.\nDengue serotype 2 advances in the country\n\nIn fact, according to information sent by the Ministry of Health to BBC News Brasil, the participation of serotype 2 in the number of dengue cases has grown in the last five years in the country, reaching the highest percentage in 2019: 65.6% of cases, followed by serotype 1 (30.4%) and serotype 4 (3.9%). Data for 2019 are preliminary and, for 2020, are not yet available.\n\n\"At the end of 2018, type 2 of the dengue virus returned to circulation after 10 years and has been finding populations susceptible to the disease since then,\" explained the ministry in a note sent to the report.\nCreator of the '10 minutes against Aedes' campaign recalls that most mosquito breeding sites are inside people's homes\nCARLOS BASSAN / MUNICIPALITY OF CAMPINAS\n\nBiologist Denise Valle, a researcher at the Flavivirus Molecular Biology Laboratory at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute (IOC / Fiocruz) and creator of the \u201c10 minutes against Aedes\u201d campaign, explains that, in 2019, serotype 2 has already pushed the number up dengue cases in several states. However, for several other places, the arrival of this type of virus is a novelty and, therefore, the numbers for 2020 must be high as well.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, serotype 2 circulated a lot, but it did not circulate in all regions of Brazil. In addition, we are having a very wet summer, with a lot of rain - which also helps to increase the number of breeding sites \u201d, he points out.\n\nValle explains that the country is \u201chyper endemic for dengue, with epidemic periods\u201d - which means, with \u201cendemic\u201d, that infections occur all year round, despite growing in the summer; and, with \u201chyper\u201d, that there is more than one serotype circulating. The researcher also points out that, due to its continental dimensions, the country has different patterns of contamination by state and even within the same city.\n\nBut, for the biologist, it is worth noting what has been observed in the South in recent years, symbolized in this 2020 with the presence of Paran\u00e1 among the Brazilian states with the most cases.\n\n\u201cBrazil has dengue all the time, but the South, with a colder climate, a higher Human Development Index (HDI) and better structured cities, was delaying the installation of Aedes aegypti. Today we see a consolidation of the installation of dengue in the South as well \u201d, points out Valle.\n'You can't wait for the government to clean your yard'\n\nDespite pointing to the importance of sanitation and urbanization in controlling the Aedes aegypti mosquito - which also transmits zika and chicungunha -, Valle draws attention to the role of people in combating dengue and other diseases.\n\n\u201cAedes is a domestic mosquito. Of every 10 breeding sites, 8 are inside people's homes \u201d, he highlights.\n\nIvana Belmonte also mentions climate issues, such as increased rainfall in certain regions, in addition to cultural issues to explain the progress of dengue in Paran\u00e1 this year.\n\n\u201cThe culture of eliminating mosquito breeding sites is still small in Brazil. It is necessary to make the population even more aware that the risk is real, that you or a relative may die of dengue, \u201dhe explains.\n\nAccording to her, municipalities in Paran\u00e1 have been working together to verify and eliminate breeding sites for Aedes aegypti, but even so, the contagion data has gone up.\n\n\u201cThe servers do house checks every two months, but that needs to come from people too. You can't wait for the government to clean your yard \u201d, he says.\n\nSanta Catarina, although it has not yet had a significant increase in dengue cases in 2020, already projects a rise in the coming months. The number of outbreaks of the mosquito - when cities identify Aedes aegypti breeding sites - grew 54% until February 15, reaching more than 7,600 points. The latest epidemiological bulletin also points out that 100 of the 295 municipalities in Santa Catarina face an \u201cinfestation\u201d of Aedes aegypti.\n\n\u201cDue to the proximity to Paran\u00e1 and the circulation of tourists, we see a scenario of dengue growth,\u201d says Tharine Dal Cim, a biologist at the Santa Catarina Department of Health. \u201cWe have had hotter summers and less severe winters. Typically, the colder winter controls mosquito proliferation. But the milder temperatures, and the fact that Aedes is adapting to these conditions, have increased the focus on the State \u201d.\n\nFor the biologist, part of the South region is not yet used to facing dengue, as, in the population's imagination, colder states are free of the disease - high temperature is indeed an important factor in the proliferation of mosquitoes, but this does not shield the southern region of the country.\n\n\u201cPeople think that there is no dengue here, that it only affects the Southeast and Northeast. So, there is an oversight with the mosquito proliferation \u201d, says Dal Cim.\n\nSource: BBC Brasil",

So why has the United States been so slow in its attempt to develop reliable diagnostic tests and use them widely?\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has shipped testing kits to 57 countries. China had five commercial tests on the market 1 month ago and can now do up to 1.6 million tests a week; South Korea has tested 65,000 people so far. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in contrast, has done only 459 tests since the epidemic began. The rollout of a CDC-designed test kit to state and local labs has become a fiasco because it contained a faulty reagent. Labs around the country eager to test more suspected cases\u2014and test them faster\u2014have been unable to do so. No commercial or state labs have the approval to use their own tests.\n\nIn what is already an infamous snafu, CDC initially refused a request to test a patient in Northern California who turned out to be the first probable COVID19 case without known links to an infected person.\n...\nhttps://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020...y-soon-improve",

She add that, although the illnesses are still under investigation, they raise the level of concern for certain communities in the United States.\n  Jeffrey Duchin, MD, health officer with Public Health\u2013Seattle & King County, said that, of the three new cases reported by Washington today, none appear to be linked to travel and are considered presumed positives.\n  Two are related to LifeCare Center, a long-term care facility in Kirkland. One involves a female healthcare worker who is hospitalized in satisfactory condition at Overland Medical Center in Bellevue, and the other patient is a 70-year-old resident who is in serious condition at EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland.\n  Duchin said health officials are evaluating several other people with symptoms at the facility, including 27 of 108 residents and 25 of 180 staff. A CDC team is expected to arrive tonight to assist with the investigation.\n  The fatal case, which he said doesn't appear to be linked to the nursing home outbreak, involves a man in his 50s with underlying medical conditions who was hospitalized at EvergreenHealth Medical Center.\n  Notice of the three new cases in Washington state today follow announcements last night of two other cases of community transmission in the state, involving a high school boy and a woman who had traveled to South Korea. Combined with cases announced yesterday by California and Oregon, the United States now has seven community-transmission cases.\nWhite House officials unveil new response steps  At a White House media briefing, President Donald Trump and other federal officials expressed their condolences to the family of the Washington patient.\n  Trump said the country took aggressive early actions, and though more cases are likely, the risk to the nation is still low and infections are mild for most people. He also added that he will meet with pharmaceutical companies at the White House on Monday to discuss issues related to the development of drugs and vaccines.\n  Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the White House's COVID-19 task force, detailed new travel restrictions, similar to the temporary ban announced in late January on people coming from China. The new measures apply to all travelers coming from Iran, including other foreign nationals, and travelers coming from the most affected areas of Italy and South Korea.\n  He also said discussions are under way to step up medical screening in people in other affected countries who will be traveling to the United States. He added that the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response is taking steps to increase the availability of masks\u2014designed to provide 34 million more a month\u2014to protect healthcare workers.\n  Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said community spread now being reported in the United States will require a focus on state and local public health measures to identify and isolate cases and trace contacts. \"The country as a whole is still at low risk, but this is an evolving situation.\"\nCases outside China surge past 6,000  The CDC yesterday boosted travel warnings for Iran and Italy to the highest level, which urges people to avoid nonessential travel due to widespread community transmission and limited access to medical care.\n  In Iran, the health ministry reported 205 more cases and 9 more deaths, raising those respective totals to 595 and 43. Italy today reported 161 more cases and 8 more deaths, lifting its respective totals to 1,049 and 29.\n  The pace of new infections surged even higher in South Korea, with 813 more cases reported today, raising the country's total to 3,150. Four more people died from their infections, putting the fatality count at 17. In one of the daily updates today, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention detailed epidemiologic information on the first 16 deaths, all involving patients who had underlying medical conditions. The deaths occurred mainly in seniors, though 1 involved a patient in his 30s. Six were younger than 60, and 10 were male.\n  In Iran, the health ministry reported 205 more cases and 9 more deaths, raising those respective totals to 595 and 43.\n  Elsewhere in Asia, China reported 427 new cases, raising its overall total to 79,251, according to the National Health Commission daily update. It also reported 47 more deaths and 288 fewer serious cases, putting those respective totals at 2,835 and 7,664.\n  Japan reported 9 more cases, 4 of them from the hot spot in Hokkaido, for a total of 217, and Singapore reported 4 new infections, all linked to the same workplace cluster, raising its total to 102.\n  In other developments, two countries\u2014Canada and France\u2014reported cases imported from Egypt, though only one case has been reported in Egypt. The country's health ministry said it is in contact with Canada and France, following the detection of a case in a Canadian man who been in Egypt and two French travelers who apparently contracted the virus there, according to a media report that cited Egypt's health ministry.\n  At least three countries reported their first cases today: Qatar (Iran travel), Monaco, and Ecuador (Spain travel).\n  Several already affected countries reported new cases, including France, which announced a temporary ban on indoor gatherings of more than 5,000 people.\n  The World Health Organization said today in its latest daily situation report that over the past 24 hours it received 1,318 new reports of illnesses outside China, raising the total to 6,009 from 53 countries.",

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a statement last night that it was aware of four new presumed positive cases, which also includes a new travel-linked case in Washington.\n  All findings will undergo confirmation tests at the CDC, but the agency said state health officials will proceed with their investigations and response as if the cases were confirmed. It said the new confirmed cases bring the number detected by the US public health system to 19.\nCalifornia case detected in hospitalized patient  The new case in California was announced by Santa Clara County public health officials at a media briefing and involves an adult who was experiencing breathing problems and whose infectious disease physician reached out to county health officials for testing on Feb 26. The public health lab's testing confirmed the infection the next day, and county health officials immediately began tracing contacts.\n  Earlier in the day, the California Department of Public Health announced that test kits from the CDC now available in California can be used to do diagnostic testing in the community. It also said it expected another shipment of test kits to test as many as 1,200 people.\n  In a news release, Santa Clara Public Health said the COVID-19 case is its third and is not linked to the earlier two cases, which involved unrelated travelers who had both been in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began.\n  County officials said the community-transmission case announced last night involves an older woman who has chronic health conditions and was hospitalized for a respiratory illness. They added that the woman has no known exposure through travel or close contact with an infected person.\n  Sara Cody, MD, who directs the Santa Clara Public Health Department, said the new case indicates evidence of community transmission, but the extent isn't clear. \"I understand this may be concerning to hear, but this is what we have been preparing for. Now we need to start taking additional actions to slow down the spread of the disease.\"\n  In its statement, the county said the case is important, because it signals a change in course: Health officials will continue taking steps such as isolation, quarantine, and contact tracing to slow the spread of the disease, but a key priority is now community surveillance to gauge the extent of virus circulation.\nOregon officials trace school contacts  Shortly after Santa Clara County announced its case, Oregon Health Authority announced a presumed positive case involving a Washington County resident whose symptoms began on Feb 19 and who was tested yesterday. Oregon's state public health lab used the new COVID-19 test kit that it received on Feb 26 from the CDC. The positive result yesterday came just hours after the lab ran tests that were needed to validate the new CDC test kit.\n  The patient wasn't an earlier suspected case, didn't have a history of travel, and isn't a known contact of an earlier case. Investigators found that the patient had spent time in a school in Lake Oswego school district, where exposures to students and staff were possible. They are following up with employees and children's families to determine the next steps.\n  Meanwhile, the patient is in isolation and treatment at Kaiser Permanente Westside Medical Center in Hillsboro.\nHigh school student 1 of 2 Washington cases  Washington state health officials last night announced two presumptive positive cases, one community-acquired and the other in a woman who traveled a South Korea COVID-19 hot spot, the city of Daegu.\n  The community case involves a high school boy from Snohomish County who was sick earlier this week and visited Seattle Children's North Clinic on Feb 24. He had no travel history or connection to earlier cases. The student felt better and returned to school, but was placed on home isolation after tests were positive for COVID-19.\n  At a media briefing, health officials said the boy is doing well and is in home isolation and that a small number of students who were identified as close contacts are on 14-day quarantine. Jackson High School will be closed through Monday for deep cleaning.\n  Kathy Lofy, MD, state health officer, said in a statement, \"Now that we are able to expedite test results here at the Public Health Lab in Shoreline, we're getting results on suspected local cases a lot faster.\"\n  The second case involves a King County woman in her 50s who is in home isolation. At the media briefing, Jeffrey Duchin, MD, health officer with Public Health-Seattle and King County, said she traveled to South Korea between Feb 7 and Feb 23 and returned to work for 1 day, then stayed home when she started feeling sick. Her husband contacted health officials on Feb 26, who sent a team to test the woman in her home.\n  He said the woman's husband is well and is under quarantine, and he added that health officials expect to see more cases.",

Sounds of singing and dancing had been replaced by an unnatural, eerie silence. In Korea, authorities banned public gatherings and imposed a strict quarantine. Neighborhoods were put under curfew. In Odessa, as social order broke down people fell back on ancient rituals and superstitions.\n\nA pandemic was raging. Some evidence suggested it had begun in China, but its origins remained mysterious. Regardless, the infection had spread at breakneck pace. Outbreaks were reported from India to Ireland, Siberia to South Africa. Doctors appeared helpless to contain the virus\u2019s deadly progress.\n\nHospital wards were packed. The disease seemed to strike young and healthy adults with frightening virulence. Once infected, the unluckiest experienced a series of increasingly terrifying symptoms. Aches and chills developed into fever. Then inflammation kicked in, giving the face a dusky red complexion. Lungs bled and sufferers gasped for air, drowning in their own fluids. The lack of oxygen turned the skin blue, then black. After that, the end usually came quickly.\n\nThese are not accounts of the current Coronavirus epidemic, but of the 1918-1919 Spanish Flu that killed perhaps 50 million. The pandemic battered a world already reeling from WWI. While WWI may be better remembered, the Spanish Flu killed three times as many in one year as WWI did in four. As we confront another global health crisis, this \u201cforgotten pandemic\u201d offers essential lessons that could save millions today...",

Clifford Lane, M.D.,\nand Robert R. Redfield, M.D.\nArticle\n\nMetrics12 References\nThe latest threat to global health is the ongoing outbreak of the respiratory disease that was recently given the name Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19). Covid-19 was recognized in December 2019.1 It was rapidly shown to be caused by a novel coronavirus that is structurally related to the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). As in two preceding instances of emergence of coronavirus disease in the past 18 years2 \u2014 SARS (2002 and 2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (2012 to the present) \u2014 the Covid-19 outbreak has posed critical challenges for the public health, research, and medical communities.\n\nIn their Journal article, Li and colleagues3 provide a detailed clinical and epidemiologic description of the first 425 cases reported in the epicenter of the outbreak: the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. Although this information is critical in informing the appropriate response to this outbreak, as the authors point out, the study faces the limitation associated with reporting in real time the evolution of an emerging pathogen in its earliest stages. Nonetheless, a degree of clarity is emerging from this report. The median age of the patients was 59 years, with higher morbidity and mortality among the elderly and among those with coexisting conditions (similar to the situation with influenza); 56% of the patients were male. Of note, there were no cases in children younger than 15 years of age. Either children are less likely to become infected, which would have important epidemiologic implications, or their symptoms were so mild that their infection escaped detection, which has implications for the size of the denominator of total community infections.  Sign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\n On the basis of a case definition requiring a diagnosis of pneumonia, the currently reported case fatality rate is approximately 2%.4 In another article in the Journal, Guan et al.5 report mortality of 1.4% among 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19; these patients had a wide spectrum of disease severity. If one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%. This suggests that the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively.2\n\nThe efficiency of transmission for any respiratory virus has important implications for containment and mitigation strategies. The current study indicates an estimated basic reproduction number (R0) of 2.2, which means that, on average, each infected person spreads the infection to an additional two persons. As the authors note, until this number falls below 1.0, it is likely that the outbreak will continue to spread. Recent reports of high titers of virus in the oropharynx early in the course of disease arouse concern about increased infectivity during the period of minimal symptoms.6,7\n\nChina, the United States, and several other countries have instituted temporary restrictions on travel with an eye toward slowing the spread of this new disease within China and throughout the rest of the world. The United States has seen a dramatic reduction in the number of travelers from China, especially from Hubei province. At least on a temporary basis, such restrictions may have helped slow the spread of the virus: whereas 78,191 laboratory-confirmed cases had been identified in China as of February 26, 2020, a total of 2918 cases had been confirmed in 37 other countries or territories.4 As of February 26, 2020, there had been 14 cases detected in the United States involving travel to China or close contacts with travelers, 3 cases among U.S. citizens repatriated from China, and 42 cases among U.S. passengers repatriated from a cruise ship where the infection had spread.8 However, given the efficiency of transmission as indicated in the current report, we should be prepared for Covid-19 to gain a foothold throughout the world, including in the United States. Community spread in the United States could require a shift from containment to mitigation strategies such as social distancing in order to reduce transmission. Such strategies could include isolating ill persons (including voluntary isolation at home), school closures, and telecommuting where possible.9\n\nA robust research effort is currently under way to develop a vaccine against Covid-19.10 We anticipate that the first candidates will enter phase 1 trials by early spring. Therapy currently consists of supportive care while a variety of investigational approaches are being explored.11 Among these are the antiviral medication lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, interferon-1\u03b2, the RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, chloroquine, and a variety of traditional Chinese medicine products.11 Once available, intravenous hyperimmune globulin from recovered persons and monoclonal antibodies may be attractive candidates to study in early intervention. Critical to moving the field forward, even in the context of an outbreak, is ensuring that investigational products are evaluated in scientifically and ethically sound studies.12\n\nEvery outbreak provides an opportunity to gain important information, some of which is associated with a limited window of opportunity. For example, Li et al. report a mean interval of 9.1 to 12.5 days between the onset of illness and hospitalization. This finding of a delay in the progression to serious disease may be telling us something important about the pathogenesis of this new virus and may provide a unique window of opportunity for intervention. Achieving a better understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease will be invaluable in navigating our responses in this uncharted arena. Furthermore, genomic studies could delineate host factors that predispose persons to acquisition of infection and disease progression.\n\nThe Covid-19 outbreak is a stark reminder of the ongoing challenge of emerging and reemerging infectious pathogens and the need for constant surveillance, prompt diagnosis, and robust research to understand the basic biology of new organisms and our susceptibilities to them, as well as to develop effective countermeasures.Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this editorial at NEJM.org.\n\nThis editorial was published on February 28, 2020, at NEJM.org.Author AffiliationsFrom the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (A.S.F., H.C.L.); and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta (R.R.R.).\n\n...\n\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.105...elated_article",

METHODSWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTSThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission. CONCLUSIONSDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness. Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings. (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.)In early December 2019, the first pneumonia cases of unknown origin were identified in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province.1 The pathogen has been identified as a novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus2 that has currently been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has a phylogenetic similarity to SARS-CoV.3 Patients with the infection have been documented both in hospitals and in family settings.4-8\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) a public health emergency of international concern.9 As of February 25, 2020, a total of 81,109 laboratory-confirmed cases had been documented globally.5,6,9-11 In recent studies, the severity of some cases of Covid-19 mimicked that of SARS-CoV.1,12,13Given the rapid spread of Covid-19, we determined that an updated analysis of cases throughout China might help identify the defining clinical characteristics and severity of the disease. Here, we describe the results of our analysis of the clinical characteristics of Covid-19 in a selected cohort of patients throughout China.Methods STUDY OVERSIGHTThe study was supported by National Health Commission of China and designed by the investigators. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the National Health Commission. Written informed consent was waived in light of the urgent need to collect data. Data were analyzed and interpreted by the authors. All the authors reviewed the manuscript and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the adherence of the study to the protocol, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.  DATA SOURCESWe obtained the medical records and compiled data for hospitalized patients and outpatients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19, as reported to the National Health Commission between December 11, 2019, and January 29, 2020; the data cutoff for the study was January 31, 2020. Covid-19 was diagnosed on the basis of the WHO interim guidance.14 A confirmed case of Covid-19 was defined as a positive result on high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens.1 Only laboratory-confirmed cases were included in the analysis.\n\nWe obtained data regarding cases outside Hubei province from the National Health Commission. Because of the high workload of clinicians, three outside experts from Guangzhou performed raw data extraction at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, where many of the patients with Covid-19 in Wuhan were being treated.\n\nWe extracted the recent exposure history, clinical symptoms or signs, and laboratory findings on admission from electronic medical records. Radiologic assessments included chest radiography or computed tomography (CT), and all laboratory testing was performed according to the clinical care needs of the patient. We determined the presence of a radiologic abnormality on the basis of the documentation or description in medical charts; if imaging scans were available, they were reviewed by attending physicians in respiratory medicine who extracted the data. Major disagreement between two reviewers was resolved by consultation with a third reviewer. Laboratory assessments consisted of a complete blood count, blood chemical analysis, coagulation testing, assessment of liver and renal function, and measures of electrolytes, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. We defined the degree of severity of Covid-19 (severe vs. nonsevere) at the time of admission using the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia.15\n\nAll medical records were copied and sent to the data-processing center in Guangzhou, under the coordination of the National Health Commission. A team of experienced respiratory clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data. Data were entered into a computerized database and cross-checked. If the core data were missing, requests for clarification were sent to the coordinators, who subsequently contacted the attending clinicians. STUDY OUTCOMESThe primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. These outcomes were used in a previous study to assess the severity of other serious infectious diseases, such as H7N9 infection.16Secondary end points were the rate of death and the time from symptom onset until the composite end point and until each component of the composite end point.  STUDY DEFINITIONSThe incubation period was defined as the interval between the potential earliest date of contact of the transmission source (wildlife or person with suspected or confirmed case) and the potential earliest date of symptom onset (i.e., cough, fever, fatigue, or myalgia). We excluded incubation periods of less than 1 day because some patients had continuous exposure to contamination sources; in these cases, the latest date of exposure was recorded. The summary statistics of incubation periods were calculated on the basis of 291 patients who had clear information regarding the specific date of exposure.\n\nFever was defined as an axillary temperature of 37.5\u00b0C or higher. Lymphocytopenia was defined as a lymphocyte count of less than 1500 cells per cubic millimeter. Thrombocytopenia was defined as a platelet count of less than 150,000 per cubic millimeter. Additional definitions \u2014 including exposure to wildlife, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, acute kidney failure, acute heart failure, and rhabdomyolysis \u2014 are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.  LABORATORY CONFIRMATIONLaboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 was performed at the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control before January 23, 2020, and subsequently in certified tertiary care hospitals. RT-PCR assays were performed in accordance with the protocol established by the WHO.17 Details regarding laboratory confirmation processes are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.  STATISTICAL ANALYSISContinuous variables were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges or simple ranges, as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages. No imputation was made for missing data. Because the cohort of patients in our study was not derived from random selection, all statistics are deemed to be descriptive only. We used ArcGIS, version 10.2.2, to plot the numbers of patients with reportedly confirmed cases on a map. All the analyses were performed with the use of R software, version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).Results DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS Figure 1.Distribution of Patients with Covid-19 across China.\n\nOf the 7736 patients with Covid-19 who had been hospitalized at 552 sites as of January 29, 2020, we obtained data regarding clinical symptoms and outcomes for 1099 patients (14.2%). The largest number of patients (132) had been admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. The hospitals that were included in this study accounted for 29.7% of the 1856 designated hospitals where patients with Covid-19 could be admitted in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, or municipalities across China (Figure 1).\n\nTable 1.Clinical Characteristics of the Study Patients, According to Disease Severity and the Presence or Absence of the Primary Composite End Point.\n\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. A total of 3.5% were health care workers, and a history of contact with wildlife was documented in 1.9%; 483 patients (43.9%) were residents of Wuhan. Among the patients who lived outside Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city; 25.9% of nonresidents had neither visited the city nor had contact with Wuhan residents.\n\nThe median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). The median age of the patients was 47 years (interquartile range, 35 to 58); 0.9% of the patients were younger than 15 years of age. A total of 41.9% were female. Fever was present in 43.8% of the patients on admission but developed in 88.7% during hospitalization. The second most common symptom was cough (67.8%); nausea or vomiting (5.0%) and diarrhea (3.8%) were uncommon. Among the overall population, 23.7% had at least one coexisting illness (e.g., hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).\n\nOn admission, the degree of severity of Covid-19 was categorized as nonsevere in 926 patients and severe in 173 patients. Patients with severe disease were older than those with nonsevere disease by a median of 7 years. Moreover, the presence of any coexisting illness was more common among patients with severe disease than among those with nonsevere disease (38.7% vs. 21.0%). However, the exposure history between the two groups of disease severity was similar. RADIOLOGIC AND LABORATORY FINDINGS Table 2.Radiographic and Laboratory Findings.\n\nTable 2 shows the radiologic and laboratory findings on admission. Of 975 CT scans that were performed at the time of admission, 86.2% revealed abnormal results. The most common patterns on chest CT were ground-glass opacity (56.4%) and bilateral patchy shadowing (51.8%). Representative radiologic findings in two patients with nonsevere Covid-19 and in another two patients with severe Covid-19 are provided in Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\nOn admission, lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients, thrombocytopenia in 36.2%, and leukopenia in 33.7%. Most of the patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein; less common were elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and d-dimer. Patients with severe disease had more prominent laboratory abnormalities (including lymphocytopenia and leukopenia) than those with nonsevere disease. CLINICAL OUTCOMES Table 3.Complications, Treatments, and Clinical Outcomes.\n\nNone of the 1099 patients were lost to follow-up during the study. A primary composite end-point event occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died (Table 3). Among the 173 patients with severe disease, a primary composite end-point event occurred in 43 patients (24.9%). Among all the patients, the cumulative risk of the composite end point was 3.6%; among those with severe disease, the cumulative risk was 20.6%.  TREATMENT AND COMPLICATIONSA majority of the patients (58.0%) received intravenous antibiotic therapy, and 35.8% received oseltamivir therapy; oxygen therapy was administered in 41.3% and mechanical ventilation in 6.1%; higher percentages of patients with severe disease received these therapies (Table 3). Mechanical ventilation was initiated in more patients with severe disease than in those with nonsevere disease (noninvasive ventilation, 32.4% vs. 0%; invasive ventilation, 14.5% vs. 0%). Systemic glucocorticoids were given to 204 patients (18.6%), with a higher percentage among those with severe disease than nonsevere disease (44.5% vs. 13.7%). Of these 204 patients, 33 (16.2%) were admitted to the ICU, 17 (8.3%) underwent invasive ventilation, and 5 (2.5%) died. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed in 5 patients (0.5%) with severe disease.\n\nThe median duration of hospitalization was 12.0 days (mean, 12.8). During hospital admission, most of the patients received a diagnosis of pneumonia from a physician (91.1%), followed by ARDS (3.4%) and shock (1.1%). Patients with severe disease had a higher incidence of physician-diagnosed pneumonia than those with nonsevere disease (99.4% vs. 89.5%).DiscussionDuring the initial phase of the Covid-19 outbreak, the diagnosis of the disease was complicated by the diversity in symptoms and imaging findings and in the severity of disease at the time of presentation. Fever was identified in 43.8% of the patients on presentation but developed in 88.7% after hospitalization. Severe illness occurred in 15.7% of the patients after admission to a hospital. No radiologic abnormalities were noted on initial presentation in 2.9% of the patients with severe disease and in 17.9% of those with nonsevere disease. Despite the number of deaths associated with Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2 appears to have a lower case fatality rate than either SARS-CoV or Middle East respiratory syndrome\u2013related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Compromised respiratory status on admission (the primary driver of disease severity) was associated with worse outcomes.\n\nApproximately 2% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife, whereas more than three quarters were either residents of Wuhan, had visited the city, or had contact with city residents. These findings echo the latest reports, including the outbreak of a family cluster,4 transmission from an asymptomatic patient,6 and the three-phase outbreak patterns.8 Our study cannot preclude the presence of patients who have been termed \u201csuper-spreaders.\u201d\n\nConventional routes of transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and highly pathogenic influenza consist of respiratory droplets and direct contact,18-20 mechanisms that probably occur with SARS-CoV-2 as well. Because SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the gastrointestinal tract, saliva, and urine, these routes of potential transmission need to be investigated21 (Tables S1 and S2).\n\nThe term Covid-19 has been applied to patients who have laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases without apparent radiologic manifestations. A better understanding of the spectrum of the disease is needed, since in 8.9% of the patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected before the development of viral pneumonia or viral pneumonia did not develop.\n\nIn concert with recent studies,1,8,12 we found that the clinical characteristics of Covid-19 mimic those of SARS-CoV. Fever and cough were the dominant symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms were uncommon, which suggests a difference in viral tropism as compared with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and seasonal influenza.22,23 The absence of fever in Covid-19 is more frequent than in SARS-CoV (1%) and MERS-CoV infection (2%),20 so afebrile patients may be missed if the surveillance case definition focuses on fever detection.14 Lymphocytopenia was common and, in some cases, severe, a finding that was consistent with the results of two recent reports.1,12 We found a lower case fatality rate (1.4%) than the rate that was recently reportedly,1,12 probably because of the difference in sample sizes and case inclusion criteria. Our findings were more similar to the national official statistics, which showed a rate of death of 3.2% among 51,857 cases of Covid-19 as of February 16, 2020.11,24 Since patients who were mildly ill and who did not seek medical attention were not included in our study, the case fatality rate in a real-world scenario might be even lower. Early isolation, early diagnosis, and early management might have collectively contributed to the reduction in mortality in Guangdong.\n\nDespite the phylogenetic homogeneity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, there are some clinical characteristics that differentiate Covid-19 from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and seasonal influenza infections. (For example, seasonal influenza has been more common in respiratory outpatient clinics and wards.) Some additional characteristics that are unique to Covid-19 are detailed in Table S3.\n\nOur study has some notable limitations. First, some cases had incomplete documentation of the exposure history and laboratory testing, given the variation in the structure of electronic databases among different participating sites and the urgent timeline for data extraction. Some cases were diagnosed in outpatient settings where medical information was briefly documented and incomplete laboratory testing was performed, along with a shortage of infrastructure and training of medical staff in nonspecialty hospitals. Second, we could estimate the incubation period in only 291 of the study patients who had documented information. The uncertainty of the exact dates (recall bias) might have inevitably affected our assessment. Third, because many patients remained in the hospital and the outcomes were unknown at the time of data cutoff, we censored the data regarding their clinical outcomes as of the time of our analysis. Fourth, we no doubt missed patients who were asymptomatic or had mild cases and who were treated at home, so our study cohort may represent the more severe end of Covid-19. Fifth, many patients did not undergo sputum bacteriologic or fungal assessment on admission because, in some hospitals, medical resources were overwhelmed. Sixth, data generation was clinically driven and not systematic.\n\nCovid-19 has spread rapidly since it was first identified in Wuhan and has been shown to have a wide spectrum of severity. Some patients with Covid-19 do not have fever or radiologic abnormalities on initial presentation, which has complicated the diagnosis.Supported by the National Health Commission of China, the National Natural Science Foundation, and the Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province.\n\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\nDrs.

This is the eighth case in Ontario. Ontario's first three cases are all resolved, with each of those patients having two consecutive negative tests at least 24 hours apart.\n\nAfter arriving in Toronto on February 20, 2020, a man in his 80s presented himself at Scarborough Health Network's General Hospital's emergency department on February 27, 2020, with a travel history to Egypt. As per established infection prevention and control protocols, the patient was cared for at the hospital using all appropriate precautions, including being isolated as he was tested for COVID-19. The man was discharged home the same day feeling well and, per protocols, went into self-isolation where he remains.\n\n\n\nThroughout his travels, the man wore a mask. Toronto Public Health is actively engaged in contact tracing and case management.\n\nAt this time the virus is not circulating locally, however given the global circumstances, Ontario is actively working with city and health partners to plan for the potential of local spread. The province continues to carefully monitor this situation and encourage residents to stay informed by regularly reviewing credible information sources.\n\nDr. Williams will provide an update on the situation at the regularly scheduled media briefing on Monday, March 2, 2020 at 3:00 p.m. at the Queen's Park media studio.\n\nVisit Ontario's website to learn more about how the province continues to protect Ontarians from COVID-19.",

We now see more cases outside of China than inside, and we\u2019re also hearing of cases inside the U.S. among people without known travel contact. One critical lesson from our experience with H1N1 a decade ago is worth highlighting: We must integrate our nation\u2019s 5,000 jails, prisons and immigration detention centers with our pandemic response efforts.\n\nIn the spring of 2009, we also faced a novel viral threat to health in the form of H1N1, which the CDC now estimates took between approximately 150,000 and 500,000 lives worldwide in the first 12 months of activity. Much of this illness occurred among young people, who lacked antibodies for this strain of flu. Working inside the health service of the New York City jail system, we confronted a wide array of issues in responding to H1N1, from decisions about how to set up surveillance for influenza-like illness, to diagnosis and treatment of suspected cases and isolation of housing areas of the jails where people were ill...",

Malani, MD, MSJ2,3\nAuthor Affiliations Article Information\nJAMA.

As of February 27, 2020, more than 82\u202f000 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) and 2800 deaths have been reported, of which approximately 95% of cases and 97% of deaths are in China.1 Cases have now been reported in 49 other countries. A particularly large outbreak occurred among the passengers and crew of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where more than 700 infections are reported.\n\nThe data surrounding the biology, epidemiology, and clinical characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been growing daily, with more than 400 articles listed in PubMed. The virus genome was rapidly sequenced, which allowed the development of diagnostic tests and for research into vaccine and therapeutics to start. Meanwhile, the clinical spectrum of disease continues to be defined (including the potential for asymptomatic spread) and clinical trials evaluating treatments have begun. This Viewpoint updates previous guidance for clinicians2 and summarizes what is known, what is unknown, and what are the next steps based on available evidence to address and halt the outbreak.\nThe Virus\n\nNamed 2019-nCoV by the WHO and SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, this virus is a new human-infecting Betacoronavirus that, based on its genetic proximity to 2 bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses, likely originated in chrysanthemum bats. The virus uses a densely glycosylated spike (S) protein to enter host cells and binds with high affinity to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in humans in a manner similar to SARS-CoV. However, monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV do not exhibit much binding to SARS-CoV-2, confirming that this is a new virus. The ACE2 enzyme is expressed in type II alveolar cells, and some unconfirmed data suggest that Asian males have a large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung, which may partially explain the male predominance of COVID-19. However, other factors such as a higher prevalence of smoking among men in China may explain the difference in the sex distribution of the disease.\n\nThere is likely an intermediate host between bats and humans, and preliminary data suggest it is the pangolin (a scaly anteater), an endangered and commonly trafficked mammal in which recombination of the bat and pangolin coronaviruses could have occurred. Many questions remain that have clinical and public health implications, such as how this virus emerged, why it is more easily transmissible than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, and what are the best targets for vaccines and therapeutics?\n\nEpidemiology\n\nCurrent estimates of the incubation period range from 1 to 14 days with a median of 5 to 6 days, although recent case reports suggest that the incubation period may be as long as 24 days,3 which is longer than the 14 days that WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been using to inform quarantine policies. A potentially longer incubation period has important implications for quarantine policies and prevention of spread. The virus appears to be transmitted primarily through large droplets, but it has also been found in stool and blood, raising questions about other potential modes of transmission.4 If confirmed that the virus can be spread by stool, then different types of precautions may be necessary. As with other coronaviruses, health care\u2013associated transmission appears to be a major mode of infection, with one study suggesting that 41% of 138 cases were presumed to have been health care acquired.5\n\nThe reproductive number (R0) (the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single infected person in a susceptible population) for SARS-CoV-2, although still preliminary, is estimated between 2 and 3, suggesting a higher pandemic potential than SARS. Transmission from an asymptomatic carrier appears to be possible,3,4 which, if confirmed in larger studies, will have important implications for screening and isolation. A report of 9 pregnant patients suggests that perinatal transmission is unlikely but larger studies are needed to confirm this finding.6 An unanswered question is how many infections have occurred in and outside of China that have not been counted. Using air travel data, one estimate suggests that approximately two-thirds of COVID-19 cases exported from mainland China have remained undetected.7\n\nClinical Characteristics\n\nPublished studies of hospitalized patients, mostly in Wuhan, China, have suggested that the median age is in the 50s, with a slight predominance of men; approximately 25% of patients have a severe course requiring intensive care, and approximately 10% required mechanical ventilation.1,5 However, other studies suggest a more benign course in younger adults and children, especially outside Wuhan.8 In general, the clinical presentation has involved fever in 83% to 98% of patients, dry cough in 76% to 82%, and fatigue or myalgias in 11% to 44%. Other symptoms have been reported, such as headache, sore throat, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Abnormal laboratory findings have included lymphopenia (70%), prolonged prothrombin time (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (40%). Chest radiographs are characterized by bilateral patchy infiltrates and chest CT scans demonstrate ground-glass infiltrates.\n\nThere are few data available on histopathological findings, but one study of a patient who died indicated the presence of hyaline membrane formation, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, and multinucleated giant cells, findings not dissimilar from those in SARS or MERS. Currently, it appears that most patients have a mild illness. However, from a clinical standpoint it is essential to more fully define the spectrum of disease, from asymptomatic to severe, and the risk factors for disease progression and mortality.\n\nCase-Fatality Rate\n\nLike the clinical manifestations, the case-fatality rate (CFR) appears to be highly variable. Early reports suggested that it could be as high as 8% to 15% in older adults infected in Hubei Province. The CFR is increased in adults with comorbid conditions who developed severe respiratory symptoms. The CFR outside of Hubei, although based on limited data, is much lower, likely no higher than 1% to 2%, although this will depend on accurate detection of those with mild disease.1\n\nScreening and Testing\n\nBoth the WHO and CDC recommend screening based on travel to China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with a person diagnosed or under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 in the past 14 days with fever and/or respiratory symptoms. However, given the increasing number of cases in other countries such as South Korea, Italy, and Japan, and the recent report of a case in California with no history of travel or known contact with someone who traveled, will likely soon lead to changes in screening recommendations.\n\nAt present, testing capabilities remain limited. CDC has published primers, probes, and protocols, but there have been issues with the test kits and performance that have prevented scaling up of testing beyond a few public health laboratories. According to data published on the CDC coronavirus site, fewer than 500 tests have been conducted in the US. Developing robust testing capabilities is an unmet need in confronting this outbreak and essential for identification of those with infection and minimal symptoms.\n\nIf a clinician identifies a potential case (ie, a person under investigation for COVID-19), current recommendations from CDC are that the clinical laboratory the clinician will use for testing should contact the local public health laboratory to coordinate testing. It is recommended that the specimen submitted for reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing be a nasopharyngeal and not a throat swab and, ideally, a lower respiratory tract sample such as induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage. Serum samples can also be sent. Viral cultures are not recommended. Additional tests, such as complete blood cell count and routine microbiology, including molecular testing for other respiratory viruses, can be handled using universal precautions in hospital laboratories.\n\nClinical Care and Treatment\n\nThe care of the patient with COVID-19 is similar to that of other viral pneumonias, primarily consisting of supportive care and oxygen supplementation when needed. Corticosteroids have not been recommended. Anecdotal evidence suggests that remdesivir, a nucleoside prodrug that is thought to act by inhibiting viral RNA transcription, may be useful and clinical trials are under way. Additionally, lopinavir/ritonavir has also been tried based on efficacy in animal models of MERS-CoV, but this may not be the case in humans with COVID-19. Recently China approved the use of favilavir, an antiviral drug used for influenza, as investigational therapy for COVID-19. In total, more than 100 clinical trials are currently under way to test novel and repurposed compounds against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nPrevention and Infection Control\n\nNo vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is currently available. More than 11 vaccine candidates are in development and a phase 1 study of an mRNA vaccine developed by the NIH is expected to begin in March 2020. Because health care\u2013associated transmission and infection of health care workers is a major problem, the CDC recommends that health care workers use personal protective equipment (PPE) and implement standard, contact, and airborne precautions including the use of eye protection. Health care workers should wear a gown, gloves, and either an N95 respirator plus a face shield or goggles or a powered, air-purifying respirator. There are many challenges in the infection prevention arena including the presence of clinically mild cases or atypical presentations and limited supply of PPE or respiratory isolation rooms at most hospitals.\n\nThe current outbreak has prompted a debate about the effectiveness of quarantines both in China and other countries. It appears that the strict measures China took may have \u201cbought the world some time\u201d but did not prevent the global dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, quarantines like the one imposed on passengers and crew of the Diamond Princess increased transmission and resulted in hundreds of infections. When executed properly, quarantines can reduce transmission but human rights must be respected, and in an age of global connectivity it may be difficult if not impossible to implement effective quarantine measures.\n\nThe rapid progress that science and public health have made in confronting the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is unparalleled, yet there is still a pressing need to accelerate protocols that lead to the discovery and implementation of rapid point-of-care diagnostic testing, effective antiviral therapies, and eventually, a safe and immunogenic vaccine.\n\nBack to top\nArticle Information\n\nCorresponding Author: Carlos del Rio, MD, Emory University School of Medicine, 49 Jesse Hill Jr Dr, FOB Room 201, Atlanta, GA 30303 (cdelrio@emory.edu).\n\nPublished Online: February 28, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.3072\n\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Del Rio reports receiving grants from NIAID.

The virus in urine also poses a challenge to China's sewer system amid the epidemic outbreak.\n\nThe latest finding by top epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan's team sheds light on the transmission and prevention of the epidemic, another breakthrough after scientists found isolated novel coronavirus strains from samples of infected patients' feces.\n\nStrains isolated from feces and urine pose a threat to China's sewer system, especially in hospitals, where swarms of patients are admitted. If the patients' feces and urine are not handled properly, it can contaminate the air and transmit through aerosols, Yang Zhanqiu, the deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University warned.\n\n\"But we don't have to overreact to it. No need to disinfect the sewage systems in the whole city, as large amount of disinfectant may cause long-term water pollution,\" Yang told the Global Times Saturday.\n\nBesides feces, the detection of strains in urine possibly means the virus could flow with the blood in the body and harm multiple organs; not only lungs but kidneys and heart, Yang said.\n\nTransmissions through respiratory routes and contact, however, remain the major sources of the novel coronavirus contagion, experts said.\n\nZhong has stressed the importance of city sewer systems in the fight against the coronavirus, citing the case of Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong during the SARS crisis in 2003.",

Characteristics of and Public Health Responses to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak in China.Deng SQ1, Peng HJ1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   In December 2019, cases of unidentified pneumonia with a history of exposure in the Huanan Seafood Market were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province. A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified to be accountable for this disease. Human-to-human transmission is confirmed, and this disease (named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO)) spread rapidly around the country and the world. As of 18 February 2020, the number of confirmed cases had reached 75,199 with 2009 fatalities. The COVID-19 resulted in a much lower case-fatality rate (about 2.67%) among the confirmed cases, compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Among the symptom composition of the 45 fatality cases collected from the released official reports, the top four are fever, cough, short of breath, and chest tightness/pain. The major comorbidities of the fatality cases include hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction, and chronic bronchitis. The source of the virus and the pathogenesis of this disease are still unconfirmed. No specific therapeutic drug has been found. The Chinese Government has initiated a level-1 public health response to prevent the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, it is also crucial to speed up the development of vaccines and drugs for treatment, which will enable us to defeat COVID-19 as soon as possible.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  2019-nCoV; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; clinical characteristics; coronavirus; diagnosis; pneumonia; prevention and control; public health; treatment\n\n PMID: \t32093211 \tDOI: \t10.3390/jcm9020575 \n  Free full text",

[Epub ahead of print]  The antiviral compound remdesivir potently inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.Gordon CJ1, Tchesnokov EP1, Feng JY2, Porter DP3, Gotte M4.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Antiviral drugs for managing infections with human coronaviruses are not yet approved, posing a serious challenge to current global efforts aimed at containing the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Remdesivir (RDV) is an investigational compound with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). RDV is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Here, we co-expressed the MERS-CoV nonstructural proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 (RdRp) in insect cells as a part a polyprotein to study the mechanism of inhibition of MERS-CoV RdRp by RDV. We initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The triphosphate form of the inhibitor (RDV-TP) competes with its natural counterpart ATP. Of note, the selectivity value for RDV-TP obtained here with a steady-state approach suggests that it is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other nucleotide analogues. Once incorporated at position i, the inhibitor caused RNA synthesis arrest at position i+3. Hence, the likely mechanism of action is delayed RNA chain termination. The additional three nucleotides may protect the inhibitor from excision by the viral 3'-5' exonuclease activity. Together, these results help to explain the high potency of RDV against RNA viruses in cell-based assays.\n  Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Ebola virus (EBOV); Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2; RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), viral replicase; coronavirus, positive-sense RNA virus; drug development; enzyme inhibitor; nucleoside/nucleotide analogue; plus-stranded RNA virus; remdesivir, antiviral drug, RNA chain-termination; viral polymerase\n\n PMID: \t32094225 \tDOI: \t10.1074/jbc.AC120.013056 \n  Free full text",

[Epub ahead of print]  Functional assessment of cell entry and receptor usage for SARS-CoV-2 and other lineage B betacoronaviruses.Letko M1, Marzi A2, Munster V3.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Over the past 20\u2009years, several coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier into humans, causing outbreaks of severe, and often fatal, respiratory illness. Since SARS-CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\n PMID: \t32094589 \tDOI: \t10.1038/s41564-020-0688-y",

[Epub ahead of print]  2019 novel coronavirus infection and gastrointestinal tract.Gao QY1, Chen YX1, Fang JY1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Since end of December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown origin was reported from Wuhan, Hubei province, China. As of Feb 17th, 2020, statistical data show that the outbreak constitutes an epidemic threat in China, where the exponential increase in patients has reached 75114 confirmed cases, with 2239 deaths. Different from SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) infection, the initial presentations or the chief complain of some patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) were gastrointestinal symptoms. So we call upon all the first-line medical staff to be cautious and pay more attention to those untypical patients especially from the epidemic area. Besides, as the viral nucleic acids could be found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients with COVID-19 infection, the possibility of fecal-oral transmission need to be took into account. Based on the previously and recently studies, we speculate that COVID-19 may have some relationship with the gut microbiota through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, thus targeting gut microbiota might be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of virus-related pneumonia.

It is of crucial importance to estimate the reproductive number (R0) of the novel virus in the early stage of outbreak and make a prediction of daily new cases on the ship.\nMETHOD:  We fitted the reported serial interval (Mean and standard deviation) with a gamma distribution and applied \"earlyR\" package in R to estimate the R0 in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. We applied \"projections\" package in R to simulate the plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories and future daily incidence by fitting the data of existing daily incidence, a serial interval distribution, and the estimated R0 into a model based on the assumption that daily incidence obeys approximately Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness.\nRESULTS:  The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.28 for COVID-19 outbreak at early stage on the ship. The median with 95% confidence interval (CI) of R0 values was 2.28 (2.06-2.52) estimated by the bootstrap resampling method. The probable number of new cases for the next ten days would gradually increase, and the estimated cumulative cases would reach 1514 (1384-1656) at the tenth day in the future. However, if R0 value was reduced by 25% and 50%, the estimated total number of cumulative cases would be reduced to 1081 (981-1177) and 758 (697-817), respectively.\nCONCLUSION:  The median with 95% CI of R0 of COVID-19 was about 2.28 (2.06-2.52) during the early stage experienced on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The future daily incidence and probable outbreak size is largely dependent on the change of R0. Unless strict infection management and control are taken, our findings indicate the potential of COVID-19 to cause greater outbreak on the ship.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020.

However, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk. First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. Second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. Third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from COVID-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that can address the abovementioned three problems. Although COVID-19 involves mostly mild infections among the majority of the general population, the risk of death among young adults is higher than that of seasonal influenza, and elderly with underlying comorbidities require additional care.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  emerging infectious diseases; fatality; statistical estimation; virulence; virus\n\n PMID: \t32098019 \tDOI: \t10.3390/jcm9020580",

Limited epidemiological data are available, and recent changes in case definition and reporting further complicate our understanding of the impact of the epidemic, particularly in the epidemic's epicenter. Here we use previously validated phenomenological models to generate short-term forecasts of cumulative reported cases in Guangdong and Zhejiang, China. Using daily reported cumulative case data up until 13 February 2020 from the National Health Commission of China, we report 5- and 10-day ahead forecasts of cumulative case reports. Specifically, we generate forecasts using a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model, which have each been previously used to forecast outbreaks due to different infectious diseases. Forecasts from each of the models suggest the outbreaks may be nearing extinction in both Guangdong and Zhejiang; however, the sub-epidemic model predictions also include the potential for further sustained transmission, particularly in Zhejiang. Our 10-day forecasts across the three models predict an additional 65-81 cases (upper bounds: 169-507) in Guangdong and an additional 44-354 (upper bounds: 141-875) cases in Zhejiang by February 23, 2020. In the best-case scenario, current data suggest that transmission in both provinces is slowing down.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  COVID-19; China; coronavirus; phenomenological models; real-time forecasts; sub-epidemic model\n\n PMID: \t32098289 \tDOI: \t10.3390/jcm9020596",

Emergence of Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV: Need for Rapid Vaccine and Biologics Development.Shanmugaraj B1,2, Malla A1,2, Phoolcharoen W1,2.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen that was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. This virus is responsible for the ongoing outbreak that causes severe respiratory illness and pneumonia-like infection in humans. Due to the increasing number of cases in China and outside China, the WHO declared coronavirus as a global health emergency. Nearly 35,000 cases were reported and at least 24 other countries or territories have reported coronavirus cases as early on as February. Inter-human transmission was reported in a few countries, including the United States. Neither an effective anti-viral nor a vaccine is currently available to treat this infection. As the virus is a newly emerging pathogen, many questions remain unanswered regarding the virus's reservoirs, pathogenesis, transmissibility, and much more is unknown. The collaborative efforts of researchers are needed to fill the knowledge gaps about this new virus, to develop the proper diagnostic tools, and effective treatment to combat this infection. Recent advancements in plant biotechnology proved that plants have the ability to produce vaccines or biopharmaceuticals rapidly in a short time. In this review, the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China, the need for rapid vaccine development, and the potential of a plant system for biopharmaceutical development are discussed.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  biopharmaceuticals; coronavirus; emerging threat; infectious diseases; plant system; transient expression; viruses; zoonoses\n\n PMID: \t32098302 \tDOI: \t10.3390/pathogens9020148",

Systematic Comparison of Two Animal-to-Human Transmitted Human Coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.Xu J1, Zhao S1, Teng T1, Abdalla AE2, Zhu W3, Xie L1, Wang Y4, Guo X1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   After the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the world in 2003, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported as pathogens that cause severe symptoms in respiratory tract infections. Recently, a new emerged HCoV isolated from the respiratory epithelium of unexplained pneumonia patients in the Wuhan seafood market caused a major disease outbreak and has been named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus causes acute lung symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as \"coronavirus disease 2019\" (COVID-19). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and of SARS-CoV caused widespread fear and concern and has threatened global health security. There are some similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features between these two viruses and diseases that are caused by these viruses. The goal of this work is to systematically review and compare between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and treatment methods, genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2; clinical manifestations; coronaviruses; genomic comparison; pathogenic mechanism; proteomic comparison\n\n PMID: \t32098422 \tDOI: \t10.3390/v12020244",

An updated estimation of the risk of transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov).Tang B1,2, Bragazzi NL2, Li Q2,3, Tang S4, Xiao Y1,3, Wu J1,2,5.\nAuthor informationAbstract   The basic reproduction number of an infectious agent is the average number of infections one case can generate over the course of the infectious period, in a na\u00efve, uninfected population. It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised. By using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th, 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak. Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation. The epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.\n  \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

We analyzed the radiographic and CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia at baseline. Fisher's exact test was used to compare CT findings depending on the shape of pulmonary lesions.\nRESULTS:  Three of the nine patients (33.3%) had parenchymal abnormalities detected by chest radiography, and most of the abnormalities were peripheral consolidations. Chest CT images showed bilateral involvement in eight of the nine patients, and a unilobar reversed halo sign in the other patient. In total, 77 pulmonary lesions were found, including patchy lesions (39%), large confluent lesions (13%), and small nodular lesions (48%). The peripheral and posterior lung fields were involved in 78% and 67% of the lesions, respectively. The lesions were typically ill-defined and were composed of mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation or pure ground-glass opacities. Patchy to confluent lesions were primarily distributed in the lower lobes (p = 0.040) and along the pleura (p < 0.001), whereas nodular lesions were primarily distributed along the bronchovascular bundles (p = 0.006).\nCONCLUSION:  COVID-19 pneumonia in Korea primarily manifested as pure to mixed ground-glass opacities with a patchy to confluent or nodular shape in the bilateral peripheral posterior lungs. A considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had normal chest radiographs.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Korean Society of Radiology.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  COVID-19; Chest X-ray; Computed tomography; Coronavirus; Pneumonia\n\n PMID: \t32100485 \tDOI: \t10.3348/kjr.2020.0132",

Passengers' destinations from China: low risk of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) transmission into Africa and South America.Haider N1, Yavlinsky A2, Simons D1, Osman AY1, Ntoumi F3,4, Zumla A5,6, Kock R1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV [SARS-COV-2]) was detected in humans during the last week of December 2019 at Wuhan city in China, and caused 24 554 cases in 27 countries and territories as of 5 February 2020. The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-nCoV through human passenger air flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated passengers' end destination data for the period of 1-31 January 2020 from FLIRT, an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of 2019-nCoV transmission based on the number of travellers to destination countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We ranked each country based on the risk index in four quantiles (4th quantile being the highest risk and 1st quantile being the lowest risk). During the period, 388 287 passengers were destined for 1297 airports in 168 countries or territories across the world. The risk index of 2019-nCoV among the countries had a very high correlation with the WHO-reported confirmed cases (0.97). According to our risk score classification, of the countries that reported at least one Coronavirus-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) case as of 5 February 2020, 24 countries were in the 4th quantile of the risk index, two in the 3rd quantile, one in the 2nd quantile and none in the 1st quantile. Outside China, countries with a higher risk of 2019-nCoV transmission are Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Canada and the USA, all of which reported at least one case. In pan-Europe, UK, France, Russia, Germany and Italy; in North America, USA and Canada; in Oceania, Australia had high risk, all of them reported at least one case. In Africa and South America, the risk of transmission is very low with Ethiopia, South Africa, Egypt, Mauritius and Brazil showing a similar risk of transmission compared to the risk of any of the countries where at least one case is detected. The risk of transmission on 31 January 2020 was very high in neighbouring Asian countries, followed by Europe (UK, France, Russia and Germany), Oceania (Australia) and North America (USA and Canada). Increased public health response including early case recognition, isolation of identified case, contract tracing and targeted airport screening, public awareness and vigilance of health workers will help mitigate the force of further spread to na\u00efve countries.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  2019-nCoV; Africa; COVID-19; China; SARS-COV-2; Wuhan; risk map; transmission\n\n PMID: \t32100667 \tDOI: \t10.1017/S0950268820000424",

Currently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes the outbreaks of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was discovered. Until February 18, 2020, there are 72533 confirmed COVID-19 cases (including 10644 severe cases) and 1872 deaths in China. SARS-CoV-2 is surging in the public and caused substantial burdens due to its human-to-human transmission. However, the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. Finding the possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to prevent further spread of the epidemic. In this study, we used systematic comparison and analysis to predict the interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of coronavirus spike protein and the host receptor, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). The interaction between the key amino acids of S protein RBD and ACE2 indicated that like previous suggested pangolins and snacks, the turtles (C. picta bellii, C. mydas, and P. sinensis) may act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to human.

Purpose To investigate the diagnostic value and consistency of chest CT as compared with comparison to RT-PCR assay in COVID-19. Methods From January 6 to February 6, 2020, 1014 patients in Wuhan, China who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests were included. With RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed. Besides, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative, respectively) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with time-interval of 4 days or more. Results Of 1014 patients, 59% (601/1014) had positive RT-PCR results, and 88% (888/1014) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97% (95%CI, 95-98%, 580/601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR results. In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 75% (308/413) had positive chest CT findings; of 308, 48% were considered as highly likely cases, with 33% as probable cases. By analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval time between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 \u00b1 1.5 days; the initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR result was 6.9 \u00b1 2.3 days). 60% to 93% of cases had initial positive CT consistent with COVID-19 prior (or parallel) to the initial positive RT-PCR results. 42% (24/57) cases showed improvement in follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turning negative. Conclusion Chest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT may be considered as a primary tool for the current COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  2019-nCoV pneumonia; chest CT imaging; diagnostic value; positive rate; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction\n\n PMID: \t32101510 \tDOI: \t10.1148/radiol.2020200642",

Data on confirmed cases diagnosed outside China were analyzed using statistical models to estimate the impact of travel reduction on three epidemiological outcome measures: (i) the number of exported cases, (ii) the probability of a major epidemic, and (iii) the time delay to a major epidemic. From 28 January to 7 February 2020, we estimated that 226 exported cases (95% confidence interval: 86,449) were prevented, corresponding to a 70.4% reduction in incidence compared to the counterfactual scenario. The reduced probability of a major epidemic ranged from 7% to 20% in Japan, which resulted in a median time delay to a major epidemic of two days. Depending on the scenario, the estimated delay may be less than one day. As the delay is small, the decision to control travel volume through restrictions on freedom of movement should be balanced between the resulting estimated epidemiological impact and predicted economic fallout.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:\n\nemerging infectious diseases; imported case; migration; quarantine; travel\n\nPMID: 32102279 DOI: 10.3390/jcm9020601",

Importantly, all of the 6 patients with detectable viral RNA in the blood cohort progressed to severe symptom stage, indicating a strong correlation of serum viral RNA with the disease severity (p-value\u2009=\u20090.0001). Meanwhile, 8 of the 11 patients with annal swab virus-positive was in severe clinical stage. However, the concentration of viral RNA in the anal swab (Ct value\u2009=\u200924\u2009+\u200939) was higher than in the blood (Ct value\u2009=\u200934\u2009+\u200939) from patient 2, suggesting that the virus might replicate in the digestive tract.

It firstly appeared in Wuhan, Hubei province of China in December 2019. During the next two months, it moved rapidly throughout China and spread to multiple countries through infected persons travelling by air. Most of the infected patients have mild symptoms including fever, fatigue and cough. But in severe cases, patients can progress rapidly and develop to the acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy. The new coronavirus was reported to spread via droplets, contact and natural aerosols from human-to-human. Therefore, high-risk aerosol-producing procedures such as endotracheal intubation may put the anesthesiologists at high risk of nosocomial infections. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 infection of anesthesiologists after endotracheal intubation for confirmed COVID-19 patients have been reported in hospitals in Wuhan. The expert panel of airway management in Chinese Society of Anaesthesiology has deliberated and drafted this recommendation, by which we hope to guide the performance of endotracheal intubation by frontline anesthesiologists and critical care physicians. During the airway management, enhanced droplet/airborne PPE should be applied to the health care providers. A good airway assessment before airway intervention is of vital importance. For patients with normal airway, awake intubation should be avoided and modified rapid sequence induction is strongly recommended. Sufficient muscle relaxant should be assured before intubation. For patients with difficult airway, good preparation of airway devices and detailed intubation plans should be made.\n\n\n PMID: \t32102726 \tDOI: \t10.24920/003724",

Currently, the outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) from Wuhan caused a worldwide panic. There are no specific antiviral therapies for COVID-19. However, there are agents that were used during the SARS and MERS epidemics. We could learn from SARS and MERS. Lopinavir (LPV) is an effective agent that inhibits the protease activity of coronavirus. In this review, we discuss the literature on the efficacy of LPV in vitro and in vivo, especially in patients with SARS and MERS, so that we might clarify the potential for the use of LPV in patients with COVID-19.

[Epub ahead of print]  Evolutionary history, potential intermediate animal host, and cross-species analyses of SARS-CoV-2.Li X1, Zai J2, Zhao Q3, Nie Q4, Li Y1, Foley BT5, Chaillon A6.\nAuthor informationAbstract   To investigate the evolutionary history of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in China, a total of 70 genomes of virus strains from China and elsewhere with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 3 February 2020 were analyzed. To explore the potential intermediate animal host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we re-analyzed virome datasets from pangolins and representative SARS-related coronaviruses isolates from bats, with particular attention paid to the spike glycoprotein gene. We performed phylogenetic, split network, transmission network, likelihood-mapping, and comparative analyses of the genomes. Based on Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip-dating method, we estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2, which ranged from 22-24 November 2019 and 1.19-1.31 \u00d7 10-3 substitutions per site per year, respectively. Our results also revealed that the BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 virus was more similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than the coronavirus obtained from the two pangolin samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378). We also identified a unique peptide (PRRA) insertion in the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which may be involved in the proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein by cellular proteases, and thus could impact host range and transmissibility. Interestingly, the coronavirus carried by pangolins did not have the RRAR motif. Therefore, we concluded that the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for the recent outbreak of COVID-19, did not come directly from pangolins. This article is protected by copyright.

[Epub ahead of print]  The neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV2 may be at least partially responsible for the respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients.Li YC1, Bai WZ2, Hashikawa T3.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), another highly pathogenic coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world. This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS-CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The most characteristic symptom of COVID-19 patients is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously. Additionally, some COVID-19 patients also showed neurologic signs such as headache, nausea and vomiting. Increasing evidence shows that coronavriruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases. The infection of SARS-CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected. Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse-connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechano- and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways. In light of the high similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, it is quite likely that the potential invasion of SARS-CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients. Awareness of this will have important guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure. (229 words) This article is protected by copyright.

Although the virus (SARS-Cov-2) nucleic acid RT-PCR test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations. In addition, high false negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients. We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay which can detect IgM and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages. With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses. The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at 8 different clinical sites. The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%. In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples. The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood. The IgM-IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test. It can be used for the rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in hospitals, clinics, and test laboratories. This article is protected by copyright.

[Epub ahead of print]  Immune responses in COVID-19 and potential vaccines: Lessons learned from SARS and MERS epidemic.Prompetchara E1,2,3, Ketloy C1,2, Palaga T4,5.\nAuthor informationAbstract   As the world is witnessing the epidemic of COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerging genetics and clinical evidences suggest a similar path to those of SARS and MERS. The rapid genomic sequencing and open access data, together with advanced vaccine technology, are expected to give us more knowledge on the pathogen itself, including the host immune response as well as the plan for therapeutic vaccines in the near future. This review aims to provide a comparative view among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly epidemic SARS-CoV-2, in the hope to gain a better understanding of the host-pathogen interaction, host immune responses, and the pathogen immune evasion strategies. This predictive view may help in designing an immune intervention or preventive vaccine for COVID-19 in the near future.\n\n\n PMID: \t32105090 \tDOI: \t10.12932/AP-200220-0772",

[Epub ahead of print] Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study.\n\n\nYang X1, Yu Y2, Xu J2, Shu H2, Xia J3, Liu H1, Wu Y2, Zhang L4, Yu Z5, Fang M6, Yu T3, Wang Y2, Pan S2, Zou X2, Yuan S2, Shang Y7.\nAuthor information\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\nMETHODS:\n\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\nFINDINGS:\n\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 59\u00b77 (SD 13\u00b73) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (61\u00b75%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3-11) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64\u00b76 years [11\u00b72] vs 51\u00b79 years [12\u00b79]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13\u00b75%) patients.\nINTERPRETATION:\n\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1-2 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\nFUNDING:\n\nNone.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course.\nMETHODS:  Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done \u22641 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (>2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups.\nFINDINGS:  81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49\u00b75 years (SD 11\u00b70). The mean number of involved lung segments was 10\u00b75 (SD 6\u00b74) overall, 2\u00b78 (3\u00b73) in group 1, 11\u00b71 (5\u00b74) in group 2, 13\u00b70 (5\u00b77) in group 3, and 12\u00b71 (5\u00b79) in group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments). In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]). Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21). Thereafter, the prevalence of ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3, and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4).\nINTERPRETATION:  COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1-3 weeks. Combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.\nFUNDING:  None.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: From October 2018 to March 2019, we implemented a free vaccination policy in healthcare workers in Xining. A face-to-face interview with the head of the infection control department and an online survey for medical staff in four tertiary medical facilities was conducted to understand both the implementation of the free policy and influenza vaccination coverage. Possible factors for influenza vaccination among healthcare workers (physician, nurses working on the front-line, HCWs) were investigated by multivariate-logistic regression. Results: Coverage in two hospitals that implemented the free vaccination policy was 30.5% and 25.9%, respectively, which was statistically different to hospitals that did not implement the free policy (7.2% and 8.7%, respectively) (\u03c72 = 332.56, p < 0.0001). Among vaccinated healthcare workers, 65.5% and 48.6% reported their main reasons for vaccination were a convenient vaccination service and awareness of the free vaccination policy. The reasons for not being vaccinated among the 3389 unvaccinated healthcare workers included: the inconvenient vaccination service (33.8%), believing vaccination was unnecessary (29.7%), concerns about adverse reactions to the vaccine (28.8%), and having to pay for the vaccine (25.6%). Conclusions: Implementing the free vaccination policy, combined with improving the accessibility of the vaccination service, increased seasonal-influenza vaccination-coverage in healthcare workers in Xining.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Xining, China; healthcare workers; influenza; policy intervention; vaccination coverage\n\n PMID: \t32093085 \tDOI: \t10.3390/vaccines8010092 \n  Free full text",

Acetylation at K108 of the NS1 protein is important for the replication and virulence of influenza virus.Ma J1, Wu R2, Xu G3, Cheng Y1, Wang Z1, Wang H1, Yan Y1, Li J4, Sun J5.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza virus is a multifunctional protein that plays an important role in virus replication and virulence. In this study, an acetylation modification was identified at the K108 residue of the NS1 protein of H1N1 influenza virus. To further explore the function of the K108 acetylation modification of the NS1 protein, a deacetylation-mimic mutation (K108R) and a constant acetylation-mimic mutation (K108Q) were introduced into the NS1 protein in the background of A/WSN/1933 H1N1 (WSN), resulting in two mutant viruses (WSN-NS1-108R and WSN-NS1-108Q). In vitro and mouse studies showed that the deacetylation-mimic mutation K108R in the NS1 protein attenuated the replication and virulence of WSN-NS1-108R, while the constant acetylation-mimic mutant virus WSN-NS1-108Q showed similar replication and pathogenicity as the wild-type WSN virus (WSN-wt). The results indicated that acetylation at K108 of the NS1 protein has an important role in the replication and virulence of influenza virus. To further explore the potential mechanism, the type I interferon (IFN-I) antagonistic activity of the three NS1 proteins (NS1-108Q, NS1-108R, and NS1-wt) was compared in cells, which showed that the K108R mutation significantly attenuated the IFN-\u03b2 antagonistic activity of the NS1 protein compared with NS1-wt and NS1-108Q. Both NS1-wt and NS1-108Q inhibited the IFN-\u03b2 response activated by RIG-I CARD domain, MAVS, TBK1, and IRF3 more efficiently than the NS1-108R protein in cells. Taken together, the results indicated that acetylation at NS1 K108 is important for the IFN antagonistic activity of the NS1 protein and virulence of the influenza virus.\n\n\n PMID: \t32093780 \tDOI: \t10.1186/s13567-020-00747-3 \n  Free full text",

To help with this, countries routinely collect incidence of mild and severe respiratory illness and virologic data on circulating subtypes and use these data for situational awareness, burden of disease estimates and severity assessments. Advanced analytics and modelling are increasingly used to aid planning and response activities by describing key features of influenza activity for a given location and generating forecasts that can be translated to useful actions such as enhanced risk communications, and informing clinical supply chains. Here, we describe the formation of the Influenza Incidence Analytics Group (IIAG), a coordinated global effort to apply advanced analytics and modelling to public influenza data, both epidemiological and virologic, in real-time and thus provide additional insights to countries who provide routine surveillance data to WHO. Our objectives are to systematically increase the value of data to health planners by applying advanced analytics and forecasting and for results to be immediately reproducible and deployable using an open repository of data and code. We expect the resources we develop and the associated community to provide an attractive option for the open analysis of key epidemiological data during seasonal epidemics and the early stages of an influenza pandemic.\n  \u00a9 2019 The Authors.

[Epub ahead of print]  Characterising viable virus from air exhaled by H1N1 influenza-infected ferrets reveals the importance of haemagglutinin stability for airborne infectivity.Singanayagam A1, Zhou J1, Elderfield RA1, Frise R1, Ashcroft J1, Galiano M2, Miah S2, Nicolaou L3, Barclay WS1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   The transmissibility and pandemic potential of influenza viruses depends on their ability to efficiently replicate and be released from an infected host, retain viability as they pass through the environment, and then initiate infection in the next host. There is a significant gap in knowledge about viral properties that enable survival of influenza viruses between hosts, due to a lack of experimental methods to reliably isolate viable virus from the air. Using a novel technique, we isolate and characterise infectious virus from droplets emitted by 2009 pandemic H1N1-infected ferrets. We demonstrate that infectious virus is predominantly released early after infection. A virus containing a mutation destabilising the haemagglutinin (HA) surface protein displayed reduced survival in air. Infectious virus recovered from droplets exhaled by ferrets inoculated with this virus contained mutations that conferred restabilisation of HA, indicating the importance of influenza HA stability for between-host survival. Using this unique approach can improve knowledge about the determinants and mechanisms of influenza transmissibility and ultimately could be applied to studies of airborne virus exhaled from infected people.\n\n\n PMID: \t32097448 \tDOI: \t10.1371/journal.ppat.1008362 \n  Free full text",

Additionally, favipiravir is being stockpiled for 2 million people as a countermeasure for novel influenza strains. This drug functions as a chain terminator at the site of incorporation of the viral RNA and reduces the viral load. Favipiravir cures all mice in a lethal influenza infection model, while oseltamivir fails to cure the animals. Thus, favipiravir contributes to curing animals with lethal infection. In addition to influenza, favipiravir has a broad spectrum of anti-RNA virus activities in vitro and efficacies in animal models with lethal RNA viruses and has been used for treatment of human infection with life-threatening Ebola virus, Lassa virus, rabies, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. The best feature of favipiravir as an antiviral agent is the apparent lack of generation of favipiravir-resistant viruses. Favipiravir alone maintains its therapeutic efficacy from the first to the last patient in an influenza pandemic or an epidemic lethal RNA virus infection. Favipiravir is expected to be an important therapeutic agent for severe influenza, the next pandemic influenza strain, and other severe RNA virus infections for which standard treatments are not available.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020.

The Central Role of Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1) in Influenza Biology and Infection.Ros\u00e1rio-Ferreira N1,2, Preto AJ2, Melo R2,3, Moreira IS2,4, Brito RMM1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Influenza (flu) is a contagious viral disease, which targets the human respiratory tract and spreads throughout the world each year. Every year, influenza infects around 10% of the world population and between 290,000 and 650,000 people die from it according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and have a negative sense eight-segment single-stranded RNA genome that encodes 11 different proteins. The only control over influenza seasonal epidemic outbreaks around the world are vaccines, annually updated according to viral strains in circulation, but, because of high rates of mutation and recurrent genetic assortment, new viral strains of influenza are constantly emerging, increasing the likelihood of pandemics. Vaccination effectiveness is limited, calling for new preventive and therapeutic approaches and a better understanding of the virus-host interactions. In particular, grasping the role of influenza non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and related known interactions in the host cell is pivotal to better understand the mechanisms of virus infection and replication, and thus propose more effective antiviral approaches. In this review, we assess the structure of NS1, its dynamics, and multiple functions and interactions, to highlight the central role of this protein in viral biology and its potential use as an effective therapeutic target to tackle seasonal and pandemic influenza.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  NS1; PPIs; influenza virus; molecular modeling; protein structure; protein\u2013protein interactions; structural bioinformatics\n\n PMID: \t32098424 \tDOI: \t10.3390/ijms21041511",

[Epub ahead of print]  Seasonal influenza vaccine and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome: A self-controlled case series study.Grave C1, Boucheron P2, Rudant J2, Mikaeloff Y2, Tubert-Bitter P2, Escolano S2, Hocine MN2, Coste J2, Weill A2.\nAuthor informationAbstract OBJECTIVE:  To evaluate the risk of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) following seasonal influenza vaccination based on French nationwide data.\nMETHODS:  All cases of GBS occurring in metropolitan France between September 1 and March 31 from 2010 to 2014 were identified from the French national health data system. Data were analyzed according to the self-controlled case series method. The risk period started 1 day after the patient received vaccine (D1) until 42 days after vaccination (D42). The incidence of GBS during this risk period was compared to that of the control period (D43-March 31). The incidence rate ratio (IRR) was estimated after adjusting for seasonality and presence or not of acute infections.\nRESULTS:  Between September and March, of the 2010/2011 to 2013/2014 influenza vaccination seasons, 3,523 cases of GBS occurred in metropolitan France and were included in the study. Among them, 15% (527 patients) had received influenza vaccination. A total of 140 patients developed GBS during the 42 days following influenza vaccination. The crude risk of developing GBS was not significantly increased during the 42 days following influenza vaccination (IRR, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-1.25; p = 0.85). This result remained nonsignificant after adjustment for calendar months and the incidence of acute gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections (IRR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.89-1.37; p = 0.38). In contrast, the risk of GBS was fourfold higher after acute respiratory tract infection (IRR, 3.89; 95% CI, 3.52-4.30; p < 0.0001) or gastrointestinal infection (IRR, 3.64; 95% CI, 3.01-4.40; p < 0.0001).\nCONCLUSIONS:  No association between seasonal influenza vaccination and GBS was shown during the 42 days following vaccination.\n  \u00a9 2020 American Academy of Neurology.\n\n\n PMID: \t32098853 \tDOI: \t10.1212/WNL.0000000000009180",

Studies during the A(H3N2)-dominated 2017-18 season showed slightly higher RVE for the cell-cultured vaccine compared to SD egg-based vaccines. We investigated the RVE of influenza vaccines among Medicare beneficiaries ages \u226565 years during the 2018-19 season.\nMETHODS:\n\nRetrospective cohort study using inverse probability of treatment weighting and Poisson regression to evaluate RVE in preventing influenza hospital encounters.\nRESULTS:\n\nAmong 12,777,214 beneficiaries, the egg-based adjuvanted (RVE 7.7%, 95% CI: 3.9 to 11.4%) and high-dose (RVE 4.9%, 95% CI: 1.7 to 8.1%) vaccines were marginally more effective than the egg-based quadrivalent vaccines. The cell-cultured quadrivalent vaccines were not significantly more effective than the egg-based quadrivalent vaccines (RVE 2.5%, 95% CI: -2.4 to 7.3%).\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nWe did not find major effectiveness differences between licensed vaccines used among the elderly during the 2018-19 season. Consistent with prior research, we found that the egg-based adjuvanted and high-dose vaccines were slightly more effective than the egg-based quadrivalent vaccines.\nPublished by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America 2020.

The first bivalent, intranasal, live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV; Ingelvac Provenza), with H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, has been approved for use in swine. We investigated the LAIV hemagglutinin (HA) sequences in diagnostic cases submitted to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and potential vaccine virus reassortment with endemic influenza A virus (IAV) in swine. From January 3 to October 11, 2018, IAV HA sequences demonstrating 99.5-99.9% nucleotide homology to the H1 HA or 99.4-100% nucleotide homology to the H3 HA parental strains in the LAIV were detected in 58 of 1,116 (5.2%) porcine respiratory cases (H1 HA A/swine/Minnesota/37866/1999[H1N1; MN99]; H3 HA A/swine/Texas/4199-2/1998[H3N2; TX98]). Nine cases had co-detection of HA genes from LAIV and wild-type IAV in the same specimen. Thirty-five cases had associated epidemiologic information that indicated they were submitted from 11 states representing 31 individual sites and 17 production systems in the United States. Whole genome sequences from 11 cases and another subset of 2 plaque-purified IAV were included in our study. Ten whole genome sequences, including 1 plaque-purified IAV, contained at least one internal gene from endemic IAV detected within the past 3 y. Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequences indicated that reassortment occurred between vaccine virus and endemic field strains circulating in U.S. swine. Our data highlight the need and importance of continued IAV surveillance to detect emerging IAV with LAIV genes in the swine population.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  influenza A virus; live attenuated influenza virus vaccine; reassortment; swine\n\n PMID: \t32100644 \tDOI: \t10.1177/1040638720907918",

Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy Associated with Influenza A.Bailey HE1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   A severe and unusual complication found in children with influenza is an acute necrotizing encephalopathy. A 20-month-old female with no significant past medical history was admitted to our facility, presenting with a 4-day history of worsening fever, upper respiratory symptoms, new-onset altered mental status and episodes of extensor posturing. The initial concern was a dystonic reaction secondary to promethazine following a recent diagnosis of influenza A virus. A head computed tomography scan indicated concern for widespread edema, and the video EEG revealed focal slowing in the frontocentral regions with no epileptiform activity during episodes of extensor posturing. The first magnetic resonance imaging results were consistent with acute hemorrhagic encephalitis or severe anoxic brain injury for which there is a broad differential. A second MRI five days later found new areas of restricted diffusion that were consistent with acute necrotizing encephalitis.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Decerebrate posturing; encephalopathy; influenza A; necrotizing; rare disease\n\n PMID: \t32101112 \tDOI: \t10.1080/21646821.2020.1725864",

Hospital admission, prescription, and vital status data were assessed using Danish nationwide registries. We utilized monthly/weekly surveillance data for enterovirus and influenza from the Danish National Microbiology Database (2010-2016) that receives copies of laboratory tests from all Danish departments of clinical microbiology.\nRESULTS:  Of the 4,659 consecutively enrolled STEMI patients, 581 (12%) had VF before primary percutaneous coronary intervention. In a subset (n = 807), we found that VF patients experienced more generalized fatigue and flu-like symptoms within 7 days before STEMI compared with the patients without VF (OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.76-6.54). During the study period, 2,704 individuals were diagnosed with enterovirus and 19,742 with influenza. No significant association between enterovirus and VF (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99-1.02), influenza and VF (OR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00-1.00), or week number and VF (p-value 0.94 for enterovirus and 0.89 for influenza) was found.\nCONCLUSION:  We found no clear seasonality of VF during first STEMI. Even though VF patients had experienced more generalized fatigue and flu-like symptoms within 7 days before STEMI compared with patients without VF, no relationship was found between enterovirus or influenza exposure and occurrence of VF.\n\n\n PMID: \t32101559 \tDOI: \t10.1371/journal.pone.0226936",

Vaccine effectiveness of cell-culture relative to egg-based inactivated influenza vaccine during the 2017-18 influenza season.Klein NP1, Fireman B1, Goddard K1, Zerbo O1, Asher J2, Zhou J2, King J2, Lewis N1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   There is concern that influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) may be attenuated by passage in eggs during manufacture. We compared quadrivalent cell-culture vaccine with egg-based vaccines, most of which were trivalent, against influenza A and B during 2017-2018 when A(H3N2) and B/Yamagata (present only in quadrivalent vaccines) predominated. We retrospectively examined risk of PCR-confirmed influenza A and B in members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California aged 4-64 years. We estimated the relative VE (rVE) of cell-culture vaccine versus egg-based vaccines, and the absolute VE (aVE) of each vaccine comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals. Analyses used Cox regression with a calendar timeline, stratified by birth year, and adjusted for demographics, co-morbidities and utilization. One-third (1,016,965/3,053,248) of the population was vaccinated; 932,545 (91.7% of vaccinees) received egg-based and 84,420 (8.3%) received cell-culture vaccines. The rVE against influenza A was 8.0% (95% CI: -10, 23); aVE was 31.7% (CI: 18.7, 42.6) for cell-culture and 20.1% (CI: 14.5, 25.4) for egg-based vaccines. The rVE against influenza B was 39.6% (CI: 27.9, 49.3); aVE was 40.9% (CI: 30, 50.1) for cell-culture and 9.7% (CI 3.5, 15.6) for egg-based trivalent vaccines. Inclusion of the B/Yamagata lineage in the quadrivalent cell-based vaccine provided better protection against influenza B but vaccine effectiveness against influenza A was low for both the cell-culture vaccine and the egg-based vaccines. Improving influenza vaccines requires ongoing comparative vaccine effectiveness monitoring.\n\n\n PMID: \t32101582 \tDOI: \t10.1371/journal.pone.0229279",

After IAVs spread to the lung, extensive pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are released, which largely determine the outcome of infection. Using a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) assay, we systematically and sequentially analyzed the transcriptome of more than 16,000 immune cells in the pulmonary tissue of infected mice, and demonstrated that two waves of pro-inflammatory factors were released. A group of IAV-infected PD-L1+ neutrophils were the major contributor to the first wave at an earlier stage (day 1-3 post infection). Notably, at a later stage (day 7 post infection) when IAV was hardly detected in the immune cells, a group of platelet factor 4-positive (Pf4+)-macrophages generated another wave of pro-inflammatory factors, which were probably the precursors of alveolar macrophages (AMs). Furthermore, single-cell signaling map identified inter-lineage crosstalk between different clusters and helped better understand the signature of PD-L1+ neutrophils and Pf4+-macrophages. Our data characteristically clarified the infiltrated immune cells and their production of pro-inflammatory factors during the immunopathogenesis development, and deciphered the important mechanisms underlying IAV-driven inflammatory reactions in the lung.\n\n\n PMID: \t32101596 \tDOI: \t10.1371/journal.ppat.1008334",

We report the case of a 41-year-old woman with CADASIL who developed multiple border-zone infarcts due to influenza A virus infection. The patient had no apparent history or episode of stroke or altered consciousness following the onset of respiratory symptoms, which were due to the influenza A infection. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images of the brain showed multiple acute-phase infarcts in border-zone areas of both cerebral hemispheres and the corpus callosum; fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery magnetic resonance images showed increased signal in the subcortical areas of both temporal poles. Gene analysis identified a heterozygous mutation c.160C>T in exon 2 of the NOTCH3 gene (p.Arg54Cys). A diagnosis of CADASIL was established. Our case demonstrates that infectious conditions such as influenza A can trigger multiple border-zone infarctions in patients with CADASIL.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The severity was apparently high, as shown by the high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (22, 17 to 29) and pneumonia severity index score (118, 88 to 151). XGBoost model (area under the curve (AUC): 0.842; 95% CI 0.749 to 0.928) outperformed RF (AUC: 0.809; 95% CI 0.629 to 0.891) and LR (AUC: 0.701; 95% CI 0.573 to 0.825) for predicting 30-day mortality. To give clinicians an intuitive understanding of feature exploitation, we stratified features by the clinical domain. The cumulative feature importance in the fluid balance domain, ventilation domain, laboratory data domain, demographic and symptom domain, management domain and severity score domain was 0.253, 0.113, 0.177, 0.140, 0.152 and 0.165, respectively.

In order to analyze if the microbiota could contribute to the control of influenza virus replication in ducks, we used a broad-spectrum oral antibiotic treatment to deplete the microbiota before infection with a highly pathogenic H5N9 avian influenza virus. Antibiotic-treated ducks and non-treated control ducks did not show any clinical signs following H5N9 virus infection. We did not detect any significant difference in virus titers neither in the respiratory tract nor in the brain nor spleen. However, we found that antibiotic-treated H5N9 virus-infected ducks had significantly increased intestinal virus excretion at day 3 and 5 post-infection. This was associated with a significantly decreased antiviral immune response in the intestine of antibiotic-treated ducks. Our findings highlight the importance of an intact microbiota for an efficient control of avian influenza virus replication in ducks.IMPORTANCEDucks are frequently infected with avian influenza viruses belonging to multiple subtypes. They represent an important reservoir species of avian influenza viruses, which can occasionally be transmitted to other bird species or mammals, including humans. Ducks thus have a central role in the epidemiology of influenza virus infection. Importantly, ducks usually show little or no clinical signs even following infection with a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. We provide evidence that the microbiota contributes to the control of influenza virus replication in ducks by modulating the antiviral immune response. Ducks are able to control influenza virus replication more efficiently when they have an intact intestinal microbiota. Therefore, maintaining a healthy microbiota by limiting perturbations to its composition should contribute to prevention of avian influenza virus spread from the duck reservoir.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 American Society for Microbiology.\n\n\n PMID: \t32102887 \tDOI: \t10.1128/JVI.00289-20",

Nanoparticles based on polymers such as chitosan (CHT) and its water soluble derivative, trimethylchitosan (TMC), could be successfully used as carrier/adjuvant for this purpose. Sodium alginate, a negatively charged biopolymer, could modify the immunostimulatory properties of CHT and TMC NPs and increase their stability. Sodium alginate (ALG)-coated chitosan (CHT) and trimethylchitosan (TMC) nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with inactivated PR8 influenza virus were successfully prepared by direct coating of the virus with CHT or TMC polymers to evaluate their immunoadjuvant potential after nasal immunization. After nasal immunizations in BALB/c mice, PR8-CHT formulation elicited higher IgG2a and IgG1 antibody titers compared with PR8-TMC. ALG coating of this formulation (PR8-CHT-ALG) significantly decreased the antibody titers and a less immune response was induced than PR8-TMC-ALG formulation. PR8-TMC-ALG formulation showed significantly higher IgG2a/IgG1 ratio, as criteria for Th1-type immune response, compared with PR8-CHT-ALG and PR8 virus alone. Altogether, the PR8-TMC-ALG formulation could be considered as an efficient intranasal antigen delivery system for nasal vaccines.\n  \u00a9 2018 Shenyang Pharmaceutical University.

[Epub ahead of print]  Understanding influenza vaccination among Portuguese elderly: the social ecological framework.Machado A1,2, Santos AJ1,2, Kislaya I1,2, Larrauri A3, Nunes B1,2.\nAuthor informationAbstract   This study intended to identify and quantify the social ecological model (SEM) levels associated to seasonal IV uptake in the Portuguese elderly population. Data from the 2014 National Health Survey was restricted to individuals aged 65+ years (n\u2009=\u20095669). Twenty-three independent variables were allocated to the SEM levels: individual, interpersonal, organizational, community and policy. Sex stratified and age adjusted analysis using Poisson regression were performed for each level and for a fitted full model. Relative reduction in pseudo R magnitude measured marginal contribution of each level. For men and women, older groups (85+ vs. 65-69; men, PR\u2009=\u20091.59 and women, PR\u2009=\u20091.56); having 3+ chronic conditions (men, PR\u2009=\u20091.39 and women, PR\u2009=\u20091.35); previous 4 weeks GP and outpatient visits were associated to higher IV uptake. For men, only 2 SEM levels were associated (individual and organizational) while for women the community level was also relevant. Main marginal contribution came from individual (17.9% and 16.3%) and organizational (30.7% and 22.7%) levels. This study highlights the importance of individual characteristics, access and use of health care services for the IV uptake and the sex differential behaviour.\n  \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

Since 1970s, influenza B has diverged intoVictoria and Yamagata, which differs in antigenic and evolutionary characteristics. Yet, molecular-epidemiological information of influenza B from developing nations is limited. In central Vietnam, influenza A subtype-specific circulation pattern and clinical characteristics were previously described. However, molecular evolutionary characteristics of influenza B has not been discussed to date. We utilized the influenza B positives obtained from paediatric ARI surveillance during 2007-2013. Influenza B HA and NA genes were amplified, sequenced, and phylogenetic/molecular evolutionary analysis was performed using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian MCMC. Phylodynamics analysis was performed with Bayesian Skyline Plot (BSP). Furthermore, we performed selection pressure analysis and estimated N-glycosylation sites. In the current study, overall positive rate for influenza B was 3.0%, and Victoria lineage immediately became predominant in post-A/H1N1pdm09 period. The noticeable shift in Victoria lineage WHO Group occurred. With respect to the evolutionary rate (substitutions/site/year), Victoria lineage HA gene was evolving faster than Yamagata lineage (2.43\u202f\u00d7\u202f10-3 vs 2.00\u202f\u00d7\u202f10-3). Furthermore, the evolutionary rate of Victoria Group 5 was greater than Group 1. BSP presented the rapid growth in Effective Population Size (EPS) of Victoria lineage occurred soon after the 1st A/H1N1pdm09 case was detected whereas the EPS of Yamagata lineage was stable for both genes. N-glycosylation pattern between lineages and among WHO Groups were slightly different, and HA gene had a total of 6 amino acid substitutions under positive section pressure (4 for Victoria and 2 for Yamagata). The current results highlight the importance of Victoria lineage in post-A/H1N1pdm09 period. Difference in evolutionary characteristics and phylodynamics may indicate lineage and WHO Group-specific evolutionary dynamics. It is necessary to further continue the molecular-epidemiological surveillance in local setting to gain a better understanding of local evolutionary characteristics of influenza B strains.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2019.

It supersedes guidance provided in CDC\u2019s HAN 427 distributed on February 1, 2020.\n\nThe outbreak that began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, has now spread throughout China and to 46 other countries and territories, including the United States. As of February 27, 2020, there were 78,497 reported cases in China and 3,797 cases in locations outside China. In addition to sustained transmission in China, there is evidence of community spread in several additional countries. CDC has updated travel guidance to reflect this information (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...ers/index.html).\n\nTo date, there has been limited spread of COVID-19 in the United States. As of February 26, 2020, there were a total of 61 cases within the United States, 46 of these were among repatriated persons from high-risk settings. The other 15 cases were diagnosed in the United States; 12 were persons with a history of recent travel in China and 2 were persons in close household contact with a COVID-19 patient (i.e. person-to-person spread). One patient with COVID-19 who had no travel history or links to other known cases was reported on February 26, 2020, in California. The California Department of Public Health, local health departments, clinicians, and CDC are working together to investigate this case and are identifying contacts with whom this individual interacted.\n\nCDC, state and local health departments, other federal agencies, and other partners have been implementing measures to slow and contain transmission of COVID-19 in the United States. These measures include assessing, monitoring, and caring for travelers arriving from areas with substantial COVID-19 transmission and identifying cases and contacts of cases in the United States.\n\nRecognizing persons at risk for COVID-19 is a critical component of identifying cases and preventing further transmission. With expanding spread of COVID-19, additional areas of geographic risk are being identified and PUI criteria are being updated to reflect this spread. To prepare for possible additional person-to-person spread of COVID-19 in the United States, CDC continues to recommend that clinicians and state and local health departments consider COVID-19 in patients with severe respiratory illness even in the absence of travel history to affected areas or known exposure to another case.\n\nCriteria to Guide Evaluation and Testing of Patients Under Investigation (PUI) for COVID-19\nLocal or state health departments, in consultation with clinicians, should determine whether a patient is a PUI for COVID-19. The CDC clinical criteria for COVID-19 PUIs have been developed based on available information about this novel virus, as well as what is known about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (https://www.cdc.gov/sars/clinical/guidance.html) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers...tml#evaluation). These criteria are subject to change as additional information becomes available.\n\nClinical Features\n\nEpidemiologic Risk\n\nFever1or signs/symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough or shortness of breath)\nAND\nAny person, including healthcare personnel2, who has had close contact3 with a laboratory-confirmed4  COVID-19 patient within 14 days of symptom onset\n\nFever1and signs/symptoms of a lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough or shortness of breath) requiring hospitalization\nAND\nA history of travel from affected geographic areas5, within 14 days of symptom onset\n\nFever1 with severe acute lower respiratory illness (e.g., pneumonia, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) requiring hospitalization and without an alternative explanatory diagnosis (e.g., influenza).6\n\nAND\nNo identified source of exposure\n\n\n\n\nThese criteria are intended to serve as guidance for evaluation. In consultation with public health departments, patients should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine the need for testing. Testing may be considered for deceased persons who would otherwise meet the PUI criteria.\n\n1Fever may be subjective or confirmed.\n\n2For healthcare personnel, testing may be considered if there has been exposure to a person with suspected COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation. Because of their often extensive and close contact with vulnerable patients in healthcare settings, even mild signs and symptoms (e.g., sore throat) of COVID-19 should be evaluated among potentially exposed healthcare personnel. Additional information is available in CDC\u2019s Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...sment-hcp.html).\n\n3Close contact is defined as\u2014a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case\n\n\u2013 or \u2013b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., being coughed on)\nIf such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met.\n\nAdditional information is available in CDC\u2019s updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed COVID-19 or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...endations.html).\n\nData to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk, as does exposure to a severely ill patient). Special consideration should be given to healthcare personnel exposed in healthcare settings, as described in CDC\u2019s Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with COVID-19 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...sment-hcp.html).\n\n4Documentation of laboratory-confirmation of COVID-19 may not be possible for travelers or persons caring for COVID-19 patients in other countries.\n\n5Affected areas are defined as geographic regions where sustained community transmission has been identified.  Relevant affected areas will be defined as a country with at least a CDC Level 2 Travel Health Notice. Current information is available in CDC\u2019s COVID-19 Travel Health Notices (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers).\n\n6Category includes single or clusters of patients with severe acute lower respiratory illness (e.g., pneumonia, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) of unknown etiology in which COVID-19 is being considered.\n\nRecommendations for Reporting, Testing, and Specimen Collection\nClinicians should immediately implement recommended infection prevention and control practices (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html) if a patient is suspected of having COVID-19. They should also notify infection control personnel at their healthcare facility and their state or local health department if a patient is classified as a PUI for COVID-19. State health departments that have identified a PUI or a laboratory-confirmed case should complete a PUI and Case Report form through the processes identified on CDC\u2019s Coronavirus Disease 2019 website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...rting-pui.html). State and local health departments can contact CDC\u2019s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for assistance with obtaining, storing, and shipping appropriate specimens to CDC for testing, including after hours or on weekends or holidays. Currently, diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is being performed at state public health laboratories and CDC.Testing for other respiratory pathogens should not delay specimen testing for COVID-19.\n\nFor initial diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, CDC recommends collecting and testing upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal AND oropharyngeal swabs). CDC also recommends testing lower respiratory tract specimens, if available. For patients who develop a productive cough, sputum should be collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2. The induction of sputum is not recommended. For patients for whom it is clinically indicated (e.g., those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation), a lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage sample should be collected and tested as a lower respiratory tract specimen. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a PUI is identified, regardless of the time of symptom onset. See Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Patients Under Investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...specimens.html) and Biosafety FAQs for handling and processing specimens from suspected cases and PUIs (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019...fety-faqs.html).\n\nFor More Information\nMore information is available at the COVID-19 website: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html.",

Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R0), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort.\nFindings\nSimulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R0 of 1\u00b75, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R0 was 2\u00b75 or 3\u00b75 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1\u00b75 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R0 of 2\u00b75 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3\u00b75 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1\u00b75. For R0 values of 2\u00b75 or 3\u00b75, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.\nInterpretation\nIn most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Global Challenges Research Fund, and Health Data Research UK.",

His entourage (one person) was confined to his home with treatment in accordance with the procedures adopted by the Principality of Monaco.\n\n\nAn epidemiological investigation is initiated in order to know the movements operated by the patient during the last days and to identify the people with whom he would have been in contact.\n\nThe Princely Government maintains the precautionary measures announced these last two days.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GvtMonaco/",

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, the WHO's director-general, said 24 cases in 14 countries have been exported from Italy and 97 cases in 11 countries have been exported from Iran. He said the growing number of cases and affected countries is clearly a concern.\n  But he urged countries not to give up hope on containing the virus, pointing to promising trends in China and Singapore that resulted from strict application of basic public health practices, such as finding and breaking transmission chains. Different scenarios are playing out in different countries, even within different countries, he said. For example, Tedros noted though there are hot spots, there are also 23 countries that still have just one case, plus a number of them with 10 or less.\n  Calling the epidemic a pandemic would signal a shift from containment to mitigation, WHO officials said today. Tedros said there's still a window for containment, but it is getting narrower and narrower by the day. He said there are 10 things individuals can do, such as washing hands frequently, cleaning surfaces regularly, avoiding travel while sick, and calling ahead before coming into a clinic.\n  In other WHO developments today, officials published a written report of the WHO-led joint mission to China and said a WHO mission to investigate Iran's outbreak is having a tough time booking travel arrangements, but with help from the United Arab Emirates hopes to arrive by Monday.\nSouth Korea cases blow past 2,000  South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) today reported 571 new cases, raising its total to 2,337. The number of deaths remained at 13.\n  In China, the National Health Commission reported 327 new cases, 44 more deaths, and 394 fewer serious cases, bringing the overall respective totals to 78,824, 2,788, and 7,952.\n  Japan today reported 17 more cases and 2 asymptomatic carriers, lifting its total to 208 cases, though it notes an overall total of 230 cases with 22 asymptomatic carriers. One of the cases today is an asymptomatic quarantine officer.\n  Hokkaido, a recent hot spot, has 9 of the new cases. The others are from Sagamihara, Shizuoka, Sapporo, Ishikawa prefecture, Nagoya, and Osaka.\n  Also, Japan reported two more deaths in Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers, raising the total to 6. One is a man from the United Kingdom whose age wasn't listed and the other is woman in her 70s from Tokyo.\n  Elsewhere in Asia, Singapore reported 2 more cases, both linked to a new workplace cluster, raising its total to 98. And Malaysia reported 2 more cases, a Japanese woman who works in Malaysia who had traveled to Japan and Indonesia, and an Italian man who lives in Malaysia and recently traveled to Italy for work, the New Straits Times reported today. Malaysia now has 25 cases.\nIran reports another spike; WHO mission to visit  Iran's health ministry today reported 143 cases and 8 more deaths, raising its total to 338, which includes 34 deaths. More than 100 of the new cases are from Gilan and Qom provinces.\n  However, hospital sources in Iran told the BBC that the government's death total is a steep underestimate and that the real total is 210, which a government health official has denied.\n  In a related development, New Zealand today reported its first case, which involved a traveler from Iran. Likewise, Azerbaijan and Belarus reported their first cases, both linked to Iran travel.\n  And Australia reported another new case in Queensland state, which also involves a 63-year-old woman who traveled from Iran.\n  Since yesterday, at least three more already affected Middle East countries have reported new cases, including Bahrain, Iraq, and Kuwait, according to a Twitter update from the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean regional office.\nItaly's surge continues  Italy today reported 238 more cases, boosting its total to 888. It also reported 4 more deaths, raising the fatality count to 21. Three northern regions make up 827 of the country's cases: Lombardy, Veneto, and Emilia Romagna.\n  In related developments today, two countries far from Italy reported their first cases today, both linked to Italy travel: Nigeria and Mexico. The case in Nigeria marks the third detection in Africa, alongside Egypt and Algeria, and involves an Italian citizen working in Lagos who returned from a trip to Italy earlier this week, Nigeria Centers for Disease Control said in a statement.\n  Mexico has two cases, one a man in Mexico City and the other a man from Sinaloa state, one of whom had contact with someone from Italy, the Associated Press reported today, noting that at least five family contacts have been isolated.\n  Meanwhile, at least four more European countries reported their first cases today, all linked to Italy travel. They include Lithuania, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Iceland.\n  Also, already affected European countries reported more cases, including Croatia, Greece, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Spain.\n  France's total today rose by 19 cases to 57, and the country's health minister warned that the virus is circulating in the community, Reuters reported. Germany's total rose to 53, according to an update from the Robert Koch Institute. Also, Spain reported 17 more cases in two update today, putting its total at 34.\n  And the United Kingdom reported its first local case, raising England's total to 18, and San Marino, a small country surrounded by Italy, reported its first case, involving an 88-year-old man who had not traveled outside the country.",

The patients were given antiviral medication and recovered 12 to 32 days after symptom onset. After meeting the criteria for hospital release or lifting of quarantine, the patients were asked to remain at home for another 5 days.\n  RT-PCR was performed again 5 to 13 days later and repeated three times over the next 4 or 5 days\u2014and all tests were positive. Another RT-PCR test with a kit from a different manufacturer confirmed the results. The patients were asymptomatic, CT showed no changes, and they reported no contact with anyone with respiratory symptoms or infected family members.\n  \"Further studies should follow up patients who are not healthcare professionals and who have more severe infection after hospital discharge or discontinuation of quarantine,\" the authors noted. \"Longitudinal studies on a larger cohort would help to understand the prognosis of the disease.\"\nExperts recommend cautious interpretation  Although the results are interesting, it should be noted that RT-PCR measures viral genomic material but doesn't necessarily indicate contagiousness, said Stanley Perlman, MD, PhD, professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City.\n  \"Genomic material comes from virus, of course, but it does not indicate that infectious virus is present,\" Perlman said, adding that a positive test means that virus or was present a day or two before. \"Certainly [RT-PCR] is useful diagnostically; it is less useful for telling us whether someone is contagious.\" He was not involved in the study.\n  He added, \"The patients may be patient carriers or they may just have viral genomic material without any infectious virus. It is hard to know\u2014and hard to know if they are infectious as well. This is all murky at present.\"\n  Florian Krammer PhD, virologist and vaccinologist in the Department of Microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, said on Twitter that the RNA of many viruses can be detected months after viral shedding has ended.\n  \"Follow-up tests can turn positive after a few negative tests, eg because sampling was better,\" Krammer said. \"Also, and this is a very important point, just because somebody still tests positive in a nuclei acid-based test does not mean they are still shedding infectious virus.\"\nSome patients lack fever, CT findings at first  In other research news, investigators at Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease in China published a report on COVID-19 symptoms and severity today in The New England Journal of Medicine, noting a 1.4% death in hospitalized patients and the fact that some patients had no fever or radiographic abnormalities initially.\n  The investigators mined the medical records of 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 522 hospitals in 30 Chinese provinces from December 2019 to Jan 29. The patients' median age was 47 years, and 41.9% were women.\n  Sixty-seven (6.1%) of the patients reached the primary composite end point of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (5.0%), mechanical ventilation (2.3%), or death (1.4%). Only 1.9% had contact with wildlife, while 72.3% of non-Wuhan residents had contact with Wuhan residents, including 31.3% who had traveled to the city.\n  The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on hospitalization and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea occurred in only 3.8%. While fluid buildup was commonly seen on chest CT (56.4%), no radiographic or CT abnormalities were seen in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and five of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia (low white blood cell count) was seen in 83.2% of patients at admission.\n  \"Some patients with COVID-19 do not have fever or radiologic abnormalities on initial presentation, which has complicated the diagnosis,\" the authors wrote.\nComorbidities and risk for poor outcomes  Meanwhile, a retrospective non\u2013peer-reviewed article by much the same group of researchers in Guangzhou, China, found that co-existing diseases are found in about one quarter of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and tend to worsen the patients' prognosis.\n  The study of 1,590 patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19 from 575 hospitals across China, published yesterday on medRxiv, collected data from Nov 21, 2019, to Jan 31.\n  Mean patient age was 48.9 years, and 686 (42.7%) were women. Severe cases made up 16.0% of the study population, and 131 (8.2%) reached the primary end points of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or death. (The fatality rate was 3.1%.)\n  At least one comorbidity was reported in 399 (25.1%) of patients, the most common of which were high blood pressure (269, 16.9%) and cardiovascular disease (59, 3.7%). Two or more comorbidities were reported in 130 (8.2%) of patients, who had a significantly elevated risk of reaching an end point compared with those with one comorbidity and an even higher risk than those with none (P < 0.05).\n  After adjusting for age and smoking status, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (hazard ratio [HR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.4-5.0), diabetes (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0-2.5), high blood pressure (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3), and cancer (HR, 3.5, 95% CI 1.6-7.6) were most likely to reach an end point than those without those diseases.\n  The death rate among COVID-19 patients with one or more comorbidities was 5.6%.\nUK's first patients did not meet testing criteria  Finally, researchers at Hull University in Hull, England, published a letter yesterday in The Lancet describing how their country's first two COVID-19 patients tested positive for the virus even though they didn't meet current case definitions.\n  The patients were identified as at-risk while still in the community and transported from their hotel to the university hospital, where they were tested.\n  The researchers said that the case highlights important points about the management of COVID-19. \"Had [clinical] criteria been strictly applied, testing might not have been done,\" they wrote, noting that applying case definitions is the best way to target testing. \"However, with any newly emerging infection, case definitions must evolve rapidly as information accrues.\"",

She also said that by next week, six US flu surveillance sites will also begin testing for COVID-19, in an effort to cast a wider net on the novel coronavirus, which has spread to 53 countries since it was first identified in Wuhan, China, less than 3 month ago.\n  Two more Americans repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship have also been diagnosed as having COVID-19, Messonnier said. There are now 44 cases in Americans repatriated from Wuhan or the cruise ship, 12 cases in Americans who had a travel history to China, 2 cases in spouses of known cases, and 1 case possibly tied to community spread in California.\nBroader definition for case investigations  Messonnier also said the country should expect to see more cases tied to the most recent case confirmed in California, what is likely to be the first instance of community spread in the United States.\n  \"The situation has evolved and continues to evolve very quickly,\" she said. The CDC will now begin testing patients for COVID-19 if they have recent travel history to China, or Iran, Italy, South Korea, or Japan, as well as fever and signs of respiratory illness. This broadens the PUI, or persons under investigation, the CDC is testing for the novel coronavirus.\n  Patients with signs of severe lower respiratory infections without alternative diagnosis (such as influenza) will also be tested.\n  The California patient, currently being treated at UC-Davis Medical Center, was severely sick for several days, but was not tested for COVID-19 because he or she had no travel history to China or known contact with cases. Messonnier contradicted media reports, which have said physicians were denied COVID-19 testing for the patient for up to 4 days, before the patient was tested on Feb 23.\n  \"According to CDC records, the first call we got about this patient was Sunday the 23rd,\" Messonnier said.\n  Yesterday UC-Davis said three people were being kept in isolation because of possible exposure to the virus, including one person who was showing symptoms of the virus and being tested.\nRamping up mask production  In an exclusive report, Reuters said President Trump was considering using the Defense Production Act to quickly ramp up domestic manufacturing of protective masks and clothing, two officials told the news agency.\n  The news comes the same day a whistleblower from the US Department of Health and Human Services said federal workers who met planes of evacuees from Wuhan were not donning personal protective gear and were not trained in public health emergency protocols.\n  The Washington Post published a heavily redacted account of the whistleblower's report. The whistleblower is seeking federal protection, and says she was improperly reassigned after raising her concerns.\nUS vaccine makers take on COVID-19 Altimmune announced today advancement toward the development of a single-dose intranasal COVID-19 vaccine.\n  \"With the spread of COVID-19 outside of China, including the first case of unknown origin in the United States, we have taken action to develop and make our vaccine technology available to help address this crisis,\" said Vipin K. Garg, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Altimmune in a press release. \"We believe that our intranasal vaccine technology is especially well suited to provide systemic protection against respiratory infections that affect the upper and lower airways and can therefore be a useful tool in preventing further spread of COVID-19.\"\n  The new vaccine is based on the same platform vaccine technology as NasoVax, the company's influenza vaccine candidate.\nInovio Pharmaceuticals Inc., meanwhile, is looking to pair with a large drug maker on COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Innovio said the company would like to produce 1 million doses of a vaccine by the end of the year, but it needs to partner with a bigger company to meet that goal.",

It marks the first time since the outbreak began that no new confirmed cases were reported over a 7-day period.\n  The most recent case was reported in Beni health zone in North Kivu province on Feb 17. The death toll in the outbreak, which has lasted 18 months in the eastern region of the DRC, remains at 2,264. The overall case fatality rate is 66%.\n  The WHO said that while the lack of new confirmed cases reported in the last week is a major achievement, the outbreak remains active. The risk of additional cases emerging remains high, the agency noted, and transmission of the virus outside of groups currently under surveillance cannot be excluded. In addition, Ebola persists in some survivors' bodily fluids and can infect others.\n  \"To mitigate a potential resurgence of the outbreak, it is critical to maintain response capacities to rapidly detect and respond to any new cases and to prioritize survivor support and monitoring and the maintenance of cooperative relationships with the survivors' associations,\" the WHO said.\n  The WHO also said that more funding will be needed to continue fighting the outbreak. The agency said it has some carryover funding to maintain operations through this month, but that $40 million is needed \"to ensure continuity of activities to bring the case incidence to zero and to continue building strong and resilient health systems.\"\nFeb 27 WHO Ebola update\nCDC surveillance estimates nearly 23,000 US candidemia cases  A population-based surveillance study estimates that there were nearly 23,000 cases of candidemia in the United States in 2017, researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and several state health departments reported today in Clinical Infectious Diseases.\n  The surveillance, conducted in 45 counties in 9 states through the CDC's Emerging Infections Program, identified 1,226 cases of candidemia\u2014a bloodstream infection caused by species of the fungus Candida\u2014in 1,140 patients in 2017. The all-cause mortality rate within 7 days of candidemia diagnosis was 15%, and 25% for the entire hospitalization. Based on this, the researchers estimated that 22,600 US candidemia cases occurred in 2017, with an estimated 3,380 deaths within 7 days and 5,628 deaths during the entire hospital stay.\n  The overall estimated incidence of candidemia was 7.0 cases per 100,000 people, with the highest rates in adults 65 and older (20.1/100,000), men (7.9/100,000), and African Americans (12.3/100,000).\n  This is the first estimate of the burden of candidemia in the United States. The authors of the study say that since candidemia is only one form of invasive candidiasis, the true burden of invasive infections caused by Candida species is likely higher. They also noted that changes in the burden and epidemiology of candidemia may occur in the near future as Candida auris, which was first identified in the United States in 2016, continues to emerge as a major healthcare-associated pathogen.  \nFeb 28 Clin Infect Dis abstract",

When compared with the 2020 Southern Hemisphere vaccine strains, only the influenza B Victoria lineage is the same. The team also assessed the latest zoonotic flu viruses and didn't recommend any new candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness.\n  Extensive strain selection changes have sometimes led to delays in flu vaccine production. The committee meets again in September to recommend the strains to include in the Southern Hemisphere's 2021 flu season.\nFeb 28 WHO recommendations for 2020-21 strains\nFeb 28 WHO zoonotic flu vaccine virus assessment\nSep 27, 2019, CIDRAP News story \"Two strains changed for Southern Hemisphere 2020 flu vaccine\"\n\nCDC notes drop in flu activity, but kids' deaths climb to 125  For the second week in a row, US flu levels dropped last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today in its weekly FluView report.\n  Though regions are still experiencing elevated influenza activity, several indicators showed flu activity was declining. However, 20 more pediatric deaths were recorded, raising the 2019-20 flu season total to 125, compared with 144 for all of last season.\n  Rates of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) dropped last week, to 5.5%, compared with the previous week's 6.1%. The percentage of specimens positively identified as influenza also dropped slightly, from 29.6% to 26.4%.\n  The number of jurisdictions reporting high ILI activity was 43 states and New York City and Puerto Rico. The number of jurisdictions reporting regional or widespread flu remained at 48.\n  \"Overall, hospitalization rates remain similar to this time during recent seasons, but rates among school aged children and young adults are higher at this time than in recent seasons and rates among children 0-4 years old are now the highest CDC has on record at this point in the season, surpassing rates reported during the second wave of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic,\" the CDC said.\n  The cumulative hospitalization rate rose from 47.4 per 100,000 population, to 52.7 per 100,000.\n  Public health labs confirmed that 72.4%% of positive specimens were influenza A and 27.6% were influenza B. Of the subtyped influenza A specimens, 94.8% were 2009 H1N1, and 5.2% were H3N2. Influenza B/Victoria accounted for 99.3% of B viruses detected.\nFeb 28 CDC FluView \n\nChildren derive significant protection from flu vaccines, review finds  A systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 studies of flu vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization in children published yesterday in Vaccine found overall VE of 57.5% and VE against H1N1 of 74.1%, H3N2 of 40.8%, and influenza B of 50.9%.\n  The study, led by Brown University researchers, compared the findings of test-negative design trials from 2005 to 2019 that estimated flu VE with laboratory-confirmed flu-related hospitalizations in children 6 months to 17 years old.\n  The researchers found that flu vaccine conferred significant protection against any type of flu-related hospitalization (57.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 49.5% to 65.5). VE was high against H1N1 (74.1%; 95% CI, 54.9% to 93.3%) and moderate against influenza B (50.9%; 95% CI, 41.8% to 60.0%) and H3N2 (40.8%; 95% CI, 25.7% to 55.9%). Flu VE was 61.7% in children younger than 5 years (95% CI, 49.3% to 74.1%) and 54.4% in those 6 to 17 years (95% CI, 35.1% to 73.6%). And flu vaccination conferred significantly higher protection in fully vaccinated children (61.8%; 95% CI, 54.5% to 69.1%) than in those only partially vaccinated (33.9%; 95% CI, 21.1% to 46.7%).\n  While vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the flu, VE varies by year in part because of circulating seasonal flu strains' antigenic variability and their match with the vaccine strains. Children, particularly those younger than 5 years, and older adults are at highest risk for flu-related complications, hospitalizations, and death. Children also tend to introduce and spread the virus at home and in the community, the authors note.\nFeb 27 Vaccine abstract",

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "By Vincent Racaniello\n\nHealth experts say it\u2019s not a question of whether SARS-CoV-2 will spread within the U.S., but when. A CDC official said yesterday, \u201cWe are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad.\u201d What exactly does that mean?\n\nThe CDC assessment is based on a number of indicators. While the number of diagnosed infections has decreased in China, they have gone up elsewhere. Now for the first time in this epidemic there are more infections being diagnosed daily outside of China than inside of the country. There are infections in new countries that previously did not have any. And the number of infections in certain countries, like South Korea, Italy, and Iran, have increased substantially.\n\nThe increase in diagnosed cases outside of China is consistent with community spread of the infection. The infection is spreading undetected, from people with minimal or no symptoms who are shedding virus. Yesterday the first US case was diagnosed in California in an individual with no travel history or contact with a sick person, a classic example of community transmission.\n\nHere we have a virus for which 80% of infections are mild, and likely many more have no symptoms at all. These individuals do not seek medical care and remain undiagnosed. However they are capable of spreading infection.\n\nFor all these reasons I feel that excessive concern over SARS-CoV-2 infection is unwarranted. As I wrote above, 80% of infections elsewhere so far have been mild, and it is largely those over 60 who develop serious disease. In contrast, there have been 15,000,000 flu infections and 7,000 deaths this year in the US. No one is worried about those, as only half the population is taking the flu vaccine.\n\nMany people are scared by the \u2018apparent\u2019 2.3% case fatality ratio. This number is calculated by dividing the number of fatal cases by the total number of diagnosed cases. However, as shown in the table below, the number varies according to age. In those 49 years of age or younger, the case fatality ratio is less than 1%. Furthermore, the number of diagnosed cases is likely to be vastly underestimated. Many mild or asymptomatic infections are not diagnosed. It is possible that the number of infections is actually ten times higher than we detect, which would bring the overall case fatality ratio in the neighborhood of seasonal flu. As I said above, there is little concern about that disease.\n\n\n\nSource: China CDC Weekly\n\nNo one knows when the virus will arrive in force in the US. It\u2019s amazing that we have had less than 100 cases so far. But if it comes to the US it will spread because we won\u2019t have the movement restrictions that were put in place in China.\n\nWhat I am worried about is that the administration is not helping the situation. They seem utterly unprepared. Trump has said \u201cI think it\u2019s gonna work out fine,\u201d and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said that U.S. containment of the virus is \u201cpretty close to airtight.\u201d These statements are uninformed.\n\nUntil two days ago, no single official has been put in charge of organizing the government\u2019s response. To make matters worse, in 2018, Trump fired the pandemic response chain of command that the Obama administration set up to address the Ebola outbreak. There is no bureaucracy to coordinate various federal agencies and local responses. This past fall, Trump shut down Predict, a federal program that tracked and researched pandemics.\n\nI would say that the U.S. is less prepared for the SARS-CoV-2019 outbreak than we\u2019ve ever been.\n\nTo make matters even worse, Trump has appointed Vice President Mike Pence coronavirus czar. Here is a man who doesn\u2019t believe in science leading the government\u2019s response. Furthermore, while governor of Indiana, Pence fueled the worst HIV outbreak in the state\u2019s history when he ignored the advice of state and federal health officials. He has denied that smoking kills, spread disinformation about condoms, and called global warming a \u201cmyth.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t think any of this is a problem, listen to the press conference as Trump says \u2018there are 15 cases, then there will be zero\u201d. Then in the same press conference, PHS officials talk about \u2018pandemic preparedness\u2019. It is simply inappropriate and an embarrassment. I think the inherent danger of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is not excessive, but it might be in the hands of an inactive administration.\n\nIn meantime, I would advise you to ignore the rumors on social media and stick to the facts. Listen to TWiV or read The WHO and CDC websites. Wash your hands often, as the virus is transmitted via mucus (we all touch our nose, eyes and mouth frequently). Stay away from sick people and keep a safe distance from others (respiratory aerosols, which carry the virus, fall to the ground quickly). And if you are sick, please stay home from work and call your health care professional for advice.\n\n\nhttp://www.virology.ws/2020/02/27/sa...uld-it-be-bad/",

No underground bunkers, no 10-year-supply of freeze dried foods, or an armory befitting of a small Latin American country.\nAnd all things you should have and do all of the time.  \nIn 2014, when Ebola raged across Africa, and the first few cases showed up in the United States, I wrote An Appropriate Level Of Concern Over Ebola In The US.  I wrote:\nGiven that I write about emergency preparedness often, I\u2019m getting a lot of inquires - from friends and readers alike - as to what I\u2019m doing to prepare now that Ebola has reached the United States. Rather than deal with this question a hundred times over, I\u2019ll lay it out here.\n\nNothing special. That is, nothing I wouldn\u2019t be doing anyway. \nEbola isn't airborne, it isn't transmissible until after symptoms appeared. It was never going to spread massively in the United States, no matter how much the notion was hyped by an excitable press.\n\nBut we live in a dangerous world, where earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods . . . and even more mundane events like auto accidents, or slips and falls at home . . . can ruin your entire day.\nAnd pandemic or not, these things are going to continue to happen. The only difference is, dealing with an earthquake, a hurricane, or a flood during a pandemic becomes that much harder.  \nThe standard advice I give in this blog several dozen times a year still applies. We may need to add a few tweaks for a pandemic, but if you are already prepared for a natural disaster (see below), you are 90% prepared to deal with a pandemic.\n\nWhere you live, and your local threat environment, will dictate some changes, but as a general rule, the things you should have in advance to deal with any disaster or emergency include:A battery operated NWS Emergency Radio to find out what was going on, and to get vital instructions from emergency officials\nA decent first-aid kit, so that you can treat injuries\nEnough non-perishable food and water on hand to feed and hydrate your family (including pets) for the duration\nA way to provide light when the grid is down.\nA way to cook safely without electricity\nA way to purify or filter water\nA way to stay cool (fans) or warm when the power is out.\nA small supply of cash to use in case credit/debit machines are not working\nAn emergency plan, including meeting places, emergency out-of-state contact numbers, a disaster buddy, and in case you must evacuate, a bug-out bag\nSpare supply of essential prescription medicines that you or your family may need\nA way to entertain yourself, or your kids, during a prolonged blackout or shelter-in-place\nWhile some of this is more appropriate to a hurricane or an earthquake than a pandemic, you can't know in advance what challenges you and your family might face in an emergency. The goal is to be reasonably prepared to deal with a wide range of problems.\n\nIn last September's #NatlPrep: Personal Pandemic Preparedness, we looked at the things that individuals and families should do to prepare for a pandemic, as recommended by the CDC, FEMA.gov, and Ready.gov.\nThis advice from Ready.gov.\nPandemic\nBefore a PandemicStore a two week supply of water and food.\nPeriodically check your regular prescription drugs to ensure a continuous supply in your home.\nHave any nonprescription drugs and other health supplies on hand, including pain relievers, stomach remedies, cough and cold medicines, fluids with electrolytes, and vitamins.\nGet copies and maintain electronic versions of health records from doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and other sources and store them, for personal reference. Get help accessing electronic help records.\nTalk with family members and loved ones about how they would be cared for if they got sick, or what will be needed to care for them in your home.\n To all of this, I would add (one or more) `Flu buddies'  (see Time To Line Up A `Flu Buddy'), a copious supply of hand sanitizer, and if you can find them, a box of surgical masks (to wear if you are symptomatic, not for `casual wear' in public). \n\nAdmittedly, COVID-19 looks to be much more serious than the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, and I expect that societal disruptions to be far greater. A modicum of personal preparedness undertaken now could go a long ways towards making those disruptions more palatable, and could even be lifesaving.\nLike it or not, dealing with fallout from COVID-19 in the months ahead isn't going to optional for any of us.\n The better prepared we are going into this - as individuals, families, businesses, and communities - the more likely we are to limit its impact.\n\nhttps://afludiary.blogspot.com/2020/...-personal.html",

Trump was flanked by several public health officials, including Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar, CDC Director Robert Redfield, MD, CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat, MD, and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director Anthony Fauci, MD.\nOverplayed threat?  On Twitter this morning the president suggested the media were overplaying the threats of the virus.\n  \"Low Ratings Fake News MSDNC (Comcast) & @CNN are doing everything possible to make the Caronavirus [sic] look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible. Likewise their incompetent Do Nothing Democrat comrades are all talk, no action. USA in great shape,\" he said.\n  Sixty Americans have been diagnosed as having the disease to date, with almost two-thirds connected to the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was quarantined in Japan.\n  \"The level we have had is very low, and of the 15 people, 8 returned home, 5 have fully recovered, 1 is in hospital, and 1 is in pretty good shape,\" said Trump. The 15 cases he referred to were Americans who had contracted the virus through travel and close case contact, not the 45 Americans who have been repatriated with the disease, 42 of them from the Diamond Princess.\n  \"Our president took unprecedented steps to protect Americans from the disease, including aggressive quarantine, and travel restrictions,\" said Pence, former Indiana governor. \"My role will be to continue to bring the task force together. We will also be continuing to reach out to governors.\"\n  Azar said he was \"delighted\" with Pences appointment, adding that Trump's decision to restrict travel from China in January allowed the United States to buy \"valuable time\" to prepare for COVID-19.\n  Azar also laid out several key priorities for the task force, including expanding surveillance, supporting state governments, developing therapeutics and vaccines, and buying personal protective equipment for hospital workers.\nTrump compares COVID-19 to flu  President Trump remained optimistic and resolute throughout the press conference, reminding people that the flu kills more than 20,000 Americans each year, and saying he believes cases in China have gone down in the last few days.\n  \"We will essentially have a flu shot for this very soon,\" said Trump. \"View this the same as the flu.\"\n  Fauci, however, clarified that a vaccine would take several months to develop, and would not be ready for use for at least another year to 18 months.\n  Trump also said money would not be a concern. \"We're going to spend whatever is appropriate; we have had tremendous success,\" he said.\nExperts underscore low testing rate  Marc Lipsitch, PhD, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, watched the press conference. He was encouraged by Trump\u2019s naming of Pence, and said Azar listed positive priorities.\n  \"There was a lot of good news. I hope the appointment of someone who will listen to experts is a good sign,\" Lipstich said, referring to Pence. He warned, however, that the 15 cases cited by Trump as evidence of limited transmission in the country are more reflective of limited testing.\n  Michael T. Osterholm, MPH, PhD, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, which publishes CIDRAP News, echoed Lipsitch's concern.\n  \"There are so few cases because there are so few tests being done,\" he said. Osterholm said the CDC's message in the last few days has been on the mark, and he was happy to see that money is moving through Congress to address the threat of COVID-19.\n  \"We should all be on one team,\" Osterholm said. \"This should not be political; we are all against the virus.\"\n  Osterholm also shed additional light on vaccine development. \"What has been happening is people are confused between a vaccine for research versus a licensed vaccine for commercial use. A licensed product is years off, not months off.\"\nPossible community spread in California  During the press conference, the CDC confirmed via a media email a new COVID-19 case in California, in a person who did not have relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient with COVID-19.\n  \"It's possible this could be an instance of community spread of COVID-19, which would be the first time this has happened in the United States,\" the CDC said. \"Community spread means spread of an illness for which the source of infection is unknown. It's also possible, however, that the patient may have been exposed to a returned traveler who was infected. \"\n  Yesterday San Francisco Mayor London Breed declared a state of emergency in that city to prepare for coronavirus. It is not known at this time if the new case was detected in San Francisco.",

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "FDA STATEMENT Coronavirus (COVID-19) Supply Chain Update\nFor Immediate Release: For Immediate Release:\nFebruary 27, 2020 \tStatement From: \tCommissioner of Food and Drugs - Food and Drug Administration\n\tStephen M. Hahn M.D. \nAs I have previously communicated, the FDA has been closely monitoring the supply chain with the expectation that the COVID-19 outbreak would likely impact the medical product supply chain, including potential disruptions to supply or shortages of critical medical products in the U.S.\n\nA manufacturer has alerted us to a shortage of a human drug that was recently added to the drug shortages list. The manufacturer just notified us that this shortage is related to a site affected by coronavirus. The shortage is due to an issue with manufacturing of an active pharmaceutical ingredient used in the drug. It is important to note that there are other alternatives that can be used by patients. We are working with the manufacturer as well as other manufacturers to mitigate the shortage. We will do everything possible to mitigate the shortage. Additional Information on Human DrugsSince January 24, the FDA has been in touch with more than 180 manufacturers of human drugs, not only to remind them of applicable legal requirements for notifying the FDA of any anticipated supply disruptions, but also asking them to evaluate their entire supply chain, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (the main ingredient in the drug and part that produces the intended effects, e.g., acetaminophen) and other components manufactured in China.\n\nAlso, as part of our efforts, the FDA has identified about 20 other drugs, which solely source their active pharmaceutical ingredients or finished drug products from China. We have been in contact with those firms to assess whether they face any drug shortage risks due to the outbreak. None of these firms have reported any shortage to date. Also, these drugs are considered non-critical drugs.\n\nWe will remain in contact with manufacturers so that we can continue to assist them with any potential issues in the fastest way. Medical DevicesWe are aware of 63 manufacturers which represent 72 facilities in China that produce essential medical devices; we have contacted all of them. Essential devices are those that may be prone to potential shortage if there is a supply disruption. We are aware that several of these facilities in China are adversely affected by COVID-19, citing workforce challenges, including the necessary quarantine of workers. While the FDA continues to assess whether manufacturing disruptions will affect overall market availability of these products, there are currently no reported shortages for these types of medical devices within the U.S. market.\n\nRegarding personal protective equipment\u2014surgical gowns, gloves, masks, respirator protective devices, or other medical equipment designed to protect the wearer from injury or the spread of infection or illness\u2014the FDA has heard reports of increased market demand and supply challenges for some of these products. However, the FDA is currently not aware of specific widespread shortages of medical devices, but we are aware of reports from CDC and other U.S. partners of increased ordering of a range of human medical products through distributors as some healthcare facilities in the U.S. are preparing for potential needs if the outbreak becomes severe.\n\nIt is important to note that no law exists requiring medical device manufacturers to notify the FDA when they become aware of a circumstance, including discontinuation of a product, that could lead to a potential shortage, and manufacturers are not required to respond when the FDA requests information about potential supply chain disruption. As with prior emergencies, the FDA has taken proactive steps to establish and remain in contact with medical device manufacturers and others in the supply chain, including hospitals and group purchasing organizations. The agency also encourages manufacturers and healthcare facilities to report any supply disruptions to the device shortages mailbox, deviceshortages@fda.hhs.gov. This mailbox is closely monitored and has proven to be a valuable surveillance resource to augment FDA efforts to detect and mitigate potential supply chain disruption.  Biologics and Blood SupplyThe FDA is not aware of any cellular or gene therapies that are made in China for the U.S. market. There are no shortages of biologics to report at this time.\n\nThe potential for transmission of COVID-19 by blood and blood components is unknown at this time; however, respiratory viruses, in general, are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion. Further, there have been no reported cases of transfusion-transmitted COVID-19.\n\nThe FDA has made information available to blood establishments and to establishments that manufacture human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products that may wish to consider additional donor screening measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. FoodWe are not aware of any reports at this time of human illnesses that suggest COVID-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging. However, it is always important to follow good hygiene practices (i.e., wash hands and surfaces often, separate raw meat from other foods, cook to the right temperature, and refrigerate foods promptly) when handling or preparing foods.  Animal DrugsThere are 32 animal drug firms that make finished drugs or source active pharmaceutical ingredients in China for the U.S. The FDA has contacted all 32 firms and no shortages have been reported at this time. However, six of those firms have indicated that they are seeing disruptions in the supply chain that soon could lead to shortages. The FDA is working with these firms to help identify interventions to mitigate potential shortages. Additional ResourcesThe FDA is using all our existing authorities to address COVID-19, and we welcome the opportunity to work with Congress to further strengthen our response capabilities and emergency preparedness. There are four specific proposals included in the President\u2019s budget that would better equip the FDA to prevent or mitigate medical product shortages.Lengthen Expiration Dates to Mitigate Critical Human Drug Shortages: Shortages of certain critical drugs can be exacerbated when drugs must be discarded because they exceed a labeled shelf-life due to unnecessarily short expiration dates. By expanding the FDA\u2019s authority to require, when likely to help prevent or mitigate a shortage, that an applicant evaluate, submit studies to the FDA, and label a product with the longest possible expiration date that the FDA agrees is scientifically justified, there could be more supply available to alleviate the drug shortage or the severity of a shortage.\nImprove Critical Infrastructure by Requiring Risk Management Plans: Enabling the FDA to require application holders of certain drugs to conduct periodic risk assessments to identify the vulnerabilities in their manufacturing supply chain (inclusive of contract manufacturing facilities), and develop plans to mitigate the risks associated with the identified vulnerabilities would enable the FDA to strengthen the supply chain by integrating contingencies for emergency situations. Currently, many medical product manufacturers lack plans to assess and address vulnerabilities in their manufacturing supply chain, putting them, and American patients, at risk for drug supply disruptions following disasters (e.g., hurricanes) or in other circumstances.\nImprove Critical Infrastructure through Improved Data Sharing and Require More Accurate Supply Chain Information: Empowering the FDA to require information to assess critical infrastructure, as well as manufacturing quality and capacity, would facilitate more accurate and timely supply chain monitoring and improve our ability to recognize shortage signals.\nEstablish Reporting Requirements for Device Manufacturers: The FDA does not have the same authorities for medical device shortages as it does for drugs and biological products. For instance, medical device manufacturers are not required to notify the FDA when they become aware of a circumstance that could lead to a device shortage or meaningful disruption in the supply of that device in the U.S., nor are they required to respond to inquiries from the FDA about the availability of devices. Enabling the FDA to have timely and accurate information about likely or confirmed national shortages of essential devices would allow the agency to take steps to promote the continued availability of devices of public health importance. Among other things, the FDA proposes to require that firms notify the agency of an anticipated meaningful interruption in the supply of an essential device; require all manufacturers of devices determined to be essential to periodically provide the FDA with information about the manufacturing capacity of the essential devices they manufacture; and authorize the temporary importation of devices where the benefits of the device in mitigating a shortage outweigh the risks presented by the device that could otherwise result in denial of importation of the device into the U.S.\n\nOverall, this remains an evolving and very dynamic issue. We are committed to continuing to communicate with the public as we have further updates.\n\nWe also continue to aggressively monitor the market for any firms marketing products with fraudulent COVID-19 diagnosis, prevention or treatment claims. The FDA can and will use every authority at our disposal to protect consumers from bad actors who take advantage of a crisis to deceive the public, including pursuing warning letters, seizures or injunctions against products on the market that are not in compliance with the law, or against firms or individuals who violate the law.\n\nWe know the public may have questions or concerns for the FDA as a result of this outbreak, including you and your family\u2019s risk of exposure, or whether your critical medical products are safe and will continue to be available in the future. The FDA is working around the clock to monitor and mitigate emerging coronavirus issues through collaborative efforts with federal partners, international regulators and medical product developers and manufacturers to help advance response efforts to combat the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation\u2019s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\n\n### Inquiries  Media: \t Stephanie Caccomo \t 301-348-1956 Consumer: \t 888-INFO-FDA\nhttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/pres...y-chain-update",

It also reported 1 more death, lifting that total to 13. For comparison, China today reported 433 new cases, putting its total at 78,497, along with 29 more deaths (2,744 total), marking a notable decline in daily fatality reports.\n  In a snapshot of the first 1,595 Korean cases, the KCDC said 52.9% are related to Shincheonji Church of Jesus and Qingdao University Hospital clusters. Elsewhere, an investigation is under way into an outbreak at St Mary's Hospital in Seoul that has sickened 11 people. Also, health officials are tracking contacts of a Korean Airlines crew member who worked on a flight that carried infected Holy Land travelers and on a flight from Los Angeles to South Korea.\n  Meanwhile, in outbreak response developments, some local South Korean governments have launched drive-through COVID-19 health checks and testing, several media outlets have reported. Officials have said the drive-through stops can cut testing time by a third and cut the risk of infection by avoiding long waits at crowded clinics.\n  Also, the United States and South Korea have postponed a military drill over coronavirus concerns, CNN reported today. So far, 25 infections have been reported in South Korean troops and in 1 US soldier.\n  In other Asian developments:Japan today reported 23 more cases, raising its total to 191, though it notes 210 overall cases that include 19 asymptomatic carriers. One of the newly confirmed patients is a Yokohama quarantine staff member, a development related to the Diamond Princess cruise ship cluster. Fifteen of the new cases are from Hokkaido and the others are from Gifu, Ishikawa, Kanagawa, Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya. Also today, Japan announced the closure of all schools (kindergarten through high school) nationwide until April to help slow the spread of the virus, according to media reports.\nSingapore today reported 3 more cases, increasing its total to 96. Two are linked to earlier cases, and contact tracing is still under way to determine exposure for the third.\nItalian outbreak surges, fuels more cases in Europe  Since yesterday, Italy reported 276 more cases, raising its total to 650, with seven new European countries reporting their first cases, all linked to Italy or Iran, and several more already affected European countries reporting more Italy-linked cases.\n  Italy's health ministry today said most of the new cases are from the three hard-hit northern regions: Lombardy, Veneto, and Emilia-Romagna. Of the total, 248 people are hospitalized, 56 of them in intensive care.\n  The country also reported 5 more deaths today, raising its fatality count to 17.\n  Elsewhere in Europe, four countries reported their first cases, all linked to Italy: Denmark, North Macedonia, the Netherlands, and Romania.\n  Also, three other European countries reported their first cases linked to other countries. Norway reported its first case, which involves a traveler from China, and Estonia reported its first case, which involved an Iranian citizen who traveled by bus via Latvia. Also, Georgia reported its first case in a citizen who was traveling from Iran and crossed the border from Azerbaijan.\n  Other previously affected European countries reported more infections, including:France's total jumped from 18 to 38 over the past day, mostly owing to detections in contacts of earlier cases, Reuters reported, citing the country's health ministry. Two deaths have been reported.\nSwitzerland today reported 3 more cases, 1 involving a patient in Geneva who had traveled to Milan, Italy, and 2 from Grisons canton in the east of the country with unspecified exposures. The country now has 4 cases.\nGreece today confirmed a second case-patient, the child of its first confirmed patient, marking the country's first local transmission. The detection prompted the 14-day closure of a primary school as a precaution.\nUK officials today reported 2 new cases, including a patient exposed in Italy and another who contracted the virus on the Spanish island of Tenerife, raising the country's total to 15.\nSpain reported its first locally acquired case today and reported at least 2 others, both with Milan links, raising its total to 17, El Pais reported today.\nSweden yesterday reported a new case linked to Italy and announced 5 more in three locations today with unspecified sources, raising its total to 7.\nGermany confirmed 5 more infections since yesterday, raising its total to 26. The government has activated a crisis team and said it's not clear if transmission chains can be broken.\nCroatia reported 3 more cases, including 2 linked to Italy travel, according to a local media report.\nIran total passes 100, with further Mideast expansion  Iran today reported 106 more cases and 7 more deaths, raising its total to 245 cases, 26 of them fatal. Several already-affected Middle Eastern countries reported more mostly travel-linked cases, and Saudi Arabia today announced that travelers from countries where the COVID-19 virus is spreading will be barred from making religious pilgrimages, such as the Umrah in Mecca.\n  Countries in the region reporting more cases include:Iraq has 1 more case, a patient in Baghdad who had traveled to Iraq, raising the country's total to 6.\nKuwait today reported 18 more, raising its total to 43. All had returned from Iran, Anadolu Agency reported, citing the country's health ministry.\nBahrain has 7 more cases, raising its total to 33, according to numbers reflected in a World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean office tweet.\nOman reported 1 more infection, reported in an Iran traveler, raising its total to 5, Oman News Agency\nUnited Arab Emirates reported 6 new cases in people of three different nationalities, all of whom had Iran travel, raising the country's total to 19, Gulf News reported today.\nLebanon today reported 1 new case, raising its total to 3, according to a health ministry Facebook post.",

Gastric acid suppressants are also associated with increased risk of Clostridioides difficile infection, and previous studies have found links with rectal carriage of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\nSignificant association found  The review and meta-analysis looked at 26 observational studies published from 1996 through 2019 that involved 29,382 participants, 38.9% of whom were acid suppressant users. The selected studies, which included cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies, all investigated the association between acid suppression and risk of intestinal MDRO colonization.\n  Target pathogens included multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae (carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), carbapenemases, and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and MDR Pseudomonas or Acinetobactor species.\n  A primary analysis of 12 studies that were adjusted for confounding factors found that the odds ratio (OR) for intestinal colonization with MDR Enterobacteriaceae or VRE among acid suppressant users was 1.74 (95% CI, 1.40 to 2.16). A secondary analysis of all 26 studies produced similar results (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.44 to 1.99). Further analysis based on the type of study design and setting produced similar results.\n  The analysis also found that the risk of MDRO colonization associated with PPI use (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.52 to 2.16) was larger than the risk associated with H2RAs (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.86 to 2.08), which was not surprising given that PPIs are more potent acid suppressants. But the researchers note that only 4 studies involved H2RA use, while 17 involved PPIs).\nPossible explanations  While the authors of the paper caution that the findings are observational and patients who use acid suppressing medications may have other risk factors for MDRO colonization, they lay out three explanations for how these drugs could facilitate intestinal MDRO colonization.\n  One explanation is that the reduction of gastric acid, which kills all organisms that enter the stomach, may enable MDR bacteria to survive and move on to the intestinal tract. Another is that PPIs and H2RAs can alter the composition of the intestinal microbiota in ways that allow for resistant bacteria to take root.\n  Finally, some MDROs, in particular certain strains of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, have been found to contain amino acid substitutions that confer resistance to gastric acid.\n  The authors of the paper say the findings, along with other associated adverse effects observed in other studies, are a reason for clinicians to be cautious with prescribing acid suppressants. They note that 50% to 70% of PPI use has been found to be inappropriate, with patients either not having an identifiable reason for taking them or taking them for much longer than is necessary.\n  \"We advocate that acid suppressants should be used when necessary but that unnecessary use should be avoided,\" they wrote.\n  They also suggest that promoting rational use of acid suppressants could interact favorably with infection control and antibiotic stewardship efforts.\n  In an accompanying commentary, Todd Lee, MD, MPH, and Emily McDonald, MD, of McGill University in Montreal, say the findings provide another reason clinicians should avoid prescribing PPIs to patients who don't need them, and assess whether patients who are taking them long term still need to be taking them.\n  \"For most patients receiving PPIs long term, at least an annual reassessment for an ongoing requirement or benefit is reasonable,\" they wrote.\nSee also:\n  Mar 29, 2017, CIDRAP News story \"Heartburn drugs tied to higher risk of recurrent C diff\"",

This raises the number of MERS cases recorded this month to 12.\n  The case involves an 80-year-old man from Hail whose exposure to MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) is listed as primary, meaning it is unlikely he contracted the virus from another person. The MOH said the man was not a healthcare worker and had unknown camel contact, a known risk factor for MERS.\n  The World Health Organization said that, since 2012, it has received reports of 2,519 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases, with 866 associated deaths. The vast majority of these cases have been in Saudi Arabia.\nFeb 27 Saudi MOH report\n\nCDC says 14 ill in 5 states from E coli traced to Jimmy John's sprouts  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) yesterday says at least 14 people are ill in a multistate outbreak linked to eating Escherichia coli-tainted clover sprouts on Jimmy John's sandwiches.\n  \"The CDC is concerned that people who recently ate clover sprouts on a sandwich from a Jimmy John's restaurant before February 24th could develop an E coli O103 infection,\" said officials in a Food Safety Alert.\n  Officials have confirmed that 14 people in five states were infected with the outbreak strain, with illnesses beginning from Jan 6 to Feb 11. No hospitalizations or deaths have been reported, according to the CDC. Patients range in age from 1 to 79 years, with a median age of 28. Illinois reported 6 cases, following by Iowa (3), Utah (3), and Missouri and Texas with 1 each.\n  On Feb 21, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sent a warning letter to Jimmy John's President, James North, demanding a list of steps the chain has or will take to prevent the situation from happening again.\n  Consumers are advised to talk to their healthcare provider, report their illness to their local health department, cooperate with public health investigators, dispose of any leftovers of their sandwich, and wash their hands after using the toilet and before and after preparing food. Symptoms usually begin 2 to 8 days after ingesting the bacteria.\n  The outbreak strain of E coli can cause severe stomach cramps, bloody diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and a type of sometimes fatal kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Antibiotics are not recommended for patients with E coli because their efficacy is unproven, and they may increase the risk of HUS.\n  Jimmy John's reported that all of its restaurants stopped offering clover sprouts on Feb 24. The investigation into whether the tainted sprouts were served at other restaurants or retailers is ongoing, according to the CDC.\nFeb 26 CDC Food Safety Alert\nFeb 26 CIDRAP News scan \"FDA warns Jimmy John's after recent E coli, Salmonella outbreaks\"\nACIP recommends Ebola vaccinations for at-risk healthcare workers  Healthcare and laboratory workers at risk of exposure to Ebola should be vaccinated against the virus, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted yesterday, according to MedPage Today.\n  Committee members voted 14-0 for vaccination against Ebola for healthcare workers at risk of exposure, including those responding to an outbreak, working at federally designated US Ebola treatment centers, and laboratory workers and other staff at US biosafety-level 4 facilities.\n  The FDA approved Merck's Ervebo single-dose, live, attenuated vaccine (rVSV-EBOV) for adults in December 2019.\n  The ACIP's Ebola working group said that the vaccine is optional; organizations must decide whether to recommend the vaccine, and pregnant women must decide whether the benefits outweigh the risks of a live vaccine. \"We would give a lot of guidance about how the decision was to be made,\" said ACIP member Sharon Frey, MD, of Saint Louis University School of Medicine in St. Louis.\n  ACIP recommendations are considered final only when published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\nFeb 26 MedPage Today meeting coverage\n\nStudy reports improved flu vaccination rates in kids with asthma  Modifying the electronic health record (EHR), using a vaccination tracking tool, and educating healthcare providers and families was associated with a more than quadrupling of flu vaccinations in children hospitalized with asthma, according to a study today in Pediatrics.\n  Led by scientists at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, the observational study measured an increase in flu vaccination coverage from 13% to 57% over 4 years. A successful pilot project also led to the creation of a hospital-wide vaccination tracking system and a nurse-driven vaccine protocol.\n  The researchers used serial \"plan-do-study-act\" cycles to implement the changes, which consisted of documenting flu vaccination status and using the EHR asthma order set and history and physical exam template. The changes were linked to an increase in documentation of flu vaccination status from 51% to 96% and increased the use of the order set and template.\n  Half of all eligible patients received flu vaccinations after the interventions were implemented, with rates increasing with each year. No adverse reactions to the vaccine were documented.\n  Children with asthma carry an increased burden of complications from influenza. Hospitalization is considered an ideal time to immunize them against flu, according to the researchers.\nFeb 27 Pediatrics abstract",

Swarms can travel up to 150 km (93 miles) a day and contain between 40-80 million locusts per square kilometre.\n\nIf left unchecked, the number of locusts in East Africa could explode 400-fold by June. That would devastate harvests in a region with more than 19 million hungry people, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has warned.\n\nUganda has deployed the military. Kenya has trained hundreds of youth cadets to spray. Lacking pesticides, some security forces in Somalia have shot anti-aircraft guns at swarms darkening the skies.\n\nEveryone is racing the rains expected in March: the next generation of larvae is already wriggling from the ground, just as farmers plant their seeds...\n\nRead more:  https://news.trust.org/item/20200227122340-3t5r8",

We entered the Wuhan isolation ward as the first batch of medical aid workers from Guangdong Province, China. The daily work we are doing is mainly focused on provision of oxygen, electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, tube care, airway management, ventilator debugging, central venous intubation, haemodialysis care, and basic nursing care such as disposal and disinfection...\n\nThe conditions and environment here in Wuhan are more difficult and extreme than we could ever have imagined. There is a severe shortage of protective equipment, such as N95 respirators, face shields, goggles, gowns, and gloves. The goggles are made of plastic that must be repeatedly cleaned and sterilised in the ward, making them difficult to see through. Due to the need for frequent hand washing, several of our colleagues' hands are covered in painful rashes. As a result of wearing an N95 respirator for extended periods of time and layers of protective equipment, some nurses now have pressure ulcers on their ears and forehead. When wearing a mask to speak with patients, our voices are muted, so we have to speak very loudly. Wearing four layers of gloves is abnormally clumsy and does not work\u2014we can't even open the packaging bags for medical devices, so giving patients injections is a huge challenge. In order to save energy and the time it takes to put on and take off protective clothing, we avoid eating and drinking for 2 hours before entering the isolation ward. Often, nurses' mouths are covered in blisters. Some nurses have fainted due to hypoglycaemia and hypoxia.\nIn addition to the physical exhaustion, we are also suffering psychologically...",

Knowing whether kids are innocent bystanders, getting infected if someone brings the virus into their households, or are in fact a population that is stealthily driving this epidemic, would give response planners critical ammunition to use in the battle against the virus.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake are decisions about policies that can be hugely disruptive to families and workplaces. Should schools be closed to slow spread when the virus enters new terrain, forcing parents to scramble for child care alternatives or stay home? Should long-term care facilities discourage families from bringing young children to visit grandparents or other aging relatives?\n\nThough the evidence to date suggests this virus doesn\u2019t inflict severe disease on children, there\u2019s reason to think kids may be helping to amplify transmission.

Some have even suggested that the experience with SARS in 2003 provides evidence for this assertion.\n\nThe short answer is that while we may expect modest declines in the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 in warmer, wetter weather and perhaps with the closing of schools in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it is not reasonable to expect these declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent.\n\nBefore making the positive case for my assertions, let me start by busting some myths...",

They also reported 52 more deaths and 374 fewer serious cases, putting those respective totals at 2,715 and 8,752.\n  Global COVID-19 totals have reached 81,322 cases and 2,770 deaths, according to a list curated by Johns Hopkins.\nItaly travel noted in Brazil infection  Italy's health ministry today reported 52 new cases, raising its total to 374. It also noted 2 more deaths, putting the fatality count at 12. All but 2 of the cases are from three northern regions: Lombardy, Veneto, and Emilia-Romagna.\n  In a related development, Brazil today reported its first case, marking the first confirmed appearance of the virus in South America. According to the country's health ministry, the patient is a 61-year-old man in Sao Paulo who had traveled to Italy's Lombardy region. An investigation is under way to identify the man's contacts, including ones at home, the hospital, and the airline he flew on. Today the WHO's Pan American Health Organization urged all countries in the region to brace for the appearance of new cases, based on the detection in Brazil.\n  Similarly, Algeria confirmed a case linked to Italy travel, marking the first known case in the WHO's African region, according to a statement yesterday from the WHO. (Egypt reported a case earlier this month, but it is in the WHO's eastern Mediterranean region.) The Algeria case involves an Italian citizen who arrived in the country on Feb 17.\n  Algeria is one of the 13 countries the WHO has prioritized for preparedness, because of its close links with China, and the agency said it is preparing to deploy an expert group to support Algerian authorities.\n  A health ministry statement said the Italian man, who has underlying health conditions, is from Milan and had been in southern Algeria.\n  Greece's health ministry today on Twitter reported the country's first case, involving a 38-year-old woman who is a Greek citizen. It said she had traveled to a populated area in northern Italy and that she is in good health and is being monitored by doctors in Thessaloniki.\n  Meanwhile, four already affected European countries reported more cases, mostly with links to Italy travel:France today reported 3 new cases, one of whom involving a person who made frequent trips to Italy's Lombardy region, France24 reported today, citing French health officials.

Fifteen cases were in Qom, the outbreak's epicenter, and 13 in other locations, including 4 in Tehran.\n  A new estimate from modeling experts in Canada suggests that Iran could have as many as 18,300 cases (range, 3,770 to 53,470). For their analysis, the mathematical modelers examined the first 43 cases reported in Iran in the middle of February, as well as the first 3 exported cases. They also factored in air travel connectivity between Iran and other countries. They estimated that the outbreak might have been under way for the past month and a half. When they reran the numbers with the newest exported cases, they estimated that Iran may have 11,520 to 41,280 cases.\n  The group warned that Iran's epidemic is concerning, not only to its citizens but to other countries, especially those with lower capacity to respond to outbreaks.\n  In a new development, Pakistan today reported its first two cases, according to a tweet from the health minister. One patient is a 22-year-old man from Karachi who had visited Iran, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported, citing a provincial health official.

Cell-cultured quadrivalent vaccines were not significantly more effective than egg-based quadrivalent vaccines, which had an RVE of 2.5% (95% CI, -2.4% to 7.3%).\n  \"We did not find major effectiveness differences between licensed vaccines used among the elderly during the 2018-19 season,\" the researchers wrote. \"Consistent with prior research, we found that the egg-based adjuvanted and high-dose vaccines were slightly more effective than the egg-based quadrivalent vaccines.\"\n  Previous studies in this age-group found a moderately higher RVE for HD influenza vaccines than standard-dose (SD) vaccines during most seasons. Research during the A(H3N2)-dominated 2017-18 season demonstrated a slightly higher RVE for the cell-cultured vaccine than the SD egg-based versions.\n  Nearly half a million influenza-related hospitalizations and 12,000 to 56,000 deaths occur each year in the United States, most in people 65 and older. Vaccination is the main tool to prevent flu, but its effectiveness in older people has been low during recent seasons, particularly in those in which H3N2 viruses dominated.\nFeb 26 J Infect Dis abstract\nFDA warns Jimmy John's after recent E coli, Salmonella outbreaks  The FDA last week warned Jimmy John's restaurants after identifying five outbreaks of Shiga toxin\u2013producing Escherichia coli and Salmonella in recent years linked to the sandwich chain's clover sprouts and cucumbers.\n  In a Feb 21 letter to Jimmy John's President James North, the agency says it detected the outbreaks along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local organizations. \"Taken together, these outbreaks, which spanned over the past seven years and impacted no fewer than seventeen states demonstrate the corporate-wide supplier control mechanisms you have in place for receiving fresh produce are inadequate,\" wrote William Weissinger, program division director of the FDA's Office of Human and Animal Foods.\n  In the latest outbreak, involving E coli infection, 20 of 22 people sickened in December 2019 reported eating at Jimmy John's restaurants in Iowa. In 2018, 8 of 10 people infected with Salmonella in Illinois and Wisconsin reported eating sprouts at the chain. In 2014, 11 of 19 cases of E coli in six states were traced to five Jimmy John's restaurants. In 2013, 8 people in Colorado were infected with E coli after eating cucumbers at the chain. In 2012, 23 of 29 people in 11 states infected with E coli had sprouts at Jimmy John's.\n  In May 2012, the letter states, the FDA met with North, who promised to buy clover sprouts from only a single supplier. However, \"documents from traceback investigations conducted by FDA, states and local partners demonstrate that in addition to [that supplier's] sprouts, Jimmy John's restaurants are using multiple other sources of sprouts,\" the letter noted.\n  The letter acknowledges that Jimmy John's parent company, Inspire Brands, destroyed all sprouts and sanitized its Iowa-based restaurants in December 2019. However, it asks for a list of steps that the company has or will take to prevent the sale of adulterated food at all of its restaurants. The chain has 15 days to file a written response.\n  CBS News reports that Jimmy John's stopped selling sprouts at all restaurants on Feb 24.\nFeb 21 FDA letter\nFeb 26 CBS News story",

The platform will collect data on resistant pathogens in humans, animals, and the environment, and disseminate vetted and analyzed reports to an international audience of subscribers in real time.\n  \"Antimicrobial resistant organisms have become major emerging pathogens of our era and ProMED-AMR will apply the same approaches to this problem as it has used so successfully in detecting and monitoring other emerging disease threats,\" ISID president Marc Mendelson, MBBS, PhD, said in a news release.\n  All information from the platform will be available free of charge.\nFeb 26 ISID news release\nStudy: Antibiotics fail in 22% of pneumonia outpatients  An analysis of US health insurance claims data has found that antibiotic treatment failure occurs in 22% of adult patients receiving outpatient care for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), a team of US researchers reported today in Open Forum Infectious Diseases.\n  For the retrospective cohort analysis, the researchers combed through data from the Marketscan commercial and Medicare supplemental databases to identify adults who were diagnosed and treated for CAP in the outpatient setting from 2011 through 2015 and received an antibiotic within 3 days of diagnosis. The primary outcome was antibiotic treatment failure, and secondary outcomes included 30-day all-cause mortality and CAP-related healthcare costs within the 30-day follow-up period.\n  A total of 251,947 unique patients met the criteria for the study. Their mean age was 52.2 years old, and 47.7% were men. The majority of patients were prescribed azithromycin (39.5%) or levofloxacin (36.9%). Overall, antibiotic treatment failure occurred in 22.1% of patients, but was higher in patients over 65 (25.7%, compared with 21.2% for adults aged 18 to 64). In both groups, treatment failure most frequently occurred with beta-lactam antibiotics. The most common type of treatment failure was a change to a new prescription.\n  Overall, all-cause mortality within 30 days of index treatment occurred in 7.6% of patients, but it was significantly higher in the antibiotic failure patients compared with the antibiotic success cohort (18.1% vs 4.6%), and the differences in 30-day mortality between antibiotic failure groups increased as a function of age. Mean 30-day CAP-related healthcare costs were also much higher in the patients who experienced treatment failure relative to those that did not ($2,140 vs. $54, respectively).\n  The authors of the study call the poor patient outcomes observed in patients who experienced antibiotic treatment failure \"both clinically relevant and highly concerning.\"\n  \"Collectively, our findings indicate significant shortcomings in the current treatment approach to managing patients with CAP in the outpatient setting, especially among those who are not responsive to initial therapy,\" they write. \"The results of this study also identify great opportunities to improve the clinical management plans, including appropriate allocation of healthcare resources to avoid adverse outcomes for patients with CAP.\"\nFeb 26 Open Forum Infect Dis abstract",

Depending on the results, patients will be given the support they need and rapid public health actions will be taken.\n  A programme of testing with a network of around 100 primary care sites across England will also complement the detection system in hospitals, so that both mild and more unwell cases can be found.\n  Professor Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director, Public Health England, said: We have taken a belt and braces approach throughout this outbreak. This new system is another important way we can help limit the impact of COVID-19 in the UK, as we continue to ensure we have the best possible intelligence to protect the public\u2019s health.\n There is no change in risk for the public but taking this preparatory step now will enable us to better detect and contain the spread of the virus. The UK\u2019s infection control procedures are world-leading, and the system we are announcing today further strengthens our response.\nThis process will not apply to patients meeting the current COVID-19 case definition, who will continue to be isolated and tested as appropriate, and test result times will not be affected.\n  PHE and the NHS have tried and tested surveillance systems in place to monitor and manage the spread of community transmission of seasonal influenza each year.",

A Sunday service at another church in Paya Lebar more than a week earlier. A Chinese New Year gathering at Mei Hwan Drive in Serangoon. \n\nThree seemingly separate events that bore no apparent link to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases here, much less to each other.\n\nBut with expert contact tracing by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Singapore Police Force (SPF), coupled with a world\u2019s first laboratory test, the mystery link between Singapore\u2019s largest COVID-19 cluster and travellers from Wuhan \u2013 the epicentre of the virus \u2013 was finally found.\n\nCase 66 \u2013 the primary case at Grace Assembly of God\n\nIt all started with Case 66, a 28 year-old Singaporean male with no travel history to China. He works at the Grace Assembly of God as a church staff, and was the earliest reported case of this cluster.\n\nCase 66 had reported the onset of symptoms on 29 January, and had gone to work at the church in Tanglin while symptomatic.\n\nSixteen members and staff of the church were subsequently infected with the virus \u2013 initially through a staff meeting he attended, and subsequently through various church activities.\n\nThrough detailed epidemiological investigation and assistance from the SPF, MOH determined that Case 66 was the primary case of the cluster at Grace Assembly of God \u2013 the largest COVID-19 cluster here.\n\nBut how did Case 66 first contract the virus?\n\nCNY gathering at Mei Hwan Drive\n\nOn 12 February, Case 66 was referred to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection two days later.\n\nUpon further investigation, MOH found that he had attended a Chinese New Year (CNY) gathering at Mei Hwan Drive on the first day of CNY, 25 January.\n\nAmong the attendees were Cases 83 and 91, a married couple.\n\nWhen contacted by the contact tracing team, both Cases 83 and 91 were, however, not sick; they had no symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nCases 83 and 91 \u2013 the missing link\n\nChecking through their records, MOH found that Case 91 had actually gone to Sengkang General Hospital\u2019s emergency department on 26 January with COVID-19-like symptoms. Based on the case definitions at that time, she was not identified as a suspect case.\n\nHer husband, Case 83, had also been unwell in end-January, and had sought treatment several times at a general practitioner clinic.\n\nMOH\u2019s investigations had also earlier uncovered that both Cases 83 and 91 were at The Life Church and Missions Singapore on 19 January \u2013 the same day Cases 8 and 9, two Chinese nationals from Wuhan, had visited the church.\n\nMOH were now presented with a possible link between Wuhan (Cases 8 and 9), The Life Church and Missions Singapore cluster (through Cases 83 and 91), and the Grace Assembly of God cluster (through Case 66).\n\nCases 83 and 91 likely got infected from Cases 8 and 9, and had then passed the infection to Case 66 at the CNY gathering, who subsequently passed to his colleagues at Grace Assembly of God.\n\n\n\nEstablishing a positive link despite COVID-19 negative\n\nMOH arranged for Cases 83 and 91 to be tested at NCID. However, as both were already well, the current test to confirm COVID-19 infection would not work.\n\nThis is because the lab test, called Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), detects whether the presence of viral genetic material (COVID-19 in this case) is present in a patient\u2019s biological sample. When a patient has recovered and his immune system cleared of the virus, the test would return negative.\n\nHowever, knowing that the immune system produces antibodies in response to the infection \u2013 which can stay with the recovered patient for several years \u2013 MOH decided to test them with a new type of test, known as the serological test.\n\nSerological testing \u2013 a world\u2019s first\n\nIn came the research team at Duke-NUS Medical School, who had earlier successfully cultured the COVID-19 virus, shortly after Singapore confirmed its first case. The team had then rapidly developed several laboratory tests to detect the virus-specific antibodies for contact tracing, among other applications.\n\nUsing two different antibody testing platforms (virus neutralisation assay and ELISA assay), they were able to confirm that Cases 83 and 91 had high levels of antibodies that were specific to COVID-19.\n\nThis meant that both cases had indeed been infected with COVID-19 in late-January, even though they have since recovered.\n\nThis was a significant piece of evidence, as it definitively established the links between the two church clusters, the CNY family gathering, and the travellers from Wuhan.\n\nClose collaboration between agencies\n\nThis significant breakthrough was made possible through the close collaboration between MOH\u2019s contact tracing and epidemiological teams, SPF, as well as the researchers at Duke-NUS Medical School.\n\nMOH and SPF had extensively analysed the activity maps of the confirmed cases, interviewed them as well as their close contacts, in order to establish a detailed map of possible transmission across the different cases.\n\nDuke-NUS researchers\u2019 quick response then provided the confirmation needed to connect the clusters together.\n\nWith the discovery of the links between the two church clusters to the travellers from Wuhan, MOH has now determined the likely source of infection for a large majority of the locally-transmitted cases.",

Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2-14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  distribution; emerging infectious diseases; epidemiology; incubation period; virus\n\n PMID: \t32079150 \tDOI: \t10.3390/jcm9020538 \n  Free full text",

[Epub ahead of print]  Structure analysis of the receptor binding of 2019-nCoV.Chen Y1, Guo Y1, Pan Y2, Zhao ZJ3.\nAuthor informationAbstract   2019-nCoV is a newly identified coronavirus with high similarity to SARS-CoV. We performed a structural analysis of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein responsible for entry of coronaviruses into host cells. The RBDs from the two viruses share 72% identity in amino acid sequences, and molecular simulation reveals highly similar ternary structures. However, 2019-nCoV has a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in SARS-CoV. Molecular modeling revealed that 2019-nCoV RBD has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A unique phenylalanine F486 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, to mammals. Structural analysis suggests that ACE2 from these animals can potentially bind RBD of 2019-nCoV, making them all possible natural hosts for the virus. 2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. However, since ACE2 is predominantly expressed in intestines, testis, and kidney, fecal-oral and other routes of transmission are also possible. Finally, antibodies and small molecular inhibitors that can block the interaction of ACE2 with RBD should be developed to combat the virus.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

[Epub ahead of print]  COVID-2019: the role of the nsp2 and nsp3 in its pathogenesis.Angeletti S1, Benvenuto D2, Bianchi M3, Giovanetti M4, Pascarella S3, Ciccozzi M2.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Last December 2019, a new virus, named COVID-2019 causing many cases of severe pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China. The virus knowledge is limited and especially about COVID-2019 pathogenesis. The Open Reading Frame 1ab (ORF1ab) of COVID-2019 has been analyzed to evidence the presence of mutation caused by selective pressure on the virus. For selective pressure analysis fast-unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR) was used. Homology modelling has been performed by SwissModel and HHPred servers. The presence of transmembrane helical segments in Coronavirus ORF1ab nsp2 and nsp3, was tested by TMHMM, MEMSAT and MEMPACK tools. Three-dimensional structures have been analyzed and displayed using PyMOL. FUBAR analysis revealed the presence of potential sites under positive selective pressure (p-value < 0.05). Position 723 in the COVID-2019 has a serine instead a glycine residue, while at aminoacidic position 1010 a proline instead an isoleucine. Significant (p < 0.05) pervasive negative selection in 2416 sites (55%) was found. The positive selective pressure could account for some clinical features of this virus compared to SARS and Bat SARS-like CoV. The stabilizing mutation falling in the endosome-associated-protein-like domain of the nsp2 protein could account for COVID-2019 high ability of contagious, while the destabilizing mutation in nsp3 proteins could suggest a potential mechanism differentiating COVID-2019 from SARS. These data could be helpful for further investigation aimed to identify potential therapeutic targets or vaccine strategy, especially in the actual moment when the epidemic is ongoing and the scientific community is trying to enrich knowledge about this new viral pathogen.

Methods: Data of reported NCP cases and Baidu Migration Indexin all provinces of the country as of February 14, 2020 were collected. The correlation analysis between cumulative number of reported cases and the migration index from Hubei was performed, and the imported risks from Hubei to different provinces across China were further evaluated. Results: A total of 49 970 confirmed cases were reported nationwide, of which 37 884 were in Hubei Province. The average daily migration index from Hubei to other provinces was 312.09, Wuhan and other cities in Hubei were 117.95 and 194.16, respectively. The cumulative NCP cases of provinces was positively correlated with the migration index derived from Hubei province, also in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei, with correlation coefficients of 0.84, 0.84, and 0.81. In linear model, population migration from Hubei Province, Wuhan and other cities in Hubei account for 71.2%, 70.1%, and 66.3% of the variation, respectively. The period of high exported risk from Hubei occurred before January 27, of which the risks before January 23 mainly came from Wuhan, and then mainly from other cities in Hubei. Hunan Province, Henan Province and Guangdong Province ranked the top three in terms of cumulative imported risk (the cumulative risk indices were 58.61, 54.75 and 49.62 respectively). Conclusion: The epidemic in each province was mainly caused by the importation of Hubei Province. Taking measures such as restricting the migration of population in Hubei Province and strengthening quarantine measures for immigrants from Hubei Province may greatly reduce the risk of continued spread of the epidemic.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Novel coronavirus pneumonia; Population migration; Risk assessment\n\n PMID: \t32083409 \tDOI: \t10.3760/cma.j.cn112150-20200219-00142",

On February 12, 2020, WHO officially named the disease caused by the novel coronavirus as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since most COVID-19 infected patients were diagnosed with pneumonia and characteristic CT imaging patterns, radiological examinations have become vital in early diagnosis and assessment of disease course. To date, CT findings have been recommended as major evidence for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 in Hubei, China. This review focuses on the etiology, epidemiology, and clinical symptoms of COVID-19, while highlighting the role of chest CT in prevention and disease control.

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has affected the normal diagnosis and treatment services in oral medical institutions across the country. Delay of non-emergency dental service will have a potential impact on the experience, cognition, treatment and rehabilitation of patients with oral diseases. Through literature review, this paper reviewed the oral psychosomatic diseases closely related to patients' psychological state, such as oral mucosal disease, temporomandibular joint disease, bruxism, periodontal disease and so on. It was believed that these patients might be more susceptible to the impact of stress events, and dental specialists should pay more attention to them. At the same time, this paper analyzes the possible psychological stress symptoms of patients with different oral diseases, and puts forward suggestions for remote consultation and emergency treatment of dentists. From the perspective of social role, dentists not only played the role of expert in dental home professional guidance, but also played the role of psychological counseling for patients.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Crisis intervention; Novel coronavirus pneumonia; Oral psychosomatic disorder; Stress, psychological\n\n PMID: \t32086886 \tDOI: \t10.3760/cma.j.cn112144-20200213-00053",

Comparisons between the viruses were made.\nRESULTS:  Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic. Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport. The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally.\nCONCLUSIONS:  We conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed.

Some cases can develop into ARDS, or even death. We will share the treatment experience of severe NCP with the first-line treatment experience. The best respiratory support mode should be selected, but the timing of intubation and protection during intubation are two difficulties; patients with high level peep and poor effect in prone position can be given ECMO support. For NCP patients with mechanical ventilation, reasonable sedation and analgesia strategies should be formulated; delirium should not be ignored.

Methods: From January 2020 to February 2020, 54 patients who were newly diagnosed with NCP in Wuhan Fourth Hospital were included in this study. RT-PCR method was used to measure the level of 2019-nCov RNA in pharyngeal swab samples of these patients. The patients were divided into RNA positive and negative group, and the differences of clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics were compared. Results: There were 31 RNA of 2019-nCov positive cases, and 23 negative cases. Common clinical symptoms of two groups were fever (80.64% vs. 86.96%) , chills (61.29% vs.52.17%) , cough (80.64% vs.95.65%) , fatigue (61.30% vs.56.52%) , chest distress (77.42% vs.73.91%) . Some other symptoms were headache, myalgia, dyspnea, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. The laboratory and radiological characteristics of two groups mainly were lymphopenia, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased C-reactive protein, increased lactate dehydrogenase, decreased oxygenation index, normal white blood cell count and bilateral chest CT involvement. There was no statistically significant difference in other clinical characteristics except for dyspnea between two groups. Conclusions: RNA positive and negative NCP patients shared similar clinical symptoms, while RNA positive NCP patients tended to have dyspnea.

Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19.\nMETHODS:  We used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk.\nFINDINGS:  Countries with the highest importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. We identified three clusters of countries that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the city of Beijing, respectively.\nINTERPRETATION:  Many countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations. Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently prioritised in countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect imported cases and to limit onward transmission.\nFUNDING:  EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation Horizon 2020, Agence Nationale de la Recherche.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

It is not the precursor of SARS-CoV-2, but comparison of viral genome sequences provides further evidence that the virus currently infecting humans was not produced in a laboratory.\n  There are two important sequences in the viral spike glycoprotein (pictured) that are important for tracing the origin of SARS-CoV-2: a furin cleavage site (discussed last week) and the receptor binding domain (RBD).\n  The results of experiments in cells in culture have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binds the cell receptor ACE2. Six amino acids in the RBD are critical for binding to this receptor. Five of these six amino acids differ in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 compared with sequence from the bat virus RaTG13, the most closely related virus. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binds ACE2 with high affinity, an outcome not predicted by computational analysis of the RBD sequence. If someone were to engineer an RBD into a bat SARS-like CoV to allow efficient infection of human cells, they would not use the amino acid sequence in the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Rather the specific sequence was likely selected during replication in cells with human-like ACE2.\n  As discussed previously, the furin cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike is not present in the bat virus RaTG13. Its acquisition could allow enhanced infection of human cells. In addition to the furin cleavage site, an extra proline is also present, a change predicted to lead to the addition of O-linked glycans in the vicinity. If someone were to engineer the furin cleavage site into the spike, it is not likely that the extra proline would have been included. Furthermore, the addition of such glycans typically occurs under immune selection.\n  The genome sequences of CoVs recently isolated from pangolins are not close enough to SARS-CoV-2 to have been its immediate progenitor. However, the RBD of these pangolin CoVs are identical to that of SARS-CoV-2 at 6 of 6 of the key amino acids discussed above. This observation indicates that passage of CoV in a host with human-like ACE2 could select for a RBD with high-affinity binding. Such passage could also select for insertion of the furin cleavage site, which is not present in pangolin CoVs. Once a virus with the appropriate RBD and furin cleavage site arose in an animal \u2013 a bat or intermediate host \u2013 it would then replicate once introduced into humans.\n  Another possibility is that viruses with the correct RBD have been repeatedly jumping into humans, but efficient human to human transmission was not established until the acquisition of the furin cleavage site. Such is the scenario with MERS-CoV, which has jumped multiple times from camels to humans, but each chain of infection is short and soon ends. The virus has never become established in humans because the required mutations have not entered the viral genome. Serological surveys specific for SARS-CoV-2 might test this hypothesis for its emergence.\n  Could laboratory passage of a bat SARS-like virus lead to isolation and accidental emergence of SARS-CoV-2? This scenario would require starting with a virus that is very close to the current isolates. Passage in cell culture might have selected for the RBD amino acid changes to enable high affinity ACE2 binding. However this virus would have had to be very similar to SARS-CoV-2, and no such isolate is known to be present in any laboratory. Selection of viruses with a furin cleavage site would likely have taken extensive passaging in cells. Finally, it is unlikely that the O-linked glycan addition site would have emerged without immune pressure, which is absent in cell cultures.\n  Proving or disproving any of these hypotheses for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 might never be possible. Nevertheless, isolation of SARS-like viruses from a variety of animals might help to clarify the steps to emergence in humans. For MERS-CoV, a priority should be to prevent human infections, perhaps by immunizing camels, to avoid the emergence of another epidemic CoV with sustained transmission in humans.\n\nhttp://www.virology.ws/2020/02/20/pa...4slgskv4-VyWiw",

Since then, this highly contagious coronavirus has been spreading worldwide, with a rapid rise in the number of deaths. Novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP) is characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. A variety of chest imaging features have been reported, similar to those found in other types of coronavirus syndromes. The purpose of the present review is to briefly discuss the known epidemiology and the imaging findings of coronavirus syndromes, with a focus on the reported imaging findings of NCIP. Moreover, the authors review precautions and safety measures for radiology department personnel to manage patients with known or suspected NCIP. Implementation of a robust plan in the radiology department is required to prevent further transmission of the virus to patients and department staff members.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 American College of Radiology.

One possible answer is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses. ADE modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, one or all of which have been documented in severe cases and deaths. ADE also requires prior exposure to similar antigenic epitopes, presumably circulating in local viruses, making it a possible explanation for the observed geographic limitation of severe cases and deaths.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020.

Use of corticosteroids in influenza-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe pneumonia: a systemic review and meta-analysis.Zhou Y1, Fu X1, Liu X1, Huang C1, Tian G1,2, Ding C1, Wu J1, Lan L1, Yang S3.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Influenza-related severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are severe threats to human health. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of systematic corticosteroid therapy in patients with pneumonia or ARDS. The PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and SCOPUS databases were searched up to July, 2019. Nineteen studies including 6637 individuals were identified, and fifteen studies (6427 patients) were included in the meta-analysis of mortality. Eighteen were observational studies and one was a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The meta-analysis results showed that corticosteroid therapy was associated with significantly higher mortality (OR 1.53, 95% CI [1.16, 2.01]) and incidence of nosocomial infection (OR 3.15, 95% CI [1.54, 6.45]). Subgroup analysis showed that among patients with unadjusted estimates, the odds of mortality were higher in patients receiving corticosteroid treatment (OR 1.98, 95% CI [1.23, 3.17]), however, among patients with adjusted estimates, the result showed no statistically significant difference between corticosteroid group and control group (OR 1.31, 95% CI [0.95, 1.80]). Current data do not support the routine use of corticosteroids in patients with influenza severe pneumonia or ARDS. RCTs are needed to provide more robust evidence.\n\n\n PMID: \t32080223 \tDOI: \t10.1038/s41598-020-59732-7 \n  Free full text",

Assessment of adverse events related to anti-influenza neuraminidase inhibitors using the FDA adverse event reporting system and online patient reviews.Han N1, Oh JM2, Kim IW3.\nAuthor informationAbstract   The recommended antiviral drugs available for the treatment and prevention of influenza are neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs). The aim of this study was to evaluate age-related clinical manifestations of adverse events (AEs) related to NAIs. FAERS and WebMD data were downloaded. The available NAIs selected for the analysis were oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir. Disproportionality was analyzed using the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the reporting odds ratio (ROR), and the information component (IC) methods. In total, 16729 AEs from 4598 patients and 575 AEs from 440 patients in the FAERS and WebMD, respectively, were included in the analysis. In the FAERS, AEs were more common among those who were younger (<19 years) for zanamivir, while for those who were older (>65 years) for peramivir. A disproportionality analysis showed that signals for vomiting and hallucinations were detected in younger patients given oseltamivir, while an abnormal hepatic function, cardiac failure, shock, and cardio-respiratory arrest were detected in older patients given peramivir. Psychiatric disorders were most common in younger and older patients, while gastrointestinal disorders were most common in adult given oseltamivir in the WebMD. Adverse symptoms related to NAIs varied and depended on the drugs used and the age of the patient.\n\n\n PMID: \t32080337 \tDOI: \t10.1038/s41598-020-60068-5 \n  Free full text",

Specific memory B cell response in humans upon infection with highly pathogenic H7N7 avian influenza virus.Westerhuis B1,2, Ten Hulscher H1, Jacobi R1, van Beek J1, Koopmans M2, Rimmelzwaan G2,3, Meijer A1, Binnendijk RV4.\nAuthor informationAbstract   H7 avian influenza viruses represent a major public health concern, and worldwide outbreaks raise the risk of a potential pandemic. Understanding the memory B cell response to avian (H7) influenza virus infection in humans could provide insights in the potential key to human infection risks. We investigated an epizootic of the highly pathogenic A(H7N7) in the Netherlands, which in 2003 led to infection of 89 persons and one fatal case. Subtype-specificity of antibodies were determined for confirmed H7N7 infected individuals (cases) (n\u2009=\u200919), contacts of these cases (n\u2009=\u200921) and a comparison group controls (n\u2009=\u200916), by microarray, using recombinant hemagglutinin (HA)1 proteins. The frequency and specificity of memory B cells was determined by detecting subtype-specific antibodies in the culture supernatants from in vitro stimulated oligoclonal B cell cultures, from peripheral blood of cases and controls. All cases (100%) had high antibody titers specific for A(H7N7)2003 (GMT\u2009>\u2009100), whereas H7-HA1 antigen binding was detected in 29% of contacts and 31% of controls, suggesting that some of the H7 reactivity stems from cross reactive antibodies. To unravel homotypic and heterotypic responses, the frequency and specificity of memory B cells were determined in 2 cases. Ten of 123 HA1 reactive clones isolated from the cases bound to only H7- HA1, whereas 5 bound both H7 and other HA1 antigens. We recovered at least four different epitopal reactivities, though none of the H7 reactive antibodies were able to neutralize H7 infections in vitro. Our study serologically confirms the infection with H7 avian influenza viruses, and shows that H7 infection triggers a mixture of strain -specific and cross-reactive antibodies.\n\n\n PMID: \t32081953 \tDOI: \t10.1038/s41598-020-60048-9 \n  Free full text",

Outcome of Critically Ill Patients With Influenza Infection: A Retrospective Study.Abaziou T1, Delmas C2, Vardon Bounes F1, Bignon F3, Crognier L1, Seguin T1, Riu-Poulenc B1, Ruiz S1, Rouget A1, Cougot P1, Georges B1, Conil JM1, Minville V1.\nAuthor informationAbstract Background:  Influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality in adults, and numerous patients require intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is clearly described in this context, but other clinical presentations exist that need to be assessed for incidence and outcome. The primary goal of this study was to describe the characteristics of patients admitted in ICU for influenza, their clinical presentation, and the 3-month mortality rate. The second objective was to search for 3-month mortality risk factors.\nMethods:  This is a retrospective study including all patients admitted to 3 ICUs due to influenza-related disease between October 2013 and June 2016, which assesses the 3-month mortality rate. We compared clinical presentation, biological data, and outcome at 3\u2009months between survivors and non-survivors. We created a predicting 3-month mortality model with Classification and Regression Tree analysis.\nResults:  Sixty-nine patients were included, 50 patients (72.5%) for ARDS, 5 (7.2%) for myocarditis, and 14 (20.3%) for acute respiratory failure without ARDS criteria. Non-typed influenza A was found in 30 cases (43.5%), influenza A H1N1 in 18 (26.1%), H3N2 in 3 (4.3%), and influenza B in 18 cases (27.5%). The 3-month mortality rate was 29% (n\u2009=\u200920). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was implanted in 23 patients, without any significant increase in mortality (39% vs 24% without ECMO, P\u2009=\u2009.19). A creatinine serum superior to 96\u2009\u03bcmol/L, an aspartate aminotransferase level superior to 68\u2009UI/L, and a Pao2/Fio2 ration below 110 were associated with 3-month mortality in our predictive mortality model.\nConclusion:  Influenza in ICUs may have several clinical presentations. The mortality rate is high, but ECMO may be an effective rescue therapy.\n  \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  ARDS; ECMO; ICU; Influenza; acute respiratory failure; myocarditis\n\n PMID: \t32082048 \tPMCID: \tPMC7005979 \tDOI: \t10.1177/1178633720904081 \nFree PMC Article",

Linking influenza virus evolution within and between human hosts.Xue KS1,2,3, Bloom JD1,2,4.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Influenza viruses rapidly diversify within individual human infections. Several recent studies have deep-sequenced clinical influenza infections to identify viral variation within hosts, but it remains unclear how within-host mutations fare at the between-host scale. Here, we compare the genetic variation of H3N2 influenza within and between hosts to link viral evolutionary dynamics across scales. Synonymous sites evolve at similar rates at both scales, indicating that global evolution at these putatively neutral sites results from the accumulation of within-host variation. However, nonsynonymous mutations are depleted between hosts compared to within hosts, suggesting that selection purges many of the protein-altering changes that arise within hosts. The exception is at antigenic sites, where selection detectably favors nonsynonymous mutations at the global scale, but not within hosts. These results suggest that selection against deleterious mutations and selection for antigenic change are the main forces that act on within-host variants of influenza virus as they transmit and circulate between hosts.\n  \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

[Epub ahead of print]  A unique feature of swine ANP32A provides susceptibility to avian influenza virus infection in pigs.Zhang H1, Li H1, Wang W2, Wang Y1, Han GZ2, Chen H1, Wang X1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Both the replication and transcription of the influenza virus are catalyzed by the viral polymerase complex. The polymerases of most avian influenza A viruses have poor performance in mammalian cells, which is considered to be one of the important species barriers. Pigs have been long considered as important intermediate hosts for interspecies transmission of the avian influenza virus, because of their susceptibility to infection with both avian and mammalian influenza viruses. However, the molecular basis of influenza polymerase adaptation in pigs remains largely unknown. ANP32A and ANP32B proteins have been identified as playing fundamental roles in influenza virus replication and host range determination. In this study, we found that swine ANP32A (swANP32A), unlike swine ANP32B or other mammalian ANP32A or B, shows stronger supporting activity to avian viral polymerase. Knockout of ANP32A in pig cells PK15 dramatically reduced avian influenza polymerase activity and viral infectivity, suggesting a unique feature of swANP32A in supporting avian influenza viral polymerase. This species-specific activity is mapped to two key sites, 106V and 156S, in swANP32A. Interestingly, the amino acid 106V is unique to pigs among all the vertebrate species studied, and when combined with 156S, exhibits positive epistasis in pigs. Mutation of 106V and 156S to the signature found in ANP32As from other mammalian species weakened the interaction between swANP32A and chicken viral polymerase, and reduced polymerase activity. Understanding the molecular basis of ANP32 proteins may help to discover new antiviral targets and design avian influenza resistant genome edited pigs.\n\n\n PMID: \t32084248 \tDOI: \t10.1371/journal.ppat.1008330 \n  Free full text",

An Oleanolic Acid Derivative Inhibits Hemagglutinin-Mediated Entry of Influenza A Virus.Ye M1,2, Liao Y3, Wu L2, Qi W2, Choudhry N1,2, Liu Y1,2, Chen W4, Song G3, Chen J1,2.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Influenza A viruses (IAV) have been a major public health threat worldwide, and options for antiviral therapy become increasingly limited with the emergence of drug-resisting virus strains. New and effective anti-IAV drugs, especially for highly pathogenic influenza, with different modes of action, are urgently needed. The influenza virus glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) plays critical roles in the early stage of virus infection, including receptor binding and membrane fusion, making it a potential target for the development of anti-influenza drugs. In this study, we show that OA-10, a newly synthesized triterpene out of 11 oleanane-type derivatives, exhibited significant antiviral activity against four different subtypes of IAV (H1N1, H5N1, H9N2 and H3N2) replications in A549 cell cultures with EC50 ranging from 6.7 to 19.6 \u03bcM and a negligible cytotoxicity (CC50 > 640 \u03bcM). It inhibited acid-induced hemolysis in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 26 \u00b5M, and had a weak inhibition on the adsorption of H5 HA to chicken erythrocytes at higher concentrations (\u226540 \u00b5M). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis showed that OA-10 interacted with HA in a dose-dependent manner with the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of the interaction of 2.98 \u00d7 10-12 M. Computer-aided molecular docking analysis suggested that OA-10 might bind to the cavity in HA stem region which is known to undergo significant rearrangement during membrane fusion. Our results demonstrate that OA-10 inhibits H5N1 IAV replication mainly by blocking the conformational changes of HA2 subunit required for virus fusion with endosomal membrane. These findings suggest that OA-10 could serve as a lead for further development of novel virus entry inhibitors to prevent and treat IAV infections.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  hemagglutinin (HA); influenza A virus (IAV); oleanane-type derivatives; virus entry inhibitors\n\n PMID: \t32085430 \tDOI: \t10.3390/v12020225",

Investigation of influenza and respiratory viruses in hospitalised patients with influenza-like illness in an emergency room.Aysert-Yildiz P1, Aktas F2.\nAuthor informationAbstract INTRODUCTION:  Influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance is usually performed using outpatient data, and information on the surveillance of patients hospitalised for ILI, which is critical for the complete assessment of the influenza burden, is lacking.\nMETHODOLOGY:  In this prospective active surveillance study, patients with community-acquired ILI hospitalised for at least 24 hours in the Emergency Room (ER) of Gazi University Hospital were identified according to the ICD-10 codes at hospital admission through active surveillance of the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 influenza seasons. The presence of influenza and other respiratory viruses was analysed in the nasopharyngeal or pharyngeal specimens by real-time polymerase chain reaction.\nRESULTS:  351 patients admitted to emergency room with certain ICD-10 codes were assessed, and 111 patients with ILI were included in the study. We detected 15 influenza and 23 other respiratory viruses in 33 of the 111 patients. More than one virus was detected in 5 patients. No virus was detected in a majority of the patients with ILI. The sensitivity of hospital admission/discharge ICD-10 codes used in the study to detect real influenza cases was low. Patients with influenza were admitted to the hospital more frequently with high fever symptoms compared with patients with influenza virus-negative and other respiratory virus-positive (p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS:  This study revealed that non-influenza respiratory viruses were a major contributor to ILI. Patients admitted with fever during the influenza seasons should be evaluated for influenza virus infection, and the use of diagnostic codes in surveillance studies can lead to incorrect results.\n  Copyright (c) 2019 Pinar Aysert-Yildiz, Firdevs Aktas.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  emergency room; influenza; influenza-like illness\n\n PMID: \t32087074 \tDOI: \t10.3855/jidc.10893 \n  Free full text",

In 2008, we estimated that 20 million influenza-virus-associated ALRI and 1 million influenza-virus-associated severe ALRI occurred in children under 5 years globally. Despite this substantial burden, only a few low-income and middle-income countries have adopted routine influenza vaccination policies for children and, where present, these have achieved only low or unknown levels of vaccine uptake. Moreover, the influenza burden might have changed due to the emergence and circulation of influenza A/H1N1pdm09. We aimed to incorporate new data to update estimates of the global number of cases, hospital admissions, and mortality from influenza-virus-associated respiratory infections in children under 5 years in 2018.\nMETHODS:  We estimated the regional and global burden of influenza-associated respiratory infections in children under 5 years from a systematic review of 100 studies published between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2018, and a further 57 high-quality unpublished studies. We adapted the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess the risk of bias. We estimated incidence and hospitalisation rates of influenza-virus-associated respiratory infections by severity, case ascertainment, region, and age. We estimated in-hospital deaths from influenza virus ALRI by combining hospital admissions and in-hospital case-fatality ratios of influenza virus ALRI. We estimated the upper bound of influenza virus-associated ALRI deaths based on the number of in-hospital deaths, US paediatric influenza-associated death data, and population-based childhood all-cause pneumonia mortality data in six sites in low-income and lower-middle-income countries.\nFINDINGS:  In 2018, among children under 5 years globally, there were an estimated 109\u00b75 million influenza virus episodes (uncertainty range [UR] 63\u00b71-190\u00b76), 10\u00b71 million influenza-virus-associated ALRI cases (6\u00b78-15\u00b71); 870\u2008000 influenza-virus-associated ALRI hospital admissions (543\u2008000-1\u2008415\u2008000), 15\u2008300 in-hospital deaths (5800-43\u2008800), and up to 34\u2008800 (13\u2008200-97\u2008200) overall influenza-virus-associated ALRI deaths. Influenza virus accounted for 7% of ALRI cases, 5% of ALRI hospital admissions, and 4% of ALRI deaths in children under 5 years. About 23% of the hospital admissions and 36% of the in-hospital deaths were in infants under 6 months. About 82% of the in-hospital deaths occurred in low-income and lower-middle-income countries.\nINTERPRETATION:  A large proportion of the influenza-associated burden occurs among young infants and in low-income and lower middle-income countries. Our findings provide new and important evidence for maternal and paediatric influenza immunisation, and should inform future immunisation policy particularly in low-income and middle-income countries.\nFUNDING:  WHO; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

Overall survival (OS) was immature at the initial report. Methods: We reported the final OS analysis from the original study population and within subgroups. Results: Both at the univariate and multivariate analysis, the occurrence of influenza syndrome (IS) was significantly related to better OS in the overall population (OR: 0.53 [95% CI: 0.32-0.88]; p = 0.01). In the lung cancer subgroup, receiving flu vaccine and/or developing IS was related to better OS (p = 0.04). Within elderly patients, the flu vaccine was the main variable for the relative OS advantage (p = 0.05). Conclusion: Receiving the flu vaccine and/or developing IS was related to better OS within the INVIDIa population.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  flu vaccine; immune checkpoint inhibitors; immunotherapy; influenza syndrome; influenza vaccination; overall survival\n\n PMID: \t32089035 \tDOI: \t10.2217/imt-2019-0180",

Effects of influenza vaccination on seasonal influenza symptoms: A prospective observational study in elementary schoolchildren in Japan.Uchida M1, Takeuchi S2, Saito MM3, Koyama H1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Although influenza vaccine has been shown to prevent influenza symptom onset, its further beneficial effects after vaccinated individuals become symptomatic remain undetermined. This epidemiological survey compared influenza symptoms in subjects diagnosed with influenza who were and were not vaccinated. A prospective survey was performed among the 13,217 schoolchildren who attended all 29 public elementary schools in Matsumoto City, Nagano Prefecture, Japan, during the 2014/2015 influenza season. Information about symptoms and background demographic and clinical factors were obtained from a questionnaire. Of these schoolchildren, 2,548 were diagnosed with influenza and 1,122 were previously vaccinated and 1,426 were unvaccinated. Fever duration and frequency of symptoms and hospitalization were compared in vaccinated and unvaccinated children. The hospitalization rate was lower in vaccinated children, whereas symptom frequency and fever duration were similar in the two groups. This study showed that hospitalization was less in vaccinated children. Vaccination may attenuate symptom intensity after symptom onset.\n  \u00a9 2020 The Authors.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Bayesian statistics; Elementary schoolchildren; Epidemiology; Infectious disease; Influenza; Public health; Vaccination; Vaccines\n\n PMID: \t32090182 \tPMCID: \tPMC7026291 \tDOI: \t10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03385 \n  Free full text",

We used network analysis to explore the devastating epidemic of HPAI A(H5N8) among poultry, in particular ducks, in France during 2016-2017 and to estimate the likely contribution of live-duck movements. Approximately 0.2% of live-duck movements could have been responsible for between-farm transmission events, mostly early during the epidemic. Results also suggest a transmission risk of 35.5% when an infected holding moves flocks to another holding within 14 days before detection. Finally, we found that densely connected groups of holdings with sparse connections between groups overlapped farmer organizations, which represents important knowledge for surveillance design. This study highlights the importance of movement bans in zones affected by HPAI and of understanding transmission routes to develop appropriate HPAI control strategies.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  France; animal and public health; avian influenza; highly pathogenic avian influenza; influenza; live-duck movements; social network analysis; transmission pathways; viruses; zoonoses\n\n PMID: \t32091357 \tDOI: \t10.3201/eid2603.190412",

[Epub ahead of print]  Comparative Severity of Influenza A and B Infections in Hospitalized Children.Mattila JM1, Vuorinen T2,3, Heikkinen T1.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  Influenza A viruses are conventionally thought to cause more severe illnesses than B viruses, but few studies with long observation periods have compared the clinical severity of A and B infections in hospitalized children.\nMETHODS:  We analyzed the clinical presentation, outcomes and management of all children <16 years old admitted to Turku University Hospital, Finland, with virologically confirmed influenza A or B infection during the 14-year period of 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2018. All comparisons between influenza A and B were performed both within predefined age groups (0-2, 3-9 and 10-15 years) and in all age groups combined.\nRESULTS:  Among 391 children hospitalized with influenza A or B infection, influenza A was diagnosed in 279 (71.4%) and influenza B in 112 (28.6%) children. Overall, there were no significant differences in any clinical features or outcomes, management, treatment at intensive care unit or length of stay between children with influenza A and B, whether analyzed by age group or among all children. As indicators of the most severe clinical presentations, blood cultures were obtained from 101 (36.2%) children with influenza A and 39 (34.8%) with influenza B (P = 0.80), and lumbar puncture was performed to 16 (5.7%) children with influenza A and 11 (9.8%) children with influenza B (P = 0.15).\nCONCLUSIONS:  The clinical severity of influenza A and B infections is similar in children. For optimal protection against severe influenza illnesses, the use of quadrivalent vaccines containing both lineages of B viruses seems warranted in children.\n\n\n PMID: \t32091502 \tDOI: \t10.1097/INF.0000000000002610",

Thus, we further enriched the C5-NH2 position of oseltamivir structure to obtain more potent oseltamivir derivatives. In this article a series of oseltamivir derivatives were synthesized by modifying C5-NH2 position of oseltamivir. All the compounds were evaluated for in vitro antiviral activity against H5N1 and H5N8. Encouragingly, compounds 9a and 11e were exhibited prominent activity, which is similar to oseltamivir carboxylate (OSC) and in NAs inhibitory assay, 11e showed remarkable potency against N1 (H5N1), N2 (H5N2), N6 (H5N6) and N8 (H5N8). In addition, 11e demonstrated low cytotoxicity and no obvious toxicity at the dose of 1500 mg/kg in mice. Molecular docking studies of 9a and 11e provided a plausible rationale for the high potency against group-1 NAs. This work provided new insights to design further neuraminidase inhibitors, which can help to investigate new potent inhibitors for group-1 and group-2 shortly.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Bruce Aylward, who led an international mission to China to learn about the virus and China\u2019s response, said the specialists did not see evidence that a large number of mild cases of the novel disease called Covid-19 are evading detection.\n\n\u201cSo I know everybody\u2019s been out there saying, \u2018Whoa, this thing is spreading everywhere and we just can\u2019t see it, tip of the iceberg.\u2019 But the data that we do have don\u2019t support that,\u201d Aylward said during a briefing for journalists at WHO\u2019s Geneva headquarters.\n\nGetting a handle on how many people have actually been infected is crucial to assessing how dangerous this virus is. During the early days of an explosive outbreak with a new pathogen, it is hugely challenging to look beyond the people streaming into hospitals for care to see whether there are many more at home with a mild cold or manageable flu-like illness.\n\nIf large numbers of mild or virtually symptom-free cases are evading detection, that would suggest that estimates of the proportion of people who might end up in ICUs or might die during a Covid-19 epidemic would be lower than what has been seen to date in China...\n\nRead more: https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/25/...o-expert-says/",

He said that, without a drug or vaccine available to battle the new virus, the country used standard public health tools such as case finding and contact tracing with rigor and innovation \"on a scale that we have never seen in history.\"\n  Though Wuhan and Hubei province are the epicenter, the outbreak evolved differently as the virus spread to other provinces, and though the central government enforced rules, provincial health officials had the flexibility they needed to tailor the response to their situations.\n  The team also observed how China \"repurposed the machinery of government\" to battle the outbreak and used big data tools, including artificial intelligence, to manage a massive amount of information, such as contact tracing.\n  Aylward also said the team observed an agile, science-driven response, during which the government updated its clinical guidance six times as it learned more about the virus and illness.\n  China's stringent measures, such as sealing off towns and ordering people to stay in their homes, changed the course of the outbreak, with a decline that is now occurring sooner than expected, Aylward said. Team members had multiple ways of getting a sense of the decline, such as talking to doctors in Wuhan who spoke of open hospital beds and no more waiting lines for testing at fever clinics.\n  Because of the decline in cases, Chinese researchers report slower-than-expected enrollment of patients in drug treatment trials. China today reported 508 new cases, up from 409 reported yesterday, for a total of 77,658. The death toll is at 2,663, and there are 9,126 serious cases, according the National Health Commission.\n  Aylward urged countries that are bracing for outbreaks to shift their mindset. \"The world is not ready, but can get ready fast,\" he said, emphasizing that countries can indeed affect the course of the disease with aggressive and tough programs, noting that key steps should include planning for a heavy demand on hospitals and respiratory support, such as ventilators, staffing for contact tracing, and getting the public on board.\n  A big question that still remains unanswered is how many mild cases go undetected, a metric that is key for getting a better handle on the disease's severity and fatality rate. Aylward said the group saw bits of information, such as testing of samples from China's flu surveillance system and testing of convenience samples, that hint the number of milder cases may not be great. However, he said that over the last few days China approved two serology tests, which will help answer the question.\n  He said though asymptomatic transmission might play some role, household exposure seems to be the main driver of the outbreak. And he noted that many health workers who got sick were exposed in the community.\n  Regarding the clinical spectrum, Aylward said about 88% of patients remember having a fever and 68% had a dry cough. Only about 12% had a runny nose, hinting that COVID-19 might not have much upper respiratory involvement. Some patients reported a prodrome that consisted of fatigue, muscle pain, and a vague feeling of being unwell.\n  In those who have symptoms, 80% have mild disease, 13% have severe illness, and 6% are critically ill, the group found.\n  When pressed on whether countries outside China\u2014especially those without strong central governments\u2014could replicate China's experience, Aylward said countries can be masters of their own fate. \"Can that be replicated? Why not?\"\nItaly's total tops 300 as 3 new countries affected  Since yesterday, Italy's health ministry reported 93 more cases and 4 more deaths, raising the case total to 322, including 10 deaths. Though the outbreak is centered in northern Italy near Lombardy, the country today reported the first cases in more regions, including Tuscany, Sicily, Liguria, Bolzano province.\n  Also, Italy's health ministry said officials from the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control will meet with Italian health officials in Rome to discuss the next steps for managing Italy's outbreak.\n  In other European developments, three countries\u2014Austria, Croatia, and Switzerland\u2014reported their first COVID-19 cases.Austria's health ministry reported two confirmed cases. According to a media report, the patients are isolated in a hospital in Innsbruck, and one is from Lombardy, the epicenter of Italy's outbreak.\nCroatia today reported the country's first case, which involves a man who had recently traveled from Italy, Agence France-Presse reported, citing a health ministry official who said the man has mild symptoms and had visited Milan.\nSwitzerland today reported its first case, which was detected in Ticino canton near the border with Italy, according to a Swiss media report that cited the country's public health office. The patient is a man in his 70s who had visited the Milan region.\nMeanwhile, France and Spain\u2014two earlier affected countries\u2014reported more infections today. France reported two new cases, one involving a Chinese woman who recently returned from China and one involving a man who had recently traveled to Lombardy region in Italy, France24 reported today, citing French health officials. France now has 14 cases.\n  Spain today reported as many as three new patients. Two are a male traveler from Italy and his companion who were staying on the Canary Islands' resort island of Tenerife, where the hotel they are staying is on lockdown, CNN reported. The other is an Italian woman living in Barcelona who had recently visited northern Italy, including Bergamo and Milan, according to in Italian media report that cited Catalonia regional health officials.\nIran total nears 100; four regional countries reports more cases  Iran's health ministry today reported 34 more cases and 3 more deaths today, raising its case total to 95, which includes 15 deaths. In another development, the country's deputy health minister, who appeared to be suffering from symptoms while addressing reporters, and a member of parliament are among the confirmed cases, the BBC reported today.\n  Meanwhile, four countries in the Middle East that reported their first cases yesterday (Iraq, Bahrain, Oman, and Kuwait)\u2014all linked to Iran travel\u2014reported, more today.Iraq's health ministry reported 4 more cases, bringing its total to 5, Reuters reported today. The patients are members of an Iraqi family who had traveled to Iran.\nBahrain since yesterday has reported 22 more cases, raising its total to 23, the health ministry announced today. It said the 6 more recent patients had traveled from Iran.\nOman's health ministry today reported 2 more cases, lifting its total to 4. Both involved Iran travelers.\nKuwait's health ministry reported 1 more case, involving a woman who was in quarantine with a group of Iran travelers, putting its total at 9 so far, Kuwait News Agency\nKorea's cases approach 1,000  South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention today in three updates reported (60, 130, and 84 ) 274 new cases, down from 438 yesterday, raising its total to 977. It also reported 2 more deaths, lifting the fatality count to 10.\n  Daegu and Gyeongbuk are still the main hot spots, and the Shincheonji Church of Jesus cluster and a large hospital cluster make up 68.8% of cases.\n  In a related development yesterday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention raised it travel advisory for South Korea to his highest warning level, urging people to avoid nonessential travel due to widespread community transmission.\n  In Japan, the health ministry today reported 8 more cases, plus 1 more asymptomatic carrier, raising its total to 147, though it notes 164 overall cases that include 17 asymptomatic carriers.\n  The latest cases are from Nagano prefecture, Kumamoto, Sapporo, Ishikawa prefecture, Nagoya, and Tokushima prefecture.\n  Also, Japan reported another death in a passenger from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, a man in his 80s from Tokyo.\n  Elsewhere in Asia, Thailand reported two new cases, one a woman who had traveled to China and the other a driver who had served Chinese tourists, the Bangkok Post reported today. The country's case total is now at 37. And Singapore reported one more case, linked to an earlier patient, raising its total to 91.",

All patients (mean age, 49.5 years) had a wide range of abnormal lung changes that spread rapidly from focused areas of excess fluid in one lung to diffuse buildup in both lungs.\n  Patients were grouped based on the length of time between the emergence of symptoms and first CT scan: group 1 (asymptomatic patients); group 2 (scans within seven days of symptom onset); group 3 (scans 8 days to 2 weeks after symptom onset); and group 4 (scans 15 days to 3 weeks after symptom onset).\n  Radiologists at the two hospitals, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital and Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, recorded and compared the patients' clinical and laboratory findings and co-existing diseases at initial and follow-up CT scans.\nWide range of lung abnormality patterns  Different radiolographic patterns emerged at different points of the disease. The mean number of affected lung segments was 10.5: 2.8 in group 1, 11.1 in group 2, 13.0 in group 3, and 12.1 in group 4. The right lower lobe of the lung had a slight tendency toward involvement.\n  In asymptomatic patients, 60% had abnormalities confined to one lung, while 90% of group 2 patients had abnormalities in both lungs. Those in groups 3 and 4 showed more mixed patterns and areas where fluid had replaced the air in the lung, leading to swelling and hardening of tissues.\n  This study helped further characterize CT findings in the lungs of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. With development of acute respiratory distress syndrome as few as 9 days after symptom onset, the researchers say that prompt diagnosis and treatment are paramount. \"Combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia,\" they wrote.\nA diagnostic dilemma  In a commentary in the same journal, three radiologists from the University of Hong Kong said the varied presentations pose challenges when diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia.\n  \"This small number of individuals with COVID-19 pneumonia poses a diagnostic dilemma given the varied manifestations, the experts wrote.\n  \"There is more to be learnt about this novel contagious viral pneumonia; more research is needed into the correlation of CT findings with clinical severity and progression, the predictive value of baseline CT or temporal changes for disease outcome, and the sequelae of acute lung injury induced by COVID-19,\" they added.\nCharacterizing viral load  In a letter published in the same issue, researchers from the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control describe patterns of viral load in clinical samples collected from 82 patients hospitalized with COVID-19.\n  The researchers collected serial throat swabs, sputum, urine, and stool samples from two hospitalized patients in Beijing and examined them using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Viral loads in the throat swabs and sputum peaked about 5 or 6 days after symptom onset, with sputum showing higher loads than throat samples. No viral RNA was identified in the urine or stool samples.\n  They also analyzed nasal, throat, and sputum samples from 80 patients in different stages of infection. In general, the viral load soon after onset was high. Two patients under surveillance due to their exposure to patients with COVID-19 tested positive a day before symptom onset, suggesting that people with the virus can be infectious before they have symptoms.\n  Nine stool samples from 17 patients with confirmed COVID-19 tested positive using qRT-PCR zero to 11 days after symptom onset. \"Although the viral loads were less than those of respiratory samples\u2026precautionary measures should be considered when handling [fecal] samples,\" the authors wrote.",

These include individual, community, and environmental measures that range from closing schools to self-quarantine to cancelling mass gatherings in public spaces, she said.\n  \"Many of these are the preventative actions we recommend all the time,\" Messonnier said. \"Stay home from work or school if you're sick, wash hands, cover your cough.\"\nTest kits available 'soon,' but labs frustrated  Messonnier also addressed the stall in getting testing kits to state and local health departments.\n  \"I am frustrated that we have had issues with our test. I want to assure you we are hoping to modify the kits and hope to send them soon,\" Messonnier said.\n  She also pointed out that the CDC was testing as many as 400 samples at a time and providing overnight results. \"There is no current backlog or delay,\" she said.\n  On Feb 12, the CDC announced that several test kits sent to public health labs had an issue with a test reagent, which caused the negative control to generate a test response where there should have been none.\n  When pressed on when specifically the kits will be made available, Messonnier did not provide a date.\n  Currently, only 12 labs outside of the CDC\u2014located in California, Illinois, Nebraska, Nevada, and Tennessee\u2014have the capability to test for the virus. Peter Kyriacopoulos, the chief policy officer for APHL, told CIDRAP News the testing process could be dramatically shortened and expanded if 100 APHL-member labs receive authorization to do their own tests.\n  He said yesterday that the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) addressed a letter to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asking for permission for member laboratories to use lab-developed tests between now and when the improved CDC kit is re-sent. Permission has to be granted because the FDA already issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) authority for the CDC's test.\n  \"We know because of the prevalence of this issue in the media, many of our labs may be called to do testing, and they will want to be responsive,\" said Kyriacopoulos. He explained that the labs could do manual extraction of the virus RNA, but testing would be more streamlined if they were allowed to use automated RNA extraction platforms. He said the automatic extraction devices would cost each lab about $200,000.\n  Joanne Barkus, PhD, the director of the Public Health Laboratory at the Minnesota Department of Health, said she is frustrated by the delay.\n  \"We are trying to prepare for what I feel will be inevitable\u2014a case in Minnesota\u2014and we will want to expand testing,\" she told CIDRAP News. Right now, Barkus said the CDC was keeping up with test demands. But that could easily be changed if multiple community detections occur across the country and state epidemiologists begin testing case contacts en masse.\nWhite House requests emergency funds  Michael T. Osterholm, MPH, PhD, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, which published CIDRAP News, said he has received several calls from the media questioning if the delay in test kits is actually a plot devised by President Donald Trump to hide US case numbers.\n  \"I do not believe that,\" Osterholm said. \"It's an unfortunate situation and is something the CDC has stumbled on.\"\n  Yesterday Trump asked Congress for $1.25 billion in new emergency funds for the COVID-19 response, the Washington Post reported. The White House also asked Congress to access to $535 million that had been set aside to fight Ebola.\n  Today, in an address to the Senate, Director of Health and Human Services Alex Azar warned lawmakers the country was not sealed off from the virus. The New York Times said federal and local health departments will need as many as 300 million masks for healthcare workers and additional ventilators for hospitals.\n  \"Personal protective equipment is one of our needs,\" Messonnier said.\n  Yesterday in a New York Times op-ed piece, Osterholm and Mark Olshaker wrote, \"In a world ill-prepared for a potentially life-threatening, easily transmitted disease like COVID-19, the most effective way to mitigate the pandemic's impact is to focus on supporting health care systems that already are overburdened.\"\n  \"The United States and other countries in the Northern Hemisphere already are in the throes of a moderately serious flu season. Their inventories of protective equipment used by doctors, nurses and emergency medical workers \u2014 N-95 respirator masks, gloves, eye protection, disposable suits \u2014 are running low.\"",

This raises the number of MERS cases recorded this month to 11.\n  The case involves a 74-year-old man from Hafar Al Batin whose exposure to MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) is listed as primary, meaning it is unlikely he contracted the virus from another person. The MOH said the man had camel contact, a known risk factor for MERS.\n  Yesterday the World Health Organization (WHO) published a report on MERS cases recorded in December and January in Saudi Arabia. In total there were 19 cases and 8 deaths. Of note was a six-person hospital cluster in Aseer that included 3 healthcare workers, 2 patients, and 1 visitor. One infected person in this cluster died on Feb 4.\n  The WHO said that, since 2012, it has received reports of 2,519 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases, with 866 associated deaths. The vast majority of these cases have been in Saudi Arabia.\nFeb 25 Saudi MOH report \nFeb 24 WHO report \n\nFDA approves first adjuvanted 4-strain seasonal flu vaccine for seniors  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first adjuvanted quadrivalent (four-strain) seasonal influenza vaccine for people 65 years and older, Fluad Quadrivalent, according to manufacturer Seqirus, Inc.\n  The vaccine includes Seqirus's MF59 adjuvant, which is an immune-boosting additive, according to a news release yesterday from Seqirus, based in Summit, New Jersey. \"Adults 65 years and older are at high risk for influenza-related complications each season and it is important to have influenza vaccines to help protect this vulnerable population,\" said Anjana Narain, Seqirus executive vice president and general manager.\n  Unpublished data presented by Seqirus in December showed that Fluad Quadrivalent is more effective in reducing flu-related hospitalizations than a trivalent (three-strain) influenza vaccine (TIV) in adults 65 and older living in nursing facilities in 2016-17. In the study, 823 nursing facilities were randomly assigned to offer Fluad (21,278 residents) or a TIV (21,269 residents), and Fluad was 20% more effective than TIV in reducing influenza- and pneumonia-related hospitalizations.\n  Older adults are at elevated risk for complications from influenza. During the 2017-18 influenza season, 70% of influenza-related hospitalizations and 90% of related deaths occurred in this age range, Seqirus said. The vaccine also tends to be less effective in seniors because of their reduced immune response.\nFeb 24 Seqirus news release\nDec 10, 2019, CIDRAP Flu Scan on earlier data\n\nStudy: No need for adult tetanus, diphtheria booster if vaccinated as kids  Adults fully vaccinated as children can safely forego tetanus and diphtheria booster shots, according to a study published February 25 in Clinical Infectious Diseases.\n  After comparing data from millions of people in 31 North American and European countries from 2001 and 2016, researchers at the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) identified no statistically significant difference in disease rates in countries that require boosters for adults and those that don't. The investigators compared adults in countries that vaccinate adults against the two diseases every 5 to 20 years with those that don't.\n  The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls for boosters every 10 years, but the World Health Organization recently recommended boosters only for adults who didn't receive a full series as children.\n  \"To be clear, this study is pro-vaccine,\" says the study's lead author, Mark Slifka, PhD, a professor of microbiology and immunology at OHSU, in a school news relese. \"Everyone should get their series of tetanus and diphtheria shots when they're children. But once they have done that, our data indicates they should be protected for life.\"\n  The study follows one that Slifka and colleagues published in 2016 involving 546 adults, which demonstrated that the vaccine produces at least 30 years of protective immunity.\n  The United States could save roughly $1 billion each year in medical costs if it required fewer vaccinations in adults, the researchers said in the news release. It could also allow improved allocation of healthcare resources in countries with low vaccination rates.\n  Tetanus affects about 30 people in the United States each year, with 1 or 2 out of 10 cases leading to death. Diphtheria has been reported in only five people in the United States over the past decade, and about 1 in 10 cases is fatal.\nFeb 25 Clin Infect Dis abstract\nFeb 25 OHSU news release\nMar 21, 2016, previous study\n\nHigh-path avian flu kills poultry in Vietnam, Poland, and Bulgaria  Vietnam, Poland, and Bulgaria all reported multiple outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian flu, according to the latest reports from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).\n  Animal health officials in Vietnam confirmed 13 H5N6 outbreaks in village flocks ranging from 37 to 4,075 poultry, all in the north. Six outbreaks are in Thanh Hoa province, 2 in Ha Noi, and 1 each in Bac Ninh, Ninh Binh, Thai Binh, Nghe An, and Hai Pong provinces. The outbreaks began Feb 15 to Feb 21. All told, the virus sickened 6,680 birds and killed 4,274 among 25,375 susceptible poultry.\n  Poland, meanwhile, confirmed seven H5N8 outbreaks in the country's midsection affecting more than 170,000 birds. The seven affected farms are in five provinces (voivodeships), with the outbreaks beginning on Feb 7 through Feb 22. The virus struck 47,254 poultry and killed 35,286 across all the farms, out of a total of 170,389 birds. The surviving birds were culled to prevent further disease spread.\n  The same virus struck two farms in Bulgaria yesterday, both in Plovdiv province in south central Bulgaria. One housed more than 11,000 birds and the second almost five times that number. The high-path H5N8 virus killed 54 poultry on both farms combined, out of 67,037 birds. This is the first report of this avian flu strain in the country.\nFeb 25 OIE report on H5N6 in Vietnam\nFeb 25 OIE report on H5N8 in Poland\nFeb 24 OIE report on H5N8 in Bulgaria",

Because of its ability to disrupt biofilm formation, PLG0206 will be initially aimed at treating serious infections associated with implants such as prosthetic knees and hips.\n  \"Joint replacements are an increasingly common surgical procedure, and infections are the most serious and costly complication of joint replacements,\" Erin Duffy, PhD, chief of research and development at CARB-X (The Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator), said in a press release. \"The project is still in the early phases of development, but if successful and approved for use in patients, it could represent tremendous improvement in the treatment of periprosthetic joint infections.\"\n  Peptilogics could receive up to $9.61 million in additional funding if the project achieves certain development milestones.\n  Since launching in 2016, CARB-X has awarded more than $195.6 million to support the development of new antibiotics, diagnostics, vaccines, and other products to combat drug-resistant infections.\nFeb 25 CARB-X press release\nNew drug for complicated urinary tract infections available in US  Drug maker Shionogi & Co. of Osaka, Japan, announced yesterday that cefiderocol, a newly approved antibiotic for treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) caused by gram-negative bacteria is now available for US adults who have limited or no treatment options.\n  Cefiderocol, sold under the brand name Fetroja, is a cephalosporin antibiotic with a novel mechanism of penetrating the tough outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and the ability to overcome resistance mechanism used by gram-negative pathogens to evade antibiotics. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on Nov 14, 2019, based on results from a phase 2 clinical trial.\n  \"The infectious disease community faces a serious challenge in combating cUTIs caused by Gram-negative pathogens, leading to high mortality rates,\" Shionogi president and CEO Akira Kato, PhD, said in a company news release. \"This illustrates a dire need for a treatment option able to overcome many mechanisms of resistance in Gram-negative bacteria.\"\n  The labeling for cefiderocol comes with a warning about higher all-cause mortality found in patients with highly drug-resistant infections who were treated with the drug in another clinical trial, compared with patients treated with the best available therapy. The cause of the increase in mortality has not been established.\nFeb 24 Shionogi press release\n\nOIE: 77% of nations don't use antibiotics to promote animal growth  The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) yesterday said more than three fourths of countries do not use any antibiotics for animal growth promotion, according to findings in its fourth annual report on global use of antibiotics in food-producing animals.\n  The report includes information on veterinary antibiotic use submitted by 153 OIE members in 2018, an increase of 18% since data collections began in 2015. Of these 153 countries, 118 (77%) provided data on quantities of antimicrobial agents sold for use in food-producing animals, an increase of 33% since 2015. Most countries (111 of 118, 94%) submitted data for only 1 year from 2016 to 2018. Progress was observed from 31 countries that had reported barriers in reporting quantitative antibiotic data during previous rounds of data collection.\n  A total of 118 countries (77%) reported that they did not use any antibiotics for growth promotion in animals as of 2018, either with or without legislation or regulations.\n  The report also includes an estimate of antibiotic use adjusted by animal biomass in 92 countries, which helps provide context for antibiotic sales data and can help explain trends and fluctuations in antibiotic use over time and between regions. The global estimate of antibiotics used in animals in 2016 adjusted by animal biomass was 144.39 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg).\n  Regional comparison showed that Asia, the Far East, and Oceania reported the most antibiotics intended for use in animals (273.72 mg/kg) among the four global regions. Comparisons of the 2016 data with data from 2014 and 2015 showed that Europe's reported antibiotic use adjusted by animal biomass fell from 2014 to 2016, while Africa's remained at a similar level despite the contributions from more countries, and animal antibiotic use rose in the Americas. But the OIE cautions that changes in reporting countries and in regional biomass coverage across years of analysis, as well as differences in species composition, leave room for uncertainty.\n  The OIE says that, as more data on animal populations become globally available, the methodology for calculation of animal biomass will be refined.\nFeb 24 OIE report",

NPIs, also known as community mitigation measures, are actions that persons and communities can take to help slow the spread of respiratory virus infections, including seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses.\n\nThese guidelines replace the 2007 Interim Pre-pandemic Planning Guidance: Community Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Mitigation in the United States \u2014 Early, Targeted, Layered Use of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/11425). Several elements remain unchanged from the 2007 guidance, which described recommended NPIs and the supporting rationale and key concepts for the use of these interventions during influenza pandemics. NPIs can be phased in, or layered, on the basis of pandemic severity and local transmission patterns over time. Categories of NPIs include personal protective measures for everyday use (e.g., voluntary home isolation of ill persons, respiratory etiquette, and hand hygiene); personal protective measures reserved for influenza pandemics (e.g., voluntary home quarantine of exposed household members and use of face masks in community settings when ill); community measures aimed at increasing social distancing (e.g., school closures and dismissals, social distancing in workplaces, and postponing or cancelling mass gatherings); and environmental measures (e.g., routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces).\n\nSeveral new elements have been incorporated into the 2017 guidelines. First, to support updated recommendations on the use of NPIs, the latest scientific evidence available since the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 pandemic has been added. Second, a summary of lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response is presented to underscore the importance of broad and flexible prepandemic planning. Third, a new section on community engagement has been included to highlight that the timely and effective use of NPIs depends on community acceptance and active participation. Fourth, to provide new or updated pandemic assessment and planning tools, the novel influenza virus pandemic intervals tool, the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool, the Pandemic Severity Assessment Framework, and a set of prepandemic planning scenarios are described. Finally, to facilitate implementation of the updated guidelines and to assist states and localities with prepandemic planning and decision-making, this report links to six supplemental prepandemic NPI planning guides for different community settings that are available online (https://www.cdc.gov/nonpharmaceutical-interventions)....",

The cases were reported from Aseer (7 cases), Riyadh (6 cases), Al-Qassim (2 cases), Eastern (2 cases), Madinah (1 case), and Aljouf (1 case) regions. In January 2020, a hospital outbreak was reported in Aseer region with a cluster of 6 cases. Three of the cases were health care workers, two were patients and one was a visitor. One of the cases of this cluster died on 4 February 2020. \n\nThe link below provides details of the 19 reported cases:MERS-CoV cases reported from 1 December 2019 through 31 January 2020\nxls, 124kb\n\nFrom 2012 until 31 January 2020, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2519 with 866 associated deaths. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.  WHO risk assessmentInfection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. \n\nThe notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedaries, animal products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting). \n\nWHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.  WHO adviceBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. \n\nInfection prevention and control measures (IPC) are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. \n\nEarly identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV. \n\nMERS-CoV causes more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close unprotected contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. \n\nFood hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

Of the 72,314 cases, 44,672 were classified as confirmed cases of COVID-19 (62%; diagnosis based on positive throat swab samples), 16,186 as suspected cases (diagnosis based on symptoms and exposures only), 10,567 as clinically diagnosed cases (from Hubei province only, diagnoses based on symptoms, including lung x-ray), and 889 as asymptomatic cases (diagnosis by positive test result but lacking typical symptoms).\n  \"Most cases were diagnosed in Hubei Province (75%) and most reported Wuhan-related exposures (86%; ie, Wuhan resident or visitor or close contact with Wuhan resident or visitor,\" the authors said.\n  Eighty-seven percent of patients were aged 30 to 79 years (38,680 cases). This age-group was the most affected by a wide margin, followed by ages 20 to 29 (3,619 cases, or 8%), those 80 and older (1,408 cases, or 3%), and 1% each in ages less than 10 and 10 to 19 years.\n  Of the confirmed cases, 1,023 patients\u2014all in critical condition\u2014died from the virus, which results in a CFR of 2.3%. The CFR jumped considerably among older patients, to 14.8% in patients 80 and older, and 8.0% in patients ages 70 to 79. Among the critically ill, the CFR was 49.0%.\n  A smaller study today based on 52 critically ill patients at a Wuhan hospital confirms this finding. Thirty-two of the 52 critically ill patients (61.5%) died, and older age and acute respiratory distress syndrome were correlated with mortality.\n  The authors of the smaller study also found that 30 (81%) of 37 patients requiring mechanical ventilation had died by 28 days.\nLess deadly but more transmissible than SARS, MERS  A total of 81% of cases in the JAMA study were classified as mild, meaning they did not result in pneumonia or resulted in only mild pneumonia. Fourteen percent of cases were severe (marked by difficulty breathing), and 5% were critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure).\n  In comparison to SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) coronaviruses, which were both identified in the past 20 years, COVID-19 is likely more highly transmissible but not as deadly, the researchers noted. (SARS had a CFR of 9.6%; MERS has a CFR of 34.4%.) And unlike SARS and MERS, hospital-based outbreaks do not seem to be hallmark of COVID-19 at this time.\n  \"Most secondary transmission of SARS and MERS occurred in the hospital setting,\" the authors wrote. \"Transmission of COVID-19 is occurring in this context as well\u20143019 cases have been observed among health workers as of February 11, 2020 (of whom there have been 1716 confirmed cases and 5 deaths). However, this is not a major means of COVID-19 spread. Rather, it appears that considerable transmission is occurring among close contacts.\"\nCruise ship study suggest R0 of 2.28  In other research news, a study in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases uses data from the Diamond Princess cruise ship to calculate COVID-19's reproductive number (R0, or R-naught), or the number of people a single infected person is likely to infect.\n  Among the 355 passengers who contracted the virus, the researchers calculated an R0 of 2.28, similar to other R0 modeling published in the past several weeks.\n  Also today, two groups announced major developments in COVID-19 vaccine developments.  China's Clover Biopharmaceuticals will partner with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) on Clover's protein-based coronavirus vaccine candidate, COVID-19 S-Trimer, according to a GSK news release. And the University of Queensland in Australia announced a vaccine candidate is ready for a proof-of-concept study after just 3 weeks in development.\nReuters said that globally researchers are developing at least 12 COVID-19 vaccines.",

He said the decline in China's cases is real, and that the epidemic peaked and plateaued between Jan 23 and Feb 2 and has been steadily declining since then.\n  He said the group found that the fatality rate ranges from 2% to 4% in Wuhan, but is lower at 0.7% outside of the city. For people with mild disease, recovery takes about 2 weeks, but patients who experience severe or critical disease it may take 3 to 6 weeks to recover.\n  The group concluded that China's strict measures averted a significant number of cases, Tedros said, adding that the team highlights remaining unanswered questions and makes 22 recommendations. He said joint mission leader Bruce Aylward, MD, MPH, will brief reporters on more details.\n  Addressing speculation on whether the recent escalating events constitute a pandemic, Tedros said health officials are still gauging the geographic spread, disease severity, and COVID-19's impact on societies. \"For the moment, we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus, and we are not witnessing large-scale disease or death,\" he said.\n  Though the sudden surges in in some parts of the world are concerning, the word \"pandemic\" doesn't fit the facts and may raise fears, he said. Rather, he said as the WHO continuously monitors the epidemic, countries must make their own risk assessments, with an eye toward prioritizing three things: protecting healthcare workers, protecting people most at risk (older people and those with chronic health conditions), and protecting countries with weaker health systems.\n  Mike Ryan, MD, who directs the WHO's health emergencies program, said making the pandemic call for flu would be an easier call, since health officials know what to expect with the spread. However, he added that experts still don't understand all the dynamics related to COVID-19. He added that the world is in a phase of preparing for a potential pandemic.\nFive Middle Eastern countries report first cases, Iran's outbreak expands  The five Middle Eastern countries reporting their first cases today include Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq, and Oman, the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean regional office confirmed on Twitter.\n  Afghanistan's health ministry said its first confirmed case is one of three suspected cases, which were flagged in Herat province in the western part of the country on the border with Iran, Channel News Asia reported today, citing Afghanistan's health minister. One of the three people had recently returned from city of Qom, which is Iran's outbreak epicenter.\n  Bahrain's health ministry said its first confirmed case is a Bahraini citizen who had symptoms upon returning from Iran, Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported today.  Meanwhile, Kuwait reported three cases, all traveling from Iran, one in a Kuwaiti citizen, one in a Saudi citizen, and the other with an unspecified nationality, according to a separate KUNA report.\n  Iraq's health ministry said its case is a religious studies student from Iran. Oman health ministry reported two cases, both of them Omani women who had visited Iran, Reuters reported today.\n  Meanwhile, Iran's health ministry today reported 18 new cases and 4 more deaths, raising its totals to 61 cases, 12 of them fatal. Eight of the cases are from Qom, with the others from Tehran (3), Markazi province (2), Isfahan province (2), Guilan province (2), Hamedan province (1). All are in the northwestern part of the country.\n  At today's WHO media briefing, officials said a WHO expert team is slated to arrive in Iran tomorrow to assistant and support the country's health officials.\nSouth Korea total tops 800, relative of US service member tests positive  The South Korea Centers for Disease Control (KCDC) in three updates (161 cases, 207 cases, and 70 cases), reported 438 new infections today, raising its total to 833. The country also reported 8 more deaths, raising the fatality count to 11.\n  In a summary of the first 763 cases, it said most of the cases are still linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus cluster, with 186 cases are linked to an ongoing hospital cluster in Daegu.\n  In other South Korea developments, the family member of a US service member has tested positive for the virus, US Forces Korea (USFK) said in a statement today. The patient is a 61-year-old woman living in Daegu who visited Camp Walker's Post Exchange on Feb 12 and Feb 15. KCDC and USFK health officials are tracing contacts and the USFK has raised its risk level to high.\nItaly cases rise, ECDC notes transmission in hospitals  Since yesterday, Italy has reported 97 more cases, boosting its total to 229, including 6 deaths, according to an update from the health ministry.\n  The outbreak is still concentrated in four northern regions, including Lombardy (172), Veneto (33), and Emilia Romagna (18), and Piedmont (3). There are also three cases in Lazio region near Rome (including two Chinese tourists). Of the 222 people who are still under observation or treatment, 94 are in home isolation, and of 101 hospitalized patients, 27 are receiving intensive care unit (ICU) treatment.\n  In a related development, the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has issued a risk assessment, based on Italy's outbreak. It said local transmission is occurring with, cases linked to hospitals in both healthcare workers and patients. It said the situation in Italy is dynamic, with more cases expected on the days ahead, and so far, no close contacts or other related cases have been reported in other European countries.\n  It said the risk to people in the European Union and the United Kingdom is low to moderate, due to strong efforts in Italy to identify, isolate, and test contacts. It added that the possibility of new introductions from countries outside of China is increasing and that the risk of clusters similar to the ones in Italy is moderate to high. It said the impact would be moderate to high, especially if hospitals are affected and large numbers of healthcare workers are isolated. It said the threat to health systems during the peak of flu season, which is past peak in some countries, is low to moderate.\n  The WHO today announced a joint mission with the ECDC, which arrived in Italy today to support Italian authorities. It said though limited local spread outside China is expected, the rapid increase in Italy over the past 2 days is concerning.\nChina numbers  China today reported 409 new cases, down from 648 reported yesterday, raising the overall outbreak total to 77,150 cases, the country's National Health Commission said today in its daily update. Also, it reported 150 more deaths and 1,053 fewer serious cases, putting those respective totals at 2,592 and 9,915.\n  In other developments, China's government today announced an immediate and comprehensive ban on the trade and consumption of wild animals, which is suspected as the cause of the COVID-19 outbreak, Agence France-Presse reported today, citing a state TV report.\nMore cases in Japan, Singapore, and Canada  Japan's health ministry today reported 12 more cases, raising its total to 139, though it notes an overall total of 156 that includes 16 asymptomatic carriers and 1 positive confirmed case. The newest cases were reported from Ishikawa prefecture, Sapporo, North Kaido, Kanagawa, Tokyo, and Sagamihara.\n  In separate reports, the health ministry also reported two Diamond Princess cruise ship related cases in outbreak responders, one of them a quarantine officer and the other a health ministry employee.\n  Singapore's health ministry today reported one more case, raising the country's total to 90. The latest case is linked to a church cluster. So far, only 9 local cases don't have known links.\n  Elsewhere, Canada reported one more presumed positive case, which would raise its total to 10. Ontario health officials said the woman arrived from China on Feb 21 and was seen at North York General Hospital for an intermittent cough that was improving. Given that her illness was mild, she was discharged for self-isolation at home.\n  The WHO said in its daily situation update today that over the past 24 hours it has received reports of 300 new cases outside of China, 6 of them fatal, raising the total to 2,069 cases and 23 deaths from 29 countries. Of those cases, 695 are linked to the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan.\nMore cases in US Diamond Princess evacuees, CDC posts two more travel notices  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today reported 18 more cases in repatriated Americans, all apparently from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. So far, 53 cases have been reported, which includes 12 previously reported travel-linked cases and 2 in their contacts.\n  Also, the CDC yesterday posted two new travel notices, one for Iran and the other for Italy, both due to the spread of COVID-19 to the countries. Both are classified as \"watch\" level, the lowest of the CDC's three levels, which urges travelers to practice usual precautions.\n  In its latest risk assessment today, the CDC said the spread of the COVID-19 virus is a rapidly evolving situation and that as community spread is detected in more and more countries, the world is moving closer to meeting pandemic criteria.\n  \"The potential public health threat posed by COVID-19 is high, both globally and to the United States,\" the CDC said, adding that the immediate risk to the American general public is low, but is higher for healthcare workers and close contacts of confirmed patients. It warned that current trends suggests the virus will likely cause a pandemic, which would change its risk assessment.",

The aim was to see whether use of different antibiotics in the community might be linked to rising rates of hospitalization with sepsis and associated mortality.\n  The results of the analysis suggest a positive association between rates of outpatient prescribing of oral penicillins and rates of mortality with sepsis in individuals aged 75 to 84 years and those 85 and older.\n  An increase in the rate of prescribing of oral penicillins by 1 annual dose per 1,000 state residents was associated with increases in annual rates of mortality with sepsis of 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02 to 1.88) per 1,000 persons aged 75 to 84 years, and 2.97 (95% CI, 0.72 to 5.22) per 1,000 persons over 85. Additionally, the percent of individuals among those aged 50 to 64 who lacked health insurance and the percent of individuals aged 65 to 84 who were African-American were both associated with higher rates of mortality with sepsis in the corresponding age-groups.\n  The authors of the study note that the findings support the results of a previous analysis that showed an association between the use of penicillins and rates of septicemia hospitalization in older US adults, and are also in agreement with the fact that prevalence of resistance to penicillins, particularly in older adults, is high for a variety of gram-negative and gram-positive infections.\n  They conclude, \"While these findings support the potential utility of replacement of penicillins by other antibiotics with the goal of reducing the rates of sepsis and associated mortality, further studies, including individual-level analyses are needed to better understand the effect of replacement of certain antibiotics, particularly penicillins by other antibiotics in the treatment of different syndromes, well as the effect of reduction in antibiotic prescribing in the treatment of certain conditions on the rates of severe outcomes associated with bacterial infections.\"\nFeb 22 BMC Infect Dis study\nRapid test for tigecycline resistance genes performs well in lab study  A simple, rapid, and cost-effective assay for detecting genes that confer high-level resistance to tigecycline showed high sensitivity and specificity in lab tests, Chinese researchers reported today in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.\n  The assay, called the tetracycline inactivation method (TIM), was developed to detect the tet(X3/X4) genes, which are present on mobile plasmids and can directly inactivate tetracycline antibiotics, including the newly approved eravacycline and omadacycline. The test uses Bacillus stearothermophilus as the indicator strain, coupled with a pH-sensitive dye (bromecresol purple), to determine the production of tet(X3/X4) in bacterial strains. If the test strain carries the plasmid-encoded tet(X3/X4) genes, eravacycline will be degraded, allowing the growth of the susceptible indicator strain, and a yellow colorimetric zone will develop; otherwise, the color will be purple.\n  To evaluate the TIM assay, researchers from South China Agricultural University tested it on 118 isolates obtained from feces, soil, dust, sewage, and vegetable samples, including 30 tet(X4)-positive Escherichia coli, 30 tet(X3)-positive Acinetobacter spp., and 58 tet-negative E coli and Acinetobacter spp. The results showed the sensitivity and specificity for E coli carrying tet(X4) was 96.7% and 100%, respectively, while sensitivity and susceptibility for Acinetobacter spp. carrying tet(X3) were both 100%. The assay can be completed in 6.5 hours.\n  \"Overall, the high sensitivity and specificity of TIM combined with its rapid readout make it a useful tool in clinical microbiology laboratories for the detection of plasmid-mediated high-level tigecycline resistance in E. coli and Acinetobacter spp.,\" the authors of the study write. They add that evaluation off the assay in clinical samples is worth further study.\nFeb 24 J Antimicrob Chemother study\nFDA grants breakthrough status to lysin therapy for MRSA bloodstream infections  Biotechnology company ContraFect Corporation, of Yonkers, New York, announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to execabase, a recombinantly produced lysin, for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections.\n  According to a company press release, the designation was based on results of a phase 2 superiority trial that evaluated whether the addition of execabase to standard-of-care (SOC) antibiotic therapy in patients with S aureus bloodstream infections improved clinical response rates compared with SOC antibiotic therapy alone. In a pre-specified analysis of the subgroup with MRSA infections, the clinical responder rate at day 14 among exebacase-treated patients was 42.8 percentage points higher than the responder rate among patients treated with SOC antibiotics alone (74.1% vs 31.3%, respectively, P = 0.010).\n  Treatment with exebacase was also associated with a 21-percentage-point reduction in the 30-day all-cause mortality (P = 0.056), a 4-day reduction in length of hospital stay, and meaningful reductions in 30-day hospital readmission rates in MRSA-infected patients.\n  \"The decision by the FDA to grant Breakthrough Therapy designation to exebacase recognizes the urgent need for new therapies that can impact the lives of patients with these MRSA infections,\" ContraFect President and CEO Roger Pomerantz, MD, said. \"Based on the Phase 2 data, we believe exebacase could be the first anti-infective agent to demonstrate superior outcomes for these patients.\"\n  Execebase is the first lysin to enter human clinical trials in the United States. It works by targeting the peptidoglycan cell wall, which is vital to S aureus bacteria.\n  Breakthrough Therapy designation expedites development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases that have provided preliminary clinical evidence that they may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies on at least one clinically significant end point.\nFeb 24 ContraFect press release",

Let me start, as always, with the latest numbers.\n  As of 6am Geneva time this morning, China has reported a total of 77,362 cases of COVID-19 to WHO, including 2618 deaths.\n  In the past 24 hours, China has reported 416 new confirmed cases, and 150 deaths.\n  We\u2019re encouraged by the continued decline in cases in China.\n  Earlier today the WHO-China joint mission concluded its visit and delivered its report.\n  As you know, the team has traveled to several different provinces, including Wuhan.\n  The team has made a range of findings about the transmissibility of the virus, the severity of disease and the impact of the measures taken.\n  They found that the epidemic peaked and plateaued between the 23rd of January and the 2nd of February, and has been declining steadily since then.\n  They have found that there has been no significant change in the DNA of the virus.\n  They found that the fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan, and 0.7% outside Wuhan.\n  They found that for people with mild disease, recovery time is about two weeks, while people with severe or critical disease recover within three to six weeks.\n  The team also estimate that the measures taken in China have averted a significant number of cases.\n  The report contains a wealth of other information, highlights questions for which we still don\u2019t have answers, and includes 22 recommendations.\n  Dr Bruce Aylward will give more detail tomorrow on behalf of the joint team.\n  But the key message that should give all countries hope, courage and confidence is that this virus can be contained.\n  Indeed, there are many countries that have done exactly that.\n  Outside China, there are now 2074 cases in 28 countries, and 23 deaths.\n  The sudden increases of cases in Italy, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Korea are deeply concerning.\n  There\u2019s a lot of speculation about whether these increases mean that this epidemic has now become a pandemic.\n  We understand why people ask that question.\n  WHO has already declared a public health emergency of international concern \u2013 our highest level of alarm \u2013 when there were less than 100 cases outside China, and 8 cases of human-to-human transmission.\n  Our decision about whether to use the word \u201cpandemic\u201d to describe an epidemic is based on an ongoing assessment of the geographical spread of the virus, the severity of disease it causes and the impact it has on the whole of society.\n  For the moment, we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus, and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or death.\n  Does this virus have pandemic potential? Absolutely, it has. Are we there yet? From our assessment, not yet.\n  So how should we describe the current situation?\n  What we see are epidemics in different parts of the world, affecting countries in different ways and requiring a tailored response.\n  The sudden increase in new cases is certainly very concerning.\n  I have spoken consistently about the need for facts, not fear.\n  Using the word pandemic now does not fit the facts, but it may certainly cause fear.\n  This is not the time to focus on what word we use.\n  That will not prevent a single infection today, or save a single life today.\n  This is a time for all countries, communities, families and individuals to focus on preparing.\n  We do not live in a binary, black-and-white world.\n  It\u2019s not either-or. We must focus on containment, while doing everything we can to prepare for a potential pandemic.\n  There is no one-size-fits-all approach. Every country must make its own risk assessment for its own context. WHO is also continuing to do its own risk assessment and is monitoring the evolution of the epidemic around the clock.\n  But there are at least three priorities.\n  First, all countries must prioritize protecting health workers.\n  Second, we must engage communities to protect people who are most at risk of severe disease, particularly the elderly and people with underlying health conditions.\n  And third, we must protect countries that are the most vulnerable, by doing our utmost to contain epidemics in countries with the capacity to do it.\n  In the past few days I have held meetings with the foreign ministers of France, Germany, Indonesia, Cuba and the Republic of Korea, and I want to thank them for agreeing to support the response.\n  I also wish to thank the European Commission for its contribution of 232 million euros, which demonstrates the kind of global solidarity that gives me hope. France, Germany and Sweden have also announced additional contributions.\n  This is a shared threat. We can only face it together, and we can only overcome it together.\n  When we act together \u2013 countries, regional and global health organizations, the media, the private sector, and people everywhere \u2013 our collective strength is formidable.\n  Alone, we lose. Together, we win.\n  I thank you.",

Sandman\n\nNOTE FROM IAN: The expert risk communication team of Lanard and Sandman has given me permission to post their very well-considered reply to my question of them just on 24 hours ago, here. I\u2019m not an expert in this space so I sought their very experienced thoughts about changing my tone around the COVID-19 multi-country epidemic before I started doing so yesterday. Here is what they had to say\u2026 We are starting to hear from experts and officials who now believe a COVID-19 pandemic is more and more likely.  They want to use the \u201cP word,\u201d and also start talking more about what communities and individuals can and should do to prepare.  On February 22, Australian virologist Ian Mackay asked us for our thoughts on this phase of COVID-19 risk communication. \n\nHere is our response. Yes, it is past time to say \u201cpandemic\u201d \u2013 and to stop saying \u201cstop\u201dIt\u2019s a good time to think about how to use the \u201cP word\u201d (pandemic) in talking about COVID-19.  Or rather, it is past time.\n\nIt is important to help people understand that while you think \u2013 if you do think so \u2013 that this is going to be pandemic in terms of becoming very widespread,  no one knows yet how much severe disease there will be around the world over short periods of time.  \u201cWill it be a mild, or moderate, or severe pandemic?  Too soon to say, but at the moment, there are some tentative signs that\u2026.\u201d  \n\nThe most crucial (and overdue) risk communication task for the next few days is to help people visualize their communities when \u201ckeeping it out\u201d \u2013 containment \u2013 is no longer relevant.  The P word is a good way to launch this message.  \n\nBut the P word alone won\u2019t help the public understand what\u2019s about to change: the end of most quarantines, travel restrictions, contact tracing, and other measures designed to keep \u201cthem\u201d from infecting \u201cus,\u201d and the switch to measures like canceling mass events designed to keep us from infecting each other.  \n\nWe are near-certain that the desperate-sounding last-ditch containment messaging of recent days is contributing to a massive global misperception about the near-term future.  The theme of WHO\u2019s and many governments\u2019 messages \u2013 that the \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to stop spread of the virus is closing \u2013 is like the famous cover page of Nevil Shute\u2019s On the Beach: \u201cThere is still time \u2026 Brother.\u201d\n\nFor weeks we have been trying to get officials to talk early about the main goal of containment: to slow the spread of the virus, not to stop it.  And to explain that containment efforts would eventually end.  And to help people learn about \u201cafter containment.\u201d  This risk communication has not happened yet in most places....\n\nSo here is one more pitch for openness about containment.  Officials: Please read Containment as Signal, Swine Flu Risk Miscommunication, which we wrote in 2009.  \n\nOne horrible effect of this continued \u201cstop the pandemic\u201d daydream masquerading as a policy goal: It is driving counter-productive and outrage-inducing measures by many countries against travelers from other countries, even their own citizens back from other countries.  But possibly more horrible: The messaging is driving resources toward \u201cstopping,\u201d and away from the main potential benefit of containment \u2013 slowing the spread of the pandemic and thereby buying a little more time to prepare for what\u2019s coming. \n\nWe hope that governments and healthcare institutions are using this time wisely.  We know that ordinary citizens are not being asked to do so.  In most countries \u2013 including our United States and your Australia \u2013 ordinary citizens have not been asked to prepare.  Instead, they have been led to expect that their governments will keep the virus from their doors. Take the risk of scaring peopleWhenever we introduce the word \u201cpandemic,\u201d it\u2019s important to validate that it\u2019s a scary word \u2013 both to experts and to non-experts \u2013 because it justifiably contains the implication of something potentially really bad, and definitely really disruptive, for an unknown period of time.  This implication is true and unavoidable, even if the overall pattern of disease ends up being mild, like the 2009-10 \u201cswine flu\u201d pand....\nIt\u2019s simply not true, in principle or in practice, that you are damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t!  Over-alarming risk messages are far more forgivable than over-reassuring ones. Push people to prepare, and guide their prep This is the most culpabl......\n\nHardly any officials are telling civil society and the general public how to get ready for this pandemic.\n\nEven officials who say very alarming things about the prospects of a pandemic mostly focus on how their agencies are preparing, not on how the people they misperceive as \u201caudience\u201d should prepare.  \u201cAudience\u201d is the wrong frame.  We are all stakeholders, and we don\u2019t just want to hear what officials are doing.  We want to hear what we can do too.  \n\nWe want \u2013 and need \u2013 to hear advice like this:Try to get a few extra months\u2019 worth of prescription meds, if possible.\nThink through now how we will take care of sick family members while trying not to get infected.\nCross-train key staff at work so one person\u2019s absence won\u2019t derail our organization\u2019s ability to function.\nPractice touching our faces less. So how about a face-counter app like the step-counters so many of us use?\nReplace handshakes with elbow-bumps (the \u201cEbola handshake\u201d).\nStart building harm-reduction habits like pushing elevator buttons with a knuckle instead of a fingertip.\n\nThere is so much for people to do, and to practice doing in advance. Preparedness is emotional tooSuggesting things people can do to prepare for a possible hard time to come doesn\u2019t just get them better prepared logistically.  It also helps get them better prepared emotionally.  It helps get them through the Oh My God (OMG) moment everyone needs to have, and needs to get through, preferably without being accused of hysteria.\n.....roving. \n\nAnd you can work on your new habit alone, and also in a pro-social communitarian way.  Others can help you do it, and you can help them. \n\nAnd it yields real harm reduction!  It is arguably the endpoint of what washing your hands is for, and it helps when you can\u2019t wash your hands out in the world.\n\nLike all good pandemic preparedness recommendations, it helps you rehearse emotionally, as well as logistically.  The bottom lineEvery single official we know is having multiple \u201cOh my God\u201d moments, as new COVID-19 developments occur and new findings emerge.  OMG \u2013 there is a fair amount of transmission by infected people with mild or subclinical cases!  OMG \u2013 there is a high viral load early on in nasal and pharyngeal samples!  OMG \u2013 the Diamond Princess, how can that have been allowed to happen!  And on and on....\nhttps://virologydownunder.com/past-t...l-prepare-now/",

This is the highest number of child flu deaths at this point in the season since the CDC started keeping records in 2004, except for the 2009 flu pandemic.\n\nIt has been an \"unusual\" flu season with a higher proportion of children and young adults affected than the older population, according to Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\nThe earlier prevalence of influenza B -- a flu strain that tends to be more common in children -- could be a reason why more children were affected, Schaffner said. Also, as the number of influenza B cases decreased, the number of H1N1 cases increased, he said. H1N1 is a subtype of the influenza A strain, which also affects children more than adults...",

The cases were diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on 6 February and microbiological characterization identified the cases as serotype 2 (DENV 2 by PCR). Laboratory confirmation was performed at the national reference laboratory of the Chile Institute of Public Health on 6 February 2020. \n\nThese are the first confirmed cases of dengue due to DENV 2 reported on Easter Island in 2020. The cases are females with ages ranging from 27 to 49 years. The dates of symptom onset were between 27 January to 6 February 2020. None of the cases reported any travel history.\n\nIn 2000, the presence of the vector, A. aegypti, was confirmed on Easter Island. The first dengue outbreak was reported in 2002 and was due to DENV 1. In 2009, two autochthonous DENV 4 cases were detected and in 2016, 2017 and 2018, cases due to DENV 1 were reported (33, 2 and 18 cases, respectively). In 2019, a total of 38 dengue cases were reported on Easter Island (28 autochthonous DENV 1 cases, nine imported cases from Tahiti (four DENV 1 and five DENV 2 cases), and one probable autochthonous DENV 1 case). No severe dengue cases were reported in 2019.\n\nSince 2009, no other serotypes besides DENV 1 have been identified in autochthonous cases until the beginning of 2020.\n\nThe density of competent vectors on Easter Island could potentially contribute to the spread of the disease throughout the island.  Public health responseActions implemented by local public health authorities are as follows:Strengthening active and passive epidemiological surveillance, including syndromic surveillance.\nStrengthening and intensifying vector surveillance and control.\nProviding training to healthcare professionals on early detection of warning signs of severe disease and appropriate clinical management of patients with dengue.\nImplementing a risk communication strategy for local awareness.\nWHO risk assessmentDengue fever is a febrile illness that affects infants, young children, and adults, with symptoms ranging from mild fever to high fever, with headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and rash. It is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected with one of the four dengue virus serotypes.\n\nThe introduction of serotype DENV 2 into this population, majority of which already have primary infection with DENV 1, can pose a potential risk for severe dengue cases due to secondary infections.\n\nEaster Island has a subtropical climate. The average annual temperature is 20.5\u00b0C with small variations between seasons that do not usually exceed 7\u00b0C. Summer runs from 21 December to 21 March, with January and February being the warmest months with an average maximum temperature of 28\u00b0C and minimum temperature of 15\u00b0C.\n\nEaster Island has weekly air transport connections with French Polynesia, where there is an ongoing dengue outbreak with predominantly DENV 2. Additionally, due to the presence of the competent vector and, given that Easter Island is a popular tourist destination, the risk of spread to neighboring islands and countries cannot be ruled out.  WHO adviceIn light of the increase in dengue cases and possible severe dengue cases in several countries and territories of the Region of the Americas especially in 2019, PAHO/WHO encourages Member States to follow the key recommendations regarding outbreak preparedness and response, case management, laboratory, and integrated vector management (IVM) as published in the 21 November 2018 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Alert on Dengue and the 11 November 2019 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on Dengue. \n\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue; however, the timely detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue, and appropriate case management are key elements of care to prevent patient deaths due to dengue. A delay in seeking medical care in severe dengue cases is often related to deaths from dengue virus disease.\n\nAdditionally, IVM activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure. This should include both larval and adult vector control strategies (i.e. environmental management and source reduction and chemical control measures). Vector control measures should be implemented at households, places of work, schools, and healthcare facilities, among others, to prevent the vector-person contact.\n\nGiven that Aedes mosquitoes, the competent vector, have greater activity during the day, personal protection measures are recommended such as the use of protective clothing that minimizes skin exposure and repellents that can be applied to exposed skin or clothes; the use of repellents must be in strict accordance with the label instructions. Window and door screens, and mosquito nets (impregnated or not with insecticide), can be useful to reduce the vector-person contact in closed spaces during the day or night. Community supported source reduction measures should be initiated, and vector surveillance and control implemented.\n\nFor more information, please see the following links:Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization.

In addition, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) became the third country to report Iran-linked cases.\n  In other developments, China reported more cases and added to its death total, and officials in the United States detailed plans to house evacuees and test surveillance samples.\nWHO chief warns Africa  In the wake of warning earlier this week that the window for containing COVID-19 has narrowed, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, met with African health ministers in an emergency meeting about preparedness, which was organized by the African Union and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  The WHO has voiced deep concern over the potential spread of the virus to countries with weak health systems, especially those in Africa.\n  Though 80% of patients have mild disease and recover, the other 20% have severe or critical disease, he said in a speech today before the group. \"These patients require intensive care, using equipment such as respiratory support machines that are, as you know, in short supply in many African countries. And that's a cause for concern.\"\nMany Korea cases part of 2 clusters  In two separate reports today, South Korea's Centers for Disease Control (KCDC) first reported 142 cases then reported 87 more for a total of 433, more than double the 204 reported yesterday. Of the new cases, 100 are from a Shincheonji Church of Jesus cluster, and 95 are linked to a cluster at Qingdao Daenam Hospital in Cheongdo County. Health officials also reported South Korea's second death from the virus.\n  The KCDC also published a summary of its first 346 cases, which shows that 48.8% are linked to the church cluster and 31.2% are linked to the hospital cluster.\n  It also has details about the hospital outbreak, which is centered in the facility's psychiatric ward and has so far sickened 9 staff and 102 patients. South Korea's two deaths are linked to the hospital outbreak. The report also notes that transmission linked to the church likely reflects repeated exposures, such as during small group meetings.\nJapan Singapore totals grow  Meanwhile, Japan's health ministry today reported 22 more cases, raising the country's total to 113, though it also notes an overall total of 132 that includes 16 asymptomatic carriers and 3 confirmed positives.\n  The cases span 10 locations: Kumamoto City, Kumamoto Prefecture, Wakayama Prefecture, Chiba Prefecture, Hokkaido, Ishikawa Prefecture, Tokyo, Nagoya, Tochigi Prefecture, and Sagamihara.\n  In Singapore, the health ministry reported 3 more cases, raising the country's total to 89. One of the new cases is linked to a church cluster, one involves an evacuee from Wuhan, and the exposure source is under investigation for the third case. In total, only 9 of Singapore's cases don't have links to other cases.\nIran outbreak grows; UAE reports Iran-linked cases  Iran today reported 10 new cases, 1 of them fatal, The News International reported today, citing a health ministry spokesman. Eight patients are hospitalized in Qom, the country's epicenter, with two hospitalized in Tehran.\n  Iran reported its first cases, both fatal, on Feb 20, and today's developments lift the country's total to 28 cases, 5 of them fatal.\n  In a related development, the UAE today reported two cases, involving a couple who had traveled from Iran, according to a health ministry tweet. One of the patients is a 70-year-old man who being treated in an intensive care unit, and the other is his 64-year-old wife. The UAE now has 13 cases.\nItaly reports another death  Italy today reported as many as 11 new cases in its steadily growing outbreak, and there are now 2 fatalities, Reuters reported today, citing healthcare sources quoted in an ANSA news agency report.\n  Italy now has 30 cases in the northern part of the country, 27 of them in Lombardy region. The latest death occurred in a woman from Lombardy.\nChina cases rise  In China, members of an international joint mission led by the WHO is in Wuhan today with their Chinese colleagues to assess the situation. The group has also visited Beijing, plus Sichuan and Guangdong provinces.\n  The country's National Health Commission today reported 397 new cases today, down from 889 reported yesterday, for a total of 76,288.\n  Officials also reported 109 more deaths and 156 fewer suspected cases, putting those respective totals at 2,345 and 11,477.\nCalifornia city blocks evacuee transfer  In US developments, the California city of Costa Mesa has won federal injunction that temporarily bars the transfer of people quarantined at Travis Air Force Base to a state-owned building in Costa Mesa, according to an NBC News report.\n  City officials said about 30 to 50 people, reportedly those who tested positive for the virus, were slated to arrive at the facility as early as Feb 23. The building was once an assisted-living facility for people with disabilities. An expedited hearing is slated for Feb 24.\nHonolulu added as surveillance site  Meanwhile, federal officials have added a sixth site\u2014Honolulu\u2014 to its surveillance system for COVID-19, Anthony Fauci, MD, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during an interview yesterday on CNBC.\n  A recently reported Japanese patient had traveled to Hawaii before he became ill. Last week, federal officials announced the first phase of a plan to look for people who may be infected with the disease at flu surveillance sentinel sites in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, and New York City.\n  Health officials will test negative flu specimens for the virus that causes COVID-19.",

On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization named the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (abbreviated \u201cCOVID-19\u201d).\n\nChinese health officials have reported tens of thousands of cases of COVID-19 in China, with the virus reportedly spreading from person-to-person in parts of that country. COVID-19 illnesses, most of them associated with travel from Wuhan, also are being reported in a growing number of international locations, including the United States. Some person-to-person spread of this virus outside China has been detected. The United States reported the first confirmed instance of person-to-person spread with this virus on January 30, 2020.\n\nOn January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concernexternal icon\u201d (PHEIC). On January 31, 2020, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency (PHE) for the United States to aid the nation\u2019s healthcare community in responding to COVID-19. Also on January 31, the President of the United States signed a presidential \u201cProclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirusexternal icon.\u201d These measures were announced at a press briefing by members of the President\u2019s Coronavirus Task Forceexternal icon.\n\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\n\n\nSource and Spread of the Virus\n\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, both of which have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\n\nEarly on, many of the patients in the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Person-to-person spread has been reported outside China, including in the United States and other countries. Chinese officials report that sustained person-to-person spread in the community is occurring in China. In addition, other destinations have apparent community spread, meaning some people have been infected who are not sure how or where they became infected. Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.\n\nOn This PageBackground\nSource and Spread of the Virus\nSituation in U.S.\nIllness Severity\nRisk Assessment\nWhat to Expect\nCDC Response\nCDC Recommends\nOther Available Resources\n\nConfirmed COVID-19 Cases Global Map\n\nView larger image and see a list of locations\n\nCOVID-19 in the U.S.\n\nView larger image\n\nSituation in U.S.\n\n\nImported cases of COVID-19 in travelers have been detected in the U.S. Person-to-person spread of COVID-19 also has been seen among close contacts of returned travelers from Wuhan, but at this time, this virus is NOT currently spreading in the community in the United States.\n\nThe U.S. government has taken unprecedented stepsexternal icon related to travel in response to the growing public health threat posed by this new coronavirus, including suspending entry in the United States of foreign nationals who have visited China within the past 14 days. Measures monitor the health of those who are allowed entry into the United States (U.S. citizens, residents and family) who have been in China within 14 days also are being implemented. Illness Severity\n\n\nBoth MERS and SARS have been known to cause severe illness in people. The complete clinical picture with regard to COVID-19 is not fully understood. Reported illnesses have ranged from mild to severe, including resulting in death. Learn more about the symptoms associated with COVID-19.\n\nThere are ongoing investigations to learn more. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.\n\n\n\nRisk Assessment\n\n\nOutbreaks of novel virus infections among people are always of public health concern. The risk from these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications).\n\nThe potential public health threat posed by COVID-19 is high, both globally and to the United States. The fact that this disease has caused illness, including illness resulting in death, and sustained person-to-person spread in China is concerning. These factors meet two of the criteria of a pandemic. It\u2019s unclear how the situation will unfold, but risk is dependent on exposure. At this time, some people will have an increased risk of infection, for example healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 and other close contacts of patients with COVID-19. For the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low at this time.\n\n\nWhat to Expect\n\n\nMore cases are likely to be identified in the coming days, including more cases in the United States. It\u2019s also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including in the United States.\n\n\n\nCDC Response\n\n\n\nThis is a picture of CDC\u2019s laboratory test kit for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). CDC is shipping the test kits to laboratories CDC has designated as qualified, including U.S. state and local public health laboratories, Department of Defense (DOD) laboratories and select international laboratories. The test kits are bolstering global laboratory capacity for detecting SARS-CoV-2.\nresize iconView LargerThe federal government is working closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial partners, as well as public health partners, to respond to this public health threat.\nThe public health response is multi-layered, with the goal of detecting and minimizing introductions of this virus in the United States so as to reduce the spread and the impact of this virus.\nCDC established a COVID-19 Incident Management System on January 7, 2020. On January 21, 2020, CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center to better provide ongoing support to the COVID-19 response.\nOn January 27, 2020, CDC issued updated travel guidance for China, recommending that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to all of the country (Level 3 Travel Health Notice).\nOn February 19, 2020, CDC issued travel guidance for Hong Kong and Japan, recommending that travelers practice usual precautions (Level 1).\nThe U.S. government has taken unprecedented steps with respect to travel in response to the growing public health threat posed by this new coronavirus:Effective February 2, 2020, at 5pm, the U.S. government suspended entry of foreign nationals who have been in China within the past 14 days.\nU.S. citizens, residents, and their immediate family members who have been in Hubei province and other parts of mainland China are allowed to enter the United States, but they are subject to health monitoring and possible quarantine for up to 14 days.\nSee more at: \u201cProclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirusexternal icon\u201d.\n\nCDC issued an interim Health Alert Network (HAN) Update to inform state and local health departments and healthcare professionals about this outbreak on February 1, 2020.\nOn January 30, 2020, CDC published guidance for healthcare professionals on the clinical care of COVID-19 patients.\nOn February 3, 2020, CDC posted guidance for assessing the potential risk for various exposures to COVID-19 and managing those people appropriately.\nCDC has deployed multidisciplinary teams to support state health departments with clinical management, contact tracing, and communications.\nCDC has worked with the Department of State, supporting the safe return of Americans who have been stranded as a result of the ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19 and related travel restrictions. CDC has worked to assess the health of passengers as they return to the United States and provided continued daily monitoring of people who are quarantined.\nCDC has developed a real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test that can diagnose COVID-19 in respiratory samples from clinical specimens. On January 24, 2020, CDC publicly posted the assay protocol for this test.\nCDC has been uploading the entire genome of the viruses from reported cases in the United States to GenBank as sequencing was completed.\nCDC has grown the COVID-19 virus in cell culture, which is necessary for further studies, including for additional genetic characterization. The cell-grown virus was sent to NIH\u2019s BEI Resources Repositoryexternal icon for use by the broad scientific community.\nCDC RecommendsWhile the immediate risk of this new virus to the American public is believed to be low at this time, everyone can do their part to help us respond to this emerging public health threat:It\u2019s currently flu and respiratory disease season and CDC recommends getting a flu vaccine, taking everyday preventive actions to help stop the spread of germs, and taking flu antivirals if prescribed.\nIf you are a healthcare provider, be on the look-out for people who recently traveled from China and have fever and respiratory symptoms.\nIf you are a healthcare provider caring for a COVID-19 patient or a public health responder, please take care of yourself and follow recommended infection control procedures.\nIf you have been in China or have been exposed to someone sick with COVID-19 in the last 14 days, you will face some limitations on your movement and activity. Please follow instructions during this time. Your cooperation is integral to the ongoing public health response to try to slow spread of this virus. If you develop COVID-19 symptoms, contact your healthcare provider, and tell them about your symptoms and your travel or exposure to a COVID-19 patient.\nFor people who are ill with COVID-19, please follow CDC guidance on how to reduce the risk of spreading your illness to others.\n\nOther Available Resources\n\n\nThe following resources are available with information on COVID-19U.S. Department of State China Travel Advisoryexternal icon\nWorld Health Organization, Coronavirusexternal icon\n\nPage last reviewed: February 20, 2020",

Real-Time Estimation of the Risk of Death from Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection: Inference Using Exported Cases.Jung SM1, Akhmetzhanov AR1, Hayashi K1, Linton NM1, Yang Y1, Yuan B1, Kobayashi T1, Kinoshita R1, Nishiura H1,2.\nAuthor informationAbstract   The exported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection that were confirmed outside China provide an opportunity to estimate the cumulative incidence and confirmed case fatality risk (cCFR) in mainland China. Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand the pandemic potential of COVID-19 in the early stage of the epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number-the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a na\u00efve population. We modeled epidemic growth either from a single index case with illness onset on 8 December, 2019 (Scenario 1), or using the growth rate fitted along with the other parameters (Scenario 2) based on data from 20 exported cases reported by 24 January 2020. The cumulative incidence in China by 24 January was estimated at 6924 cases (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4885, 9211) and 19,289 cases (95% CI: 10,901, 30,158), respectively. The latest estimated values of the cCFR were 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5%, 7.5%) for Scenario 1 and 8.4% (95% CI: 5.3%, 12.3%) for Scenario 2. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.2) and 3.2 (95% CI: 2.7, 3.7) for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on these results, we argued that the current COVID-19 epidemic has a substantial potential for causing a pandemic. The proposed approach provides insights in early risk assessment using publicly available data.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  censoring; emerging infectious diseases; importation; migration; mortality; travel\n\n PMID: \t32075152 \tDOI: \t10.3390/jcm9020523",

So far, there is still no specific medicine. Previous studies have shown that chloroquine phosphate (chloroquine) had a wide range of antiviral effects, including anti-coronavirus. Here we found that treating the patients diagnosed as novel coronavirus pneumonia with chloroquine might improve the success rate of treatment, shorten hospital stay and improve patient outcome. In order to guide and regulate the use of chloroquine in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia, the multicenter collaboration group of Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province and Health Commission of Guangdong Province for chloroquine in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia developed this expert consensus after extensive discussion. It recommended chloroquine phosphate tablet, 500mg twice per day for 10 days for patients diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia and without contraindications to chloroquine.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Chloroquine; Novel coronavirus pneumonia\n\n PMID: \t32075365 \tDOI: \t10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0019",

The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 35 (56%), headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and haemoptysis in 2 (3%). Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on admission. The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2 (1-4) days.\nCONCLUSION:  As of early February 2020, compared with patients initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Zhejiang province are relatively mild.\n  Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

[Epub ahead of print]  Clinical characteristics of 140 patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China.Zhang JJ1, Dong X1, Cao YY2, Yuan YD3, Yang YB4, Yan YQ5, Akdis CA6, Gao YD1.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been widely spread. We aim to investigate the clinical characteristic and allergy status of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.\nMETHODS:  Electronical medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection were extracted and analysed.\nRESULTS:  An approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID-19 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were community acquired cases. Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common comorbidities. Drug hypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were self-reported by several patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases was not reported by any of the patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4%) and current smokers (1.4%) were rare. Bilateral ground glass or patchy opacity (89.6%) were the most common signs of radiological finding. Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients. Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r=0.486, p<0.001) and non-severe (r=0.469, p<0.001) patients after hospital admission. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to non-severe patients (all p<0.001).\nCONCLUSION:  Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 cases suggest eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis. Allergic diseases, asthma and COPD are not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Elder age, high number of comorbidities and more prominent laboratory abnormalities were associated with severe patients.\n  This article is protected by copyright.

Methods: The correlation between ALT, AST and other liver enzyme changes condition and NCP patients' disease status reported in the literature was comprehensively analyzed. ACE2 expression in liver tissue for novel coronavirus was analyzed based on single cell sequencing (GSE115469) data. RNA-Seq method was used to analyze Ace2 expression and transcription factors related to its expression in liver tissues at various time-points after hepatectomy in mouse model of acute liver injury with partial hepatectomy. t-test or Spearman rank correlation analysis was used for statistical analysis. Results: ALT and AST were abnormally elevated in some patients with novel coronavirus infection, and the rate and extent of ALT and AST elevation in severe NCP patients were higher than those in non-severe patients. Liver tissue results of single cell sequencing and immunohistochemistry showed that ACE2 was only expressed in bile duct epithelial cells of normal liver tissues, and very low in hepatocytes. In a mouse model of acute liver injury with partial hepatectomy, Ace2 expression was down-regulated on the first day, but it was elevated up to twice of the normal level on the third day, and returned to normal level on seventh day when the liver recovered and hepatocyte proliferation stopped. Whether this phenomenon suggests that the bile duct epithelial cells with positive expression of Ace2 participate in the process of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy deserves further study. In RNA-Seq data, 77 transcription factors were positively correlated with the expression of ACE2 (r > 0.2, FDR < 0.05), which were mainly enriched in the development, differentiation, morphogenesis and cell proliferation of glandular epithelial cells. Conclusion: We assumed that in addition to the over activated inflammatory response in patients with NCP, the up-regulation of ACE2 expression in liver tissue caused by compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes derived from bile duct epithelial cells may also be the possible mechanism of liver tissue injury caused by 2019 novel coronavirus infection.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV); ALT; AST; Angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2); Hepatic regeneration; Liver function; Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP); Transcription factor\n\n PMID: \t32077659 \tDOI: \t10.3760/cma.j.issn.1007-3418.2020.02.002",

Methods: Consecutively confirmed novel coronavirus infection cases admitted to seven designated hospitals during January 23, 2020 to February 8, 2020 were included. Clinical classification (mild, moderate, severe, and critical) was carried out according to the diagnosis and treatment program of novel coronavirus pneumonia (Trial Fifth Edition) issued by the National Health Commission. The research data were analyzed using SPSS19.0 statistical software. Quantitative data were expressed as median (interquartile range), and qualitative data were expressed as frequency and rate. Results: 32 confirmed cases that met the inclusion criteria were included. 28 cases were of mild or moderate type (87.50%), and four cases (12.50%) of severe or critical type. Four cases (12.5%) were combined with one underlying disease (bronchial asthma, coronary heart disease, malignant tumor, chronic kidney disease), and one case (3.13%) was simultaneously combined with high blood pressure and malignant tumor. The results of laboratory examination showed that the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (ALB), and total bilirubin (TBil) for entire cohort were 26.98 (16.88 ~ 46.09) U/L and 24.75 (18.71 ~ 31.79) U/L, 39.00 (36.20 ~ 44.20) g/L and 16.40 (11.34- ~ 21.15) mmol/L, respectively. ALT, AST, ALB and TBil of the mild or moderate subgroups were 22.75 (16.31- ~ 37.25) U/L, 23.63 (18.71 ~ 26.50) U/L, 39.70 (36.50 ~ 46.10) g/L, and 15.95 (11.34 ~ 20.83) mmol/L, respectively. ALT, AST, ALB and TBil of the severe or critical subgroups were 60.25 (40.88 ~ 68.90) U/L, 37.00 (20.88 ~ 64.45) U/L, 35.75 (28.68 ~ 42.00) g/L, and 20.50 (11.28 ~ 25.00) mmol/L, respectively. Conclusion: The results of this multicenter retrospective study suggests that novel coronavirus pneumonia combined with liver damage is more likely to be caused by adverse drug reactions and systemic inflammation in severe patients receiving medical treatment. Therefore, liver function monitoring and evaluation should be strengthened during the treatment of such patients.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Clinical typing; Hypohepatia; Liver function; NCP\n\n PMID: \t32077660 \tDOI: \t10.3760/cma.j.issn.1007-3418.2020.02.003",

A lot of respiratory treatments for critically ill patients are deemed as high-risk factors for nosocomial transmission, such as intubation, manual ventilation by resuscitator, noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula, bronchoscopy examination, suction and patient transportation, etc, due to its high possibility to cause or worsen the spread of the virus. As such, we developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Those recommendations include: (1) Standard prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2) Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3) Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4) Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5) For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6) Using sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O; (7) In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8) Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9. For patients who need breathing support during transportation, placing an HME between ventilator and patient; (10) PSV is recommended for implementing spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece to do SBT. When tracheotomy patients are weaned from ventilator, HME should be used, avoid using T-piece or tracheostomy mask. (11) Avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene therapy; (12) For patients who need aerosol therapy, dry powder inhaler metered dose inhaler with spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while vibrating mesh nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional filter is recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during nebulization.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  COVID-19; Nosocomial infection; Protective measures; Respiratory therapy; Severe and critical infections\n\n PMID: \t32077661 \tDOI: \t10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0020",

[Epub ahead of print]  Methylprednisolone may be associated with improved lung compliance in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.Tabatabai A1, Menaker J1, Stene E1, Kufera JA1, Rabinowitz RP1, Kon Z2, Herr DL1, Scalea TM1.\nAuthor informationAbstract INTRODUCTION:  Methylprednisolone has been used for acute respiratory distress syndrome with variable results. Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use in acute respiratory distress syndrome has increased. Occasionally, both are used. We hypothesized that methylprednisolone could improve lung compliance and ease weaning from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients.\nMETHODS:  We retrospectively reviewed all patients in our veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation unit treated with methylprednisolone over a 20 month period. Methylprednisolone was initiated for inability to wean off veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Dynamic compliance (Cdyn) was calculated at cannulation, methylprednisolone initiation, and decannulation. Demographics, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-specific data, and ventilator data were collected. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test for differences in dynamic compliance.\nRESULTS:  A total of 12 veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients received methylprednisolone. Mean age was 50 (\u00b115) years. Seven had influenza. Methylprednisolone was started on median Day 16 (interquartile range: 11-22) of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In total, 10 patients had veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation decannulation on median Day 12 (7-22) after methylprednisolone initiation. Two patients died before decannulation. The 10 decannulated patients had initial median dynamic compliance (mL\u2009\u00d7\u2009cm H2O-1) of 12 (7-23), then 16 (10-24) at methylprednisolone initiation, and then 44 (34-60) at decannulation. Dynamic compliance was higher at decannulation than methylprednisolone initiation (p\u2009=\u20090.002), and unchanged from cannulation to methylprednisolone initiation for all patients (p\u2009=\u20090.97). A total of 10 patients had significant infections. None had significant gastrointestinal bleed or wound healing issues.\nCONCLUSION:  Methylprednisolone may be associated with improved compliance in acute respiratory distress syndrome allowing for decannulation from veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. High rates of infection are associated with methylprednisolone use in veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Further studies are required to identify appropriate patient selection for methylprednisolone use in patients on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  acute respiratory distress syndrome; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; methylprednisolone; steroids; veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation\n\n PMID: \t32072859 \tDOI: \t10.1177/0267659120906044",

High-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV), with increased antigen content compared to standard-dose influenza vaccines (SD-IIV), is licensed for use in people aged \u226565 years. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of HD-IIV and SD-IIV for prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations.\nMETHODS:  Hospitalized patients with acute respiratory illness were enrolled in an observational vaccine effectiveness study at eight hospitals in the United States Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network during the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 influenza seasons. Enrolled patients were tested for influenza, and receipt of influenza vaccine by type was recorded. Effectiveness of SD-IIV and HD-IIV was estimated using a test-negative design (comparing odds of influenza among vaccinated and unvaccinated patients). Relative effectiveness of SD-IIV and HD-IIV was estimated using logistic regression.\nRESULTS:  Among 1487 enrolled patients aged \u226565 years, 1107 (74%) were vaccinated; 622 (56%) received HD-IIV and 485 (44%) received SD-IIV. Overall, 277 (19%) tested positive for influenza, including 98 (16%) who received HD-IIV, 87 (18%) who received SD-IIV, and 92 (24%) who were unvaccinated. After adjusting for confounding variables, effectiveness of SD-IIV was 6% (95% confidence interval [CI] -42%, 38%) and that of HD-IIV was 32% (95%CI -3%, 54%), for a relative effectiveness of HD-IIV versus SD-IIV of 27% (95%CI -1%, 48%).\nCONCLUSIONS:  During two U.S. influenza seasons, vaccine effectiveness was low to moderate for prevention of influenza hospitalization among adults aged \u226565 years. High-dose vaccine offered greater effectiveness. None of these findings were statistically significant.\n  Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America 2020.

However, an effective vaccine usually takes at least 6 months to develop for the circulating strains. Therefore, new therapeutic options are needed for the acute treatment of influenza infections to control this virus and prevent epidemics/pandemics from developing. We have discovered fast-acting, orally bioavailable acylated 4-aminopiperidines with an effective mechanism of action targeting viral hemagglutinin (HA). Our data show that these compounds are potent entry inhibitors of influenza A viruses. We present docking studies that suggest an HA binding site for these inhibitors on H5N1. Compound 16 displayed a significant decrease of viral titer when evaluated in the infectious assays with influenza virus H1N1 (A/PuertoRico/8/1934) or H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) strains and the oseltamivir-resistant strain with the most common H274Y mutation. In addition, compound 16 showed significant synergistic activity with oseltamivir in vitro.\n\n\n PMID: \t32069052 \tDOI: \t10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b01900",

Burden and seasonality of medically attended influenza like illness (ILI) in Ethiopia, 2012 to 2017.Tadesse M1, Mengesha M2, Tayachew A2, Belay D2, Hassen A2, Woyessa AB2, Zemelak E2, Beyene B2, Kassa W2, Ayele W2, Teshome B2, Mekonen M2, Assefa Z2, Moges B2.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  The influenza virus spreads rapidly around the world in seasonal epidemics, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Influenza-related incidence data are limited in many countries in Africa despite established sentinel surveillance. This study aimed to address the information gap by estimating the burden and seasonality of medically attended influenza like illness in Ethiopia.\nMETHOD:  Influenza sentinel surveillance data collected from 3 influenza like illness (ILI) and 5 Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) sites from 2012 to 2017 was used for analysis. Descriptive statistics were applied for simple analysis. The proportion of medically attended influenza positive cases and incidence rate of ILI was determined using total admitted patients and catchment area population. Seasonality was estimated based on weekly trend of ILI and predicted threshold was done by applying the \"Moving Epidemic Method (MEM)\".\nRESULT:  A total of 5715 medically attended influenza suspected patients who fulfills ILI and SARI case definition (77% ILI and 23% SARI) was enrolled. Laboratory confirmed influenza virus (influenza positive case) among ILI and SARI suspected case was 25% (1130/4426) and 3% (36/1289). Of which, 65% were influenza type A. The predominantly circulating influenza subtype were seasonal influenza A(H3N2) (n\u2009=\u2009455, 60%) and Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (n\u2009=\u2009293, 38.81%). The estimated mean annual influenza positive case proportion and ILI incidence rate was 160.04 and 52.48 per 100,000 population. The Incidence rate of ILI was higher in the age group of 15-44\u2009years of age ['Incidence rate (R) = 254.6 per 100,000 population', 95% CI; 173.65, 335.55] and 5-14\u2009years of age [R\u2009=\u200949.5, CI 95%; 31.47, 130.43]. The seasonality of influenza has two peak seasons; in a period from October-December and from April-June.\nCONCLUSION:  Significant morbidity of influenza like illness was observed with two peak seasons of the year and seasonal influenza A (H3N2) remains the predominantly circulating influenza subtype. Further study need to be considered to identify potential risks and improving the surveillance system to continue early detection and monitoring of circulating influenza virus in the country has paramount importance.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Ethiopia; ILI; Incidence rate; Influenza; SARI; Seasonality\n\n PMID: \t32070275 \tDOI: \t10.1186/s12879-020-4827-0",

Information on women's vaccination status, sociodemographic, lifestyle and psychological state were collected at 9-16 weeks' gestation and medical case notes were checked post-delivery to verify the reported vaccination status. Poisson regression models were used to estimate the crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) to identify psychosocial factors influencing uptake of vaccination during pregnancy.\nRESULTS:  Willingness to receive the recommended maternal vaccines was high (90%). Overall, 79% and 48% received maternal pertussis and influenza vaccines respectively. There was no evidence to support the influence of psychosocial factors on women's willingness to receive immunization during pregnancy. High levels of anxiety (aPR 0.98, 95% CI: 0.87-1.09) was not associated with uptake of maternal pertussis vaccine. However, elevated depressive symptoms (aPR 1.14, 95% CI: 1.00-1.30) and very high-perceived stress during pregnancy were significantly associated with receipt of pertussis vaccination (aPR 0.87; 95% CI 0.76-0.99). Women with mild depressive symptoms (aPR 1.21, 95% CI 1.00-1.44) and mild anxiety symptoms (aPR 1.21, 95% CI: 0.99-1.48) were more likely to receive influenza vaccine during pregnancy. A history of major depressive disorder was independently associated with receipt of pertussis (aPR 1.16, 95% CI 1.06-1.26) and influenza vaccination during pregnancy (aPR 1.32; 95% CI 1.14-1.58).\nCONCLUSION:  Regardless of psychosocial factors, most women reported a positive willingness to receive the recommended vaccinations during pregnancy. However, psychosocial factors influenced the uptake of pertussis and influenza vaccines during pregnancy. Psychosocial factors should be taken into consideration in designing interventions and implementation of maternal pertussis and influenza immunization programs.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020.

[Epub ahead of print]  Use of traditional serological methods and oral fluids to assess immunogenicity in children aged 2-16 years after successive annual vaccinations with LAIV.Hoschler K1, Maharjan S2, Whitaker H3, Southern J4, Okai B2, Baldevarona J2, Turner PJ5, Andrews NJ3, Miller E4, Zambon M2.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  The UK introduced quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (qLAIV) for children in 2013/2014. The impact of annual vaccination on effectiveness and immunogenicity is being assessed.\nMETHOD:  A phase III/IV open-label study of the immunogenicity of annual vaccination with qLAIV (Fluenz\u2122) was conducted over three consecutive years (2014/15-2016/17) in 254, 249 and 162 children respectively. Serum responses to vaccine components were measured by Haemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) and anti-A(H1N1)pdm09 Neuraminidase (NAI) assays, stratified according to previous receipt of AS03B-adjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic vaccine in 2009/10. Antibody levels to the A(H1N1)pdm09 and H3N2 vaccine components in oral fluids (OF) were explored using an ELISA.\nFINDINGS:  More paired pre- and post-vaccination oral fluids (96%) than paired sera (87%) were obtained. Geometric mean titre rises using HAI assays were limited, with maximum rises seen in year one for both influenza B strains when 39% and 43% of subjects seroconverted (95% confidence interval 33-46% and 36-50%, respectively) and year two for influenza H3N2, when 40% (33-46%) individuals seroconverted. Prior pandemic vaccine receipt resulted in higher pre- and post-vaccination A(H1N1)pdm09 HAI titres and lower pre-and post-vaccination NAI (N1 neuraminidase) titres in all three years. OF results were congruent with HAI results; assay specificity compared to HAI was 88.1 and 71.6 percent, and sensitivity was 86.4 and 74.8 percent respectively for A(H1N1)pdm09 and H3N2.\nCONCLUSION:  In all three study years, vaccination with qLAIV resulted in poor antibody responses. However, OFs are an alternative specimen type that allows self sampling, can easily be obtained from children, and their analysis leads to similar conclusions as classic serology by HAI. Their suitability for seroprevalence studies should be investigated. We demonstrated a sustained effect from prior receipt of the AS03B-adjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine, even after repeat vaccination with qLAIV indicating that early exposure to influenza antigens has a significant long lasting effect.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020.

Records for at-risk English adults between 2011 and 2016 were identified using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink database. SIV uptake was assessed annually. The associations of patient, practice, and seasonal characteristics with SIV uptake were assessed via cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, using mixed-effects and general estimating equation logistic regression models. Overall SIV uptake was 35.3% and 74.0% for adults 18-64 and 65+, respectively. Relative to white patients, black patients were least likely to be vaccinated (OR18-64: 0.82 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.85); OR65+: 0.59 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.62)), while Asian patients among 18-64 year olds were most likely to be vaccinated (OR18-64: 1.10 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.13)). Females were more likely than males to be vaccinated among 18-64 year olds (OR18-64: 1.19 (95% CI: 1.18, 1.20)). Greater socioeconomic deprivation was associated with decreased odds of uptake among older patients (OR65+: 0.74 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.77)). For each additional at-risk condition, odds of uptake increased (OR18-64: 2.33 (95% CI: 2.31, 2.36); OR65+: 1.39 (95% CI: 1.38, 1.39)). Odds of uptake were highest among younger patients with diabetes (OR18-64: 4.25 (95% CI: 4.18, 4.32)) and older patients with chronic respiratory disease (OR65+: 1.60 (95% CI: 1.58, 1.63)), whereas they were lowest among morbidly obese patients of all ages (OR18-64: 0.68 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.70); OR65+: 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94, 0.99)). Prior influenza season severity and vaccine effectiveness were marginally predictive of uptake. Our age-stratified analysis uncovered SIV uptake disparities by ethnicity, sex, age, socioeconomic deprivation, and co-morbidities, warranting further attention by GPs and policymakers alike.\n  \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  CPRD, Clinical Practice Research Datalink; Clinical Practice Research Datalink; Determinants; GP, general practitioner; General practice; IMD, Index of Multiple Deprivations; NHS, National Health Service; PHE, Public Health England; SES, socioeconomic status; SIV, season influenza vaccine; Seasonal influenza vaccine; UK, United Kingdom; VE, vaccine effectiveness; Vaccine uptake; WHO, World Health Organization\n\n PMID: \t32072152 \tPMCID: \tPMC7011080 \tDOI: \t10.1016/j.jvacx.2020.100054 \nFree PMC Article",

A System Based-Approach to Examine Host Response during Infection with Influenza A Virus Subtype H7N9 in Human and Avian Cells.Taye B1,2,3, Chen H1,4, Yeo DS5, Seah SG5, Wong MS5, Sugrue RJ1, Tan BH1,5,6.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Although the influenza A virus H7N9 subtype circulates within several avian species, it can also infect humans with a severe disease outcome. To better understand the biology of the H7N9 virus we examined the host response to infection in avian and human cells. In this study we used the A/Anhui/1/2013 strain, which was isolated during the first wave of the H7N9 epidemic. The H7N9 virus-infected both human (Airway Epithelial cells) and avian (Chick Embryo Fibroblast) cells, and each infected host transcriptome was examined with bioinformatic tools and compared with other representative avian and human influenza A virus subtypes. The H7N9 virus induced higher expression changes (differentially regulated genes) in both cell lines, with more prominent changes observed in avian cells. Ortholog mapping of differentially expression genes identified significant enriched common and cell-type pathways during H7N9 infections. This data confirmed our previous findings that different influenza A virus subtypes have virus-specific replication characteristics and anti-virus signaling in human and avian cells. In addition, we reported for the first time, the new HIPPO signaling pathway in avian cells, which we hypothesized to play a vital role to maintain the antiviral state of H7N9 virus-infected avian cells. This could explain the absence of disease symptoms in avian species that tested positive for the presence of H7N9 virus.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  A549 cells; CEF cells; H7N9; HIPPO signaling pathway; Influenza A virus; differentially expression genes (DEGs)\n\n PMID: \t32075271 \tDOI: \t10.3390/cells9020448",

Emergence of human avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infections in Wenshan City in Southwest China, 2017.Jiang L1, Zhao X2, Xu W2, Zhou X3, Luo C2, Zhou J2, Fu X2, Chen Y2, Li D4.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  The emergence of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus was reported in Wenshan City, southwestern China in 2017. The study describes the epidemiological and virological features of the outbreak and discusses the origin of the infection.\nMETHODS:  Poultry exposure and timelines of key events for each patient were collected. Samples derived from the patients, their close contacts, and environments were tested for influenza A(H7N9) virus by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Genetic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were also conducted.\nRESULTS:  Five patients were reported in the outbreak. An epidemiological investigation showed that all patients had been exposed at live poultry markets. The A(H7N9) isolates from these patients had low pathogenicity in avian species. Both epidemiological investigations of chicken sources and phylogenetic analysis of viral gene sequences indicated that the source of infection was from Guangxi Province, which lies 100\u2009km to the east of Wenshan City.\nCONCLUSIONS:  In the study, a sudden emergence of human cases of H7N9 was documented in urban area of Wenshan City. Chickens were an important carrier in the H7N9 virus spreading from Guangxi to Wenshan. Hygienic management of live poultry markets and virological screening of chickens transported across regions should be reinforced to limit the spread of H7N9 virus.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Emerge; Human infection; Influenza a(H7N9) virus; Wenshan\n\n PMID: \t32075579 \tDOI: \t10.1186/s12879-020-4858-6",

[Epub ahead of print]  Suppression of Cytotoxic T Cell Functions and Decreased Levels of Tissue Resident Memory T cell During H5N1 infection.Kandasamy M1, Furlong K1, Perez JT1, Manicassamy S2, Manicassamy B3.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Seasonal influenza virus infections cause mild illness in healthy adults, as timely viral clearance is mediated by the functions of cytotoxic T cells. However, avian H5N1 influenza virus infections can result in prolonged and fatal illness across all age groups, which has been attributed to the overt and uncontrolled activation of host immune responses. Here we investigate how excessive innate immune responses to H5N1 impair subsequent adaptive T cell responses in the lungs. Using recombinant H1N1 and H5N1 strains sharing 6 internal genes, we demonstrate that H5N1 (2:6) infection in mice causes higher stimulation and increased migration of lung dendritic cells to the draining lymph nodes, resulting in higher numbers of virus specific T cells in the lungs. Despite robust T cell responses in the lungs, H5N1 (2:6) infected mice showed inefficient and delayed viral clearance as compared to H1N1 infected mice. In addition, we observed higher levels of inhibitory signals including increased PD1 and IL-10 expression by cytotoxic T cells in H5N1 (2:6) infected mice, suggesting that delayed viral clearance of H5N1 (2:6) was due to suppression of T cell functions in vivo Importantly, H5N1 (2:6) infected mice displayed decreased numbers of tissue resident memory T cells as compared to H1N1 infected mice; however, despite decreased number of tissue resident memory T cells, H5N1 (2:6) were protected against a heterologous challenge from H3N2 virus (X31). Taken together, our study provides mechanistic insight for the prolonged viral replication and protracted illness observed in H5N1 infected patients.ImportanceInfluenza viruses cause upper respiratory tract infections in humans. In healthy adults, seasonal influenza virus infections result in mild disease. Occasionally, influenza viruses endemic in domestic birds can cause severe and fatal disease even in healthy individuals. In avian influenza virus infected patients, the host immune system is activated in an uncontrolled manner and is unable to control infection in a timely fashion. In this study, we investigated why the immune system fails to effectively control a modified form of avian influenza virus. Our studies show that T cell functions important for clearing virally infected cells are impaired by higher negative regulatory signals during modified avian influenza virus infection. In addition, memory T cell numbers were decreased in modified avian influenza virus infected mice. Our studies provide a possible mechanism for the severe and prolonged disease associated with avian influenza virus infections in humans.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Kandasamy et al.\n\n\n PMID: \t32075925 \tDOI: \t10.1128/JVI.00057-20 \n  Free full text",

A survey of a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults (N = 2,091) explored the factors associated with intentions to seek influenza vaccine information in the 2018-2019 influenza season. This survey shed light on what motivates intentions to seek information about the influenza vaccine through the lens of the risk information seeking and processing (RISP) model. The model explained information-seeking intentions well among both unvaccinated and vaccinated respondents. Key findings show that informational subjective norms, information insufficiency, and different types of affect are strong predictors of information-seeking intentions.

We explored knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, intentions, and trust regarding maternal and infant vaccines among pregnant women. Between June 2017 and July 2018, we surveyed 2196 pregnant women recruited from geographically and socio-demographically diverse prenatal care practices in Georgia and Colorado (56% response rate). Fifty-six percent of pregnant women intended to receive both influenza and Tdap vaccines during pregnancy and 68% intended to vaccinate their baby with all recommended vaccines on time. Attitudinal constructs associated with intention to vaccinate include confidence in vaccine safety (ORs: 16-38) and efficacy (ORs: 4-19), perceived risk of vaccine-preventable diseases (ORs: 2-6), social norms (ORs: 4-10), and trust in sources of vaccine information. Women pregnant with their first child were less likely than women who had prior children to intend to vaccinate themselves and their children, more likely to be unsure about their intentions to receive both maternal and infant vaccines, and less likely to report feeling they had enough knowledge or information about vaccines and vaccine safety (p < .01). This demonstrates an opportunity for vaccine education to increase vaccine confidence and informed decision-making, especially among first-time pregnant women.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  maternal and child health; pregnancy; \ufeffapp; \ufeffcocooning; \ufeffeducation; \ufeffreferral; \ufeffsocial \ufeffnetwork; \ufeffvaccines\n\n PMID: \t32078395 \tDOI: \t10.1080/21645515.2020.1717130",

[Epub ahead of print]  Retrospective study of the use of an influenza disease two-tiered classification system to characterize clinical severity in US children.Hsiao A1, Buck PO2, Yee A1, Hansen J1, Lewis EM1, Aukes LL1, Yanni E2, Bekkat-Berkani R3, Schuind A3, Klein NP1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   In children <5 years, influenza is associated with higher risk of serious disease and hospitalization when compared with other age groups. Influenza vaccination reduces the risk of influenza and vaccination may attenuate the severity of disease. Recent studies in Europe suggest that classifying influenza disease as mild versus moderate-to-severe (M-S) using a novel definition may be clinically significant. We retrospectively evaluated whether this M-S definition also characterized influenza severity in a cohort of US children. We included children <18 years at Kaiser Permanente Northern California with PCR-confirmed influenza during the 2013-2014 influenza season. We classified children as M-S if they had \u22651 symptom: fever >39\u00b0C, acute otitis media, lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), or extra-pulmonary complications; otherwise, they were classified as mild. We used multivariable log-binomial models to assess whether M-S influenza disease was associated with increased healthcare utilization. Nearly half of the 1,105 influenza positive children were classified as M-S. Children 6-35 months had the highest proportion of M-S disease (35.1%), mostly due to LRTI (63.2%) and fever (44.6%). Children \u22656 months who had M-S disease were associated with a 1.6 to 2.8 times increased likelihood of having had an emergency department or any follow-up outpatient visits. Those who had M-S disease were associated with an increased likelihood of receiving antibiotics, with the highest likelihood in children 6-35 months (RR 9.0, 95% CI 4.1, 19.8). While more studies are needed, an influenza classification system may distinguish children with more clinically significant disease.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Influenza; disease severity; health outcomes; pediatric\n\n PMID: \t32078443 \tDOI: \t10.1080/21645515.2019.1706412",

At present, the impact of age upon this process is relatively unexplored. Here, we evaluated the Ab response in newborn and adult African green monkeys (AGM) following infection with IAV using a strain that enables us to determine the immunodominance (ID) hierarchy of the Ab response to hemagglutinin (HA), the principal target of protective Abs. This revealed altered ID patterns in the early IgM anti-HA response in newborns versus adults that converged over time. While the IgG ID profiles for HA in newborn and adult monkeys were similar, this was not the case for IgA. Importantly, HA stem-specific Abs were generated robustly and similarly in newborns and adults in terms of quality and quantity. Together these results demonstrate that newborns and adults can differ in the Ab ID pattern established following infection and that the ID pattern can vary across isotypes. In addition, newborns have the ability to generate potent HA stem-specific Ab responses. Our findings further the understanding of the newborn response to IAV antigens and inform the development of improved vaccines for this at-risk population.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  B cells; Immunology\n\n PMID: \t32078584 \tDOI: \t10.1172/jci.insight.135449",

Interim Estimates of 2019-20 Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness - United States, February 2020.Dawood FS, Chung JR, Kim SS, Zimmerman RK, Nowalk MP, Jackson ML, Jackson LA, Monto AS, Martin ET, Belongia EA, McLean HQ, Gaglani M, Dunnigan K, Foust A, Sessions W, DaSilva J, Le S, Stark T, Kondor RJ, Barnes JR, Wentworth DE, Brammer L, Fry AM, Patel MM, Flannery B.\nAbstract   During the 2019-20 influenza season, influenza-like illness (ILI)* activity first exceeded the national baseline during the week ending November 9, 2019, signaling the earliest start to the influenza season since the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. Activity remains elevated as of mid-February 2020. In the United States, annual vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended for all persons aged \u22656 months (1). During each influenza season, CDC estimates seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza associated with medically attended acute respiratory illness (ARI). This interim report used data from 4,112 children and adults enrolled in the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (U.S. Flu VE Network) during October 23, 2019-January 25, 2020. Overall, vaccine effectiveness (VE) against any influenza virus associated with medically attended ARI was 45% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 36%-53%). VE was estimated to be 50% (95% CI = 39%-59%) against influenza B/Victoria viruses and 37% (95% CI = 19%-52%) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, indicating that vaccine has significantly reduced medical visits associated with influenza so far this season. Notably, vaccination provided substantial protection (VE = 55%; 95% CI = 42%-65%) among children and adolescents aged 6 months-17 years. Interim VE estimates are consistent with those from previous seasons, ranging from 40%-60% when influenza vaccines were antigenically matched to circulating viruses. CDC recommends that health care providers continue to administer influenza vaccine to persons aged \u22656 months because influenza activity is ongoing, and the vaccine can still prevent illness, hospitalization, and death associated with currently circulating influenza viruses as well as other influenza viruses that might circulate later in the season.\n\n\n PMID: \t32078591 \tDOI: \t10.15585/mmwr.mm6907a1 \n   [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Comparison of sequencing methods and data processing pipelines for whole genome sequencing and minority single nucleotide variant (mSNV) analysis during an influenza A/H5N8 outbreak.Poen MJ1, Pohlmann A2, Amid C3, Bestebroer TM1, Brookes SM4, Brown IH4, Everett H4, Schapendonk CME1, Scheuer RD1, Smits SL1, Beer M2, Fouchier RAM1, Ellis RJ4.\nAuthor informationAbstract   As high-throughput sequencing technologies are becoming more widely adopted for analysing pathogens in disease outbreaks there needs to be assurance that the different sequencing technologies and approaches to data analysis will yield reliable and comparable results. Conversely, understanding where agreement cannot be achieved provides insight into the limitations of these approaches and also allows efforts to be focused on areas of the process that need improvement. This manuscript describes the next-generation sequencing of three closely related viruses, each analysed using different sequencing strategies, sequencing instruments and data processing pipelines. In order to determine the comparability of consensus sequences and minority (sub-consensus) single nucleotide variant (mSNV) identification, the biological samples, the sequence data from 3 sequencing platforms and the *.bam quality-trimmed alignment files of raw data of 3 influenza A/H5N8 viruses were shared. This analysis demonstrated that variation in the final result could be attributed to all stages in the process, but the most critical were the well-known homopolymer errors introduced by 454 sequencing, and the alignment processes in the different data processing pipelines which affected the consistency of mSNV detection. However, homopolymer errors aside, there was generally a good agreement between consensus sequences that were obtained for all combinations of sequencing platforms and data processing pipelines. Nevertheless, minority variant analysis will need a different level of careful standardization and awareness about the possible limitations, as shown in this study.\n\n\n PMID: \t32078666 \tDOI: \t10.1371/journal.pone.0229326",

There was no report of COVID-19 at this hospital. After development of disease in her relatives, patient 1 was isolated and observed. As of February 11, she had no elevated temperature measured or self-reported fever and no gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms, including cough and sore throat, reported or observed by the physicians. Chest CT images on January 27 and 31 showed no significant abnormalities. Her C-reactive protein level and lymphocyte count were normal (Table). Results of RT-PCR testing were negative on January 26, positive on January 28, and negative on February 5 and 8.\n   Patients 2 through 6 developed COVID-19. Four were women, and ages ranged from 42 to 57 years. None of the patients had visited Wuhan or been in contact with any other people who had traveled to Wuhan (except patient 1).\n   Patients 2 through 5 developed fever and respiratory symptoms between January 23 and January 26 and were admitted to the hospital on the same day. All patients had RT-PCR test results positive for COVID-19 within 1 day. Patient 6 developed fever and sore throat on January 17 and went to the local clinic for treatment. There was no report of COVID-19 at the clinic. Her symptoms improved over the next few days but worsened on January 24, when she was admitted to the hospital and confirmed to have COVID-19 on January 26. Two patients developed severe pneumonia; the other infections were moderate.\n   All symptomatic patients had multifocal ground-glass opacities on chest CT, and 1 also had subsegmental areas of consolidation and fibrosis. All the symptomatic patients had increased C-reactive protein levels and reduced lymphocyte counts (Table).\n    Discussion\n\n   A familial cluster of 5 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Anyang, China, had contact before their symptom onset with an asymptomatic family member who had traveled from the epidemic center of Wuhan. The sequence of events suggests that the coronavirus may have been transmitted by the asymptomatic carrier. The incubation period for patient 1 was 19 days, which is long but within the reported range of 0 to 24 days.4 Her first RT-PCR result was negative; false-negative results have been observed related to the quality of the kit, the collected sample, or performance of the test. RT-PCR has been widely deployed in diagnostic virology and has yielded few false-positive outcomes.5 Thus, her second RT-PCR result was unlikely to have been a false-positive and was used to define infection with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n   One previous study reported an asymptomatic 10-year-old boy with COVID-19 infection, but he had abnormalities on chest CT.6 If the findings in this report of presumed transmission by an asymptomatic carrier are replicated, the prevention of COVID-19 infection would prove challenging. The mechanism by which asymptomatic carriers could acquire and transmit the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 requires further study.\n\n\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jam...rticle/2762028",

All passengers will be subjected to a 14-day quarantine upon their return to the United States.\n  Media reports yesterday suggested the CDC did not approve of the movement of the sick passengers to the United States, but the transport was ordered by the State Department. In the Washington Post, reporters quoted sources saying the decision to fly the sick passengers was a nightmare scenario.\n  Messonnier said the CDC will now track US cases of the novel coronavirus in two subsets to help quickly determine if community spread is taking place. Patients will be grouped into either a \"repatriated\" category or a separate category that represents cases related to individual travel or close case contact.\n  \"We are keeping track of cases from repatriation because we do not believe those numbers accurately represent the picture of what is happening in the community,\" Messonnier said.\nCalifornia reports new case  As of today, the CDC said there have been 21 COVID-19 cases in repatriated Americans, including 18 in Diamond Princess passengers, and another 13 US cases related to travel or case contact, for a total of 31.\n  Yesterday the University of Nebraska Medical Center confirmed that 11 of 13 Diamond Princess passengers tested positive for the coronavirus. Also yesterday, Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane also confirmed four Americans aboard the cruise ship who had the virus would be treated at that facility.\n  Messonnier also said some Americans who were aboard the Diamond Princess are currently hospitalized in Japan, including some who are in serious condition. So far two Japanese passengers from the cruise ship who had COVID-19 died.\n  The latest US case not linked to the Diamond Princess was confirmed in Humboldt County, California, yesterday and involves a patient who had recently traveled to mainland China. This marks the seventh case in California. There have also been single confirmed cases in Massachusetts, Washington state, Arizona, and Wisconsin. Illinois has reported two cases.\n  A close contact of the Humboldt County patient also has symptoms, county officials said.

He also announced six special WHO envoys who will provide advice to countries in different parts of the world.\n  He also said the WHO is aware of China's change in case reporting, which reverts to only including lab-positive cases among the confirmed cases. Tedros added that the change provides better clarity, since some of the clinically confirmed cases may not reflect COVID-19 infections. He said China's switch back to the original reporting system might be a sign of improved lab-testing capacity.\nCanada, Lebanon note Iran-linked cases  Over the past few days, Iran reported five COVID-19 cases, two of them fatal, and last night health officials in British Columbia announced presumed positive test findings in a woman in her 30s who recently returned from Iran. Authorities from BC's Fraser health region are tracing the contacts of the woman, who is in isolation at her home. The illness brings Canada's total to 9, of which 6 are from BC.\n  In a similar development, Lebanon's health minister announced at a news conference today that the country had detected its first COVID-19 case, a 45-year-old woman who had arrived from Iran, Reuters reported. Authorities are following up on two other suspected cases.\n  At a WHO telebriefing today, Jaouad Mahjour, MD, MPH, said the illness was detected among symptomatic cases during airport surveillance. He added that the WHO stands ready to provide technical assistance.\n  Today, Iran's health ministry reported 13 more cases and 2 more deaths. Most are from Qom, where the country's first cases, both fatal, were detected. Officials said 7 are from Qom, 4 are from Tehran, and 2 are from Guilan. It said two of the newly reported patients died from the disease and that two more suspected cases are under investigation in Babylon, involving people who have a history of travel to Qom. Iran now has 18 cases, 4 of them fatal.\n  Elsewhere in the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates reported 2 new cases involving people who had close contact with an infected person from China, raising its total to 11, the ministry said on Twitter today.\nSouth Korea, Japan reports more steep rises  South Korea today reported 100 more cases, raising its total to 204. Of the most recent cases, 85 are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus cluster, according to Kyodo News, which cited the country's health ministry. It added that 400 of the sect's 3,500 members have shown symptoms of the disease.\n  Meanwhile, Japan has reported 21 more cases since yesterday, raising its total to 105. In a pair of health ministry summaries, one covering 9 cases and the other covering 12 cases, officials said the patients are from nine different locations: Hokkaido, Nagoya, Tokyo, Chiba, Fukuoka, Sagamihara, Isikawa, Saitama prefecture, and Okinawa.\n  In Singapore, the health ministry reported one more case today, a contact of an earlier confirmed case. The country now has 86 cases, and so far, all but 8 are linked to known cases.\nItaly confirms first locally transmitted cases  In two separate reports today, Italy reported 16 cases, 14 in Lombardy region and 2 in neighboring Veneto region, Reuters reported. The ministry first reported 6 cases in Lombardy, which it said marked the first local transmission, then followed up with a report of 8 more.\n  A separate news agency report said two illnesses were reported, but it's not clear if they're linked to the cases in Lombardy. Italy now has 19 cases.\n  The WHO said in its latest situation report that over the past 24 hours it received reports of 127 new cases, raising the total outside of China to 1,200 , including 8 deaths, from 28 countries. Of those, 634 are related to Japan's Diamond Princess cruise ship cluster.\nNew estimates suggest multiple undetected transmission chains  Modeling experts from Imperial College London examined recent COVID-19 developments outside of China that suggest that two-thirds of cases exported from China's mainland have gone undetected, which could have triggered yet-undetected local spread of the virus.\n  For their analysis, they estimated the likely size of the epidemic in Wuhan based on air traffic volume and the number of cases outside of China. Then they examined country rates of confirmed cases related to flight volume to gauge the sensitivity of different surveillance systems.\n  Though travel restrictions from Wuhan and other parts of China may have reduced the number of travelers to and from China, their estimates still suggest that a significant number of exported cases (63% to 73%) have gone undetected.\n  They said that differences in illness severity make some cases tough to detect. \"However, some countries have detected significantly fewer than would have been expected based on the volume of flight passengers arriving from Wuhan City, China,\" they wrote.\n  The report is Imperial College London's sixth to address issues related to the COVID-19 epidemic.\nChina reports prison clusters, another doctor death  China's National Health Commission today reported 889 more cases, raising the country's overall total to 75,465. It also reported 118 more deaths and 231 fewer serious cases, raising those respective totals to 2,236 and 11,633, respectively.\n  Shandong province, located on China's northeastern coast, has reported a spurt of 202 new cases over the past day, and at today's WHO media briefing, Tedros said health officials are seeking more information about the rise.\n  In other developments in China:Illness clusters have been reported at several prisons, three in Hubei province, one in Shandong province, and one in Zhejiang province, the South China Morning Post reported today. There were 200 confirmed cases at the Shandong province prison, but it's not clear if that total explains the province's recent spike in cases.\nAnother death has been reported, in a doctor working at a Wuhan hospital, Xinhua, China's state news agency, reported today. Peng Yinhua, MD, age 29, a respiratory care specialist, was hospitalized on Jan 25 and died last night.",

The results showed that the association between risk of any birth defect, specifically heart defects, and macrolide use during the first trimester was significantly higher than it was for penicillin use.\n  Although the findings are observational and do not establish that macrolide antibiotics cause birth defects, they add to growing concerns about use of the drugs during pregnancy. Macrolides are widely used to treat infections in pregnant women with suspected penicillin allergies, but research has shown associations between macrolides and increased risk of heart arrhythmia and cardiovascular mortality, as well as miscarriage in pregnant women.\n  The authors of the study say the link indicates that alternative antibiotics should be considered for pregnant women.\n  \"Our findings suggest it would be better to avoid macrolides during pregnancy if alternative antibiotics can be used,\" study co-author Ruth Gilbert, MD, PhD, a professor of clinical epidemiology at University College London's (UCL's) Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, said in a university press release.\nIncreased risk of any malformation  For the study, UCL researchers used data from the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink to analyze 104,605 children whose mothers received a prescription for a macrolide (erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin) or a penicillin at any time during their pregnancy. Children were followed from birth to 14 years, with a median follow-up of 5.8 years.\n  Two other groups of children\u201482,314 whose mothers had received a macrolide or penicillin before pregnancy, and 53,735 siblings of children in the study cohort\u2014served as negative controls for the analysis.\n  The main outcomes the researchers were looking for were major malformations such as heart, genital, and gastrointestinal defects, and neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Because of the association between macrolide use and cardiovascular issues, they hypothesized that macrolides might induce fetal cardiac arrhythmia and short-term fetal hypoxia, which can have long-term effects.\n  Of the children in the study cohort, 8,632 (8.3%) were born to women prescribed a macrolide during pregnancy, and major malformations were recorded in 186 (21.55 per 1,000 live births). Of the 95,973 (91.7%) children born to women who were prescribed a penicillin, a major malformation was recorded in 1,666 (17.36 per 1,000 live births).\n  After accounting for other factors, including maternal age, drug and alcohol use, and chronic medical treatments, the analysis found that macrolide use in the first trimester was associated with increased risk of any malformation compared with penicillin use (27.65 vs 17.65 per 1,000 live births; adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19 to 2.03), specifically cardiovascular malformations (10.60 vs 6.61 per 1,000 live births; aRR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.51).\n  \"Assuming the associations are causal, we estimate that for every 1,000 mothers prescribed macrolides instead of penicillins during the first trimester, an additional 4.1 (95% confidence interval 0.4 to 9.4) children would have cardiovascular malformations; the corresponding figures for prescriptions during any trimester and genital malformations would be 1.7 (0.4 to 3.5),\" the authors of the study write.\n  Macrolide prescribing in any trimester was associated with a 58% increased risk of genital malformations (4.75 vs 3.07 per 1,000 live births; aRR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.59). In addition, analysis of specific types of macrolides found that erythromycin in the first trimester was associated with an increased risk of any major malformation compared with penicillin (27.39 vs 17.65 per 1,000 live births; aRR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.99).\n  The analysis found no significant associations between macrolides and any other specific malformations or neurodevelopmental disorders. And no significant associations between macrolides and adverse outcomes were found in the control groups.\nAntibiotic use during pregnancy common  Use of antibiotics is common in pregnant women, with some estimates indicating as many as one in four women will be prescribed an antibiotic during pregnancy. Although the science on how pregnancy affects the immune system remains unsettled, some expecting mothers are more prone to infections, and pregnancy can make some infections more severe.\n  The authors say that, given the widespread use of macrolides during pregnancy, international collaboration is urgently needed to further explore the issue.",

But most regions are still experiencing elevated influenza activity, and 13 more pediatric deaths were recorded, raising the 2019-20 flu season total to 105.\n  Some flu markers, including rates of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) dropped last week, to 6.1%, compared with the previous week's 6.7%. The percentage of specimens positively identified as influenza also dropped slightly, from 30.8% to 29.6%.\n  The number of jurisdictions reporting high ILI activity remained the same as noted last week, 46. The number of jurisdictions reporting regional or widespread flu dropped from 51 to 48.\n  \"Key indicators that track flu activity remain high but decreased slightly this week. Indicators that track overall severity (hospitalizations and deaths) are not high at this point in the season,\" the CDC said. The cumulative hospitalization rate was 47.4 per 100,000 population, similar to what has been seen in other flu seasons, even though it was up from 41.9 per 100,000 the week before.\n  As has been the trend in recent weeks, detections of influenza A outpaced influenza B, with public health labs confirming that 64.9% of positive specimens were influenza A and 35.1% were influenza B. Of the subtyped influenza A specimens, 96.0% were 2009 H1N1, and 4.0% were H3N2. Influenza B/Victoria accounted for 98.4% of B viruses detected.\n  Yesterday the CDC released interim estimates of 2019-20 flu vaccine effectiveness, which showed protection was 45% overall and 55% in children.\nFeb 21 CDC FluView\nFeb 20 CIDRAP News story \"At midseason, flu vaccine yields 45% protection in US, 58% in Canada\"\n\nPakistan reports 5 new wild poliovirus cases; other cases noted in Africa  According to the latest update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) today, Pakistan recorded five new wild poliovirus cases, and three African countries\u2014Angola, Ethiopia, and Ghana\u2014tracked vaccine-derived cases.\n  Four of the Pakistani cases were in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and one was seen in Balochistan province.

Meanwhile, China reported 394 new cases of the new coronavirus illness, a sharp drop that follows a case definition change that includes only lab-tested positives among the confirmed cases.\nDoctor infected in Iran  Following a report yesterday of its first two cases, both fatal, Iran's health ministry today reported three more. Two are in Qom, the same city where the first two cases were confirmed, and one is in Arak, located about 92 miles southwest of that city.\n  All three patients are Iranian citizens, and the ministry's machine-translated statement said the patient in Arak is a doctor. It said health officials have proposed limiting visits to Qom's holy shrine and other pilgrimage sites. Among other measures, the health ministry has also advised canceling seminars and conferences in Qom.\n  A health official was quoted in Iran's state news agency as saying the patients whose illnesses and deaths were announced yesterday had not had any contact with foreigners or people who had traveled to  China, Al Jazeera reported today. It added that an advisor to Iran's health ministry said testing is under way on suspected cases in several other cities, and that the state news agency reported that two people with suspected infections have been quarantined in Babol, located in northern Iran.\nMany Korea cases part of church cluster  Since yesterday, South Korea has reported 53 more cases, raising its total to 104, and the country also reported its first death from the virus, according to the latest reports from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. South Korea now has the most cases outside China, excluding the Diamond Princess cluster.\n  Of the 22 most recent cases, 21 were in Daegu and Gyeongbuk, and 1 was in Seoul. Five appear to be part of a church cluster, 1 is from New Oriental Hospital in Seoul, and 13, including the death, are linked to Qingdao Daenam Hospital.\n  A BBC report said 30 of the 53 new cases are linked to the church, described as a sect, in Daegu, South Korea's fourth-largest city, with a population of about 2.5 million. It also noted that the COVID-19 death occurred in a 63-year-old man who was hospitalized in Cheongdo, where 15 people at the facility had tested positive for the virus.\n  Daegu is also home to a US Army garrison, which has restricted access and closed schools and nonessential businesses for a second day, Stars and Stripes reported today. It said US service members will be allowed to wear face masks while in uniform. So far, no cases have been detected in US personnel.\n  At a World Health Organization (WHO) media telebriefing today, Oliver Morgan, PhD, who directs the WHO's health emergency information and risk assessment department, said the rising numbers in South Korea mainly involve several clusters linked to known cases.\n  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, the WHO's director-general, said that, with the measures South Korea is taking, the disease spread is manageable.\nUS officials clashed over cruise ship passenger flight  Japan's health ministry today reported two deaths in passengers who had been on the Diamond Princess, both of whom were in their 80s and were hospitalized on shore. Both were Japanese, one a man with underlying health conditions from Kanagawa and the other a woman from Tokyo.\n  In another development related to the ship, the health ministry said today that two government officials have been infected following their work on the ship, one from the health ministry and another from the cabinet secretary.\n  In other cruise ship developments, the Washington Post, citing unnamed people involved in the discussions, reported today that US government officials on Feb 16 wrestled with whether to allow 14 infected Americans to fly home on a chartered jet with a group of 300 American evacuees. It said officials received word that test results were positive for 14 people shortly before the plane was to leave Japan.\n  Officials from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) opposed mixing the infected and uninfected people, because of the increased transmission risk, and the State Department had announced earlier that infected people would not be allowed to board the planes.\n  But the State Department and a Trump Administration official ended up overruling the CDC's advice. The infected travelers didn't have symptoms, and the plane had a plastic-lined enclosure to separate the passengers. According to the report, the CDC insisted that the agency not be mentioned in the news release lest people think that the infected people flew with the others based on CDC advice.\n  Japan's health ministry also reported 10 more cases in seven different locations, raising its overall total\u2014not including the cruise ship\u2014to 84, according to a summary from the country's health ministry. The locations include Sagamihara, Kanagawa Prefecture, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Okinawa prefecture, Tokyo, and Nagoya.\n  The US CDC yesterday issued a travel watch for Japan owing to multiple instances of community spread reported in the country. A travel watch, the CDC's lowest travel advisory level, urges visitors to practice usual precautions, such as avoiding sick people and washing hands frequently.\nChina cases appear to slow  China's National Health Commission today reported 394 new cases, down sharply from the 1,739 reported yesterday, which follows the country's announcement yesterday that it will no longer include clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases with the lab-confirmed numbers. The overall total is now 74,576.\n  The country also reported 114 more deaths and 113 fewer serious illnesses, putting those respective totals at 2,118 and 11,864.\n  In other developments inside China, government officials in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, announced that work suspension has been extended to Mar 11, Reuters reported. Schools will also remain shuttered, and the only firms allowed to resume work are those involved in outbreak control and public services.\nSingapore reports 1 new case  Singapore's health ministry today reported 1 more case, raising the country's total to 85. It said contact tracing is under way to identify any links to earlier cases or travel to China. The country has linked all but 9 cases to clusters or earlier cases.\n  In its daily situation report today, the WHO said that over the past 24 hours it has received reports of 149 new cases outside of China, raising the total to 1,073, 8 of them fatal, from 26 countries. Of those, 621 are from the Diamond Princess.",

Any patient who took antiviral medications was not included in the study.\n  Among the 4,112 ARI patients enrolled in the study from Oct 23, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020, a total of 1,060 (26%) tested positive for influenza virus infection, including 691 (17% of the total patients) for influenza B viruses and 374 (9%) for influenza A viruses. A total of 37% of flu-positive patients had received the 2019-20 seasonal influenza vaccine, compared with 55% who were unvaccinated.\n  Overall, the adjusted VE was 45% against influenza A and B viruses combined, 50% against influenza B/Victoria, and 37% against A/H1N1, the authors said. Flu VE for adults ages 18 to 49 against H1N1 was especially low (5%; 95% confidence interval, \u2212 45% to 37%), and younger adults and children seemed to get more protection from the vaccine against all circulating flu strains.\n  \"Interim VE estimates against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses among children and older adults are consistent with average VE for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses reported previously,\" the authors wrote.\n  \"Among adults aged 18\u201349 years, the interim VE estimate against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was low and not statistically significant. Additional enrollment during the season while A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulate will determine whether VE against A(H1N1)pdm09 in this age group is lower than during previous seasons and will help evaluate potential contributing factors to lower than expected effectiveness.\"\n  The beginning of the US flu season was dominated by influenza B/Victoria, but since December, cases of H1N1 flu have increased.\n  Despite the protection, the authors said markers of severe illness, including laboratory-confirmed flu-associated hospitalization rates among children and adolescents, are higher than in recent seasons, including the severe 2017-18 season.\n  The authors also noted that the 92 flu-associated deaths in children are the most at this point in the season since reporting began in 2004-05, other than the 2009 pandemic season, and stress the importance of still getting vaccinated if people have not yet done so.\nSolid protection in Canada  The Canadian flu season was also defined by early influenza B/Victoria activity, but the flu vaccine has proved more effective so far, according to a Eurosurveillance study. Patients 1 year old and older presenting at study sites in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec were included in the study.  \n  Of the 2,808 specimens tested, 1,411 (50%) were influenza test-positive, including 731 (52%) influenza A and 683 (48%) influenza B viruses, with three influenza A and B co-infections. Of the influenza A cases, (77%) were H1N1 and 23% were H3N2. Among the influenza B detections, 99% were B/Victoria.\n  Overall, VE against any strain was 58%, including 74% in children ages 1 to 19 years, and 18% in adults 65 and older. VE was 44% against H1N1, 62% against H3N2, and 69% against influenza B. As in the United States, the vaccine provided better protection in children and adults under 50 seemed to get more protection from the vaccine.\n  \"The mid-season VE of 44% we report for A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses during the 2019/20 season is lower than we reported mid-season in 2018/19 (72%) [8], 2015/16 (64%) [12] or 2013/14 (74%),\" the authors wrote.\n  They conclude, \"Interim results from Canada's SPSN indicate that the 2019/20 influenza vaccine has provided substantial protection against medically-attended influenza illness during a season characterised by an approximately equal mix of influenza A and B viruses, a substantial proportion of which were genetically and antigenically mismatched to vaccine.\"\n  They also suggest the substantial VE despite a mismatch between the circulating strains and the vaccine strains, \"invites exploration of other factors potentially contributing to VE.\"",

Of the 309 samples tested for resistant E coli, no samples were positive for carbapenem resistance or plasmid-mediated colistin resistance, while 23 (8.4%) expressed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-phenotype resistance, 16 (5.2%) expressed AmpC-phenotype resistance, and 3 expressed both ESBL- and AmpC-phenotype resistance.\n  Overall, the proportion of chicken meat samples positive for ESBL-producing E coli fell from 65.4% in 2013-2014 to 8.4% in 2018, and AmpC-producing E coli fell from 16.3% in 2016 to 5.2% in 2018. The FSA said this decrease could be linked to the banning of cephalosporins in poultry meat flocks by the UK Poultry Council in 2012.\n  Of the 392 samples tested for resistant Campylobacter bacteria, ciprofloxacin resistance was detected in 52% of Campylobacter jejuni isolates (171/328), and 48% of Campylobacter coli isolates (31/65). Multidrug resistance was found in 5 of 328 C jejuni isolates (2%) and 6 of 65 C coli isolates (9%). Overall, the proportions of antibiotic-resistant and multidrug-resistant Campylobacter isolates identified were similar to those found in previous survey years.\n  \"While there is evidence that AMR bacteria are present on chicken sold in the UK, it is encouraging to see the levels holding steady and even reducing,\" Paul Cook, FSA science lead in microbiological risk assessment, said in an agency press release. \"The risk of getting AMR-related infections through eating or preparing contaminated meat remains very low as long as you follow good hygiene and cooking practices.\"\nFeb 18 FSA press release\nFeb 18 FSA E coli survey\nFeb 18 FSA Campylobacter survey\n\nStudy: Contact isolation doesn't reduce spread of resistant organisms   A study of patients in four European hospitals has found that contact isolation showed no benefit when added to standard precautions for controlling the spread of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) on non-critical care wards with extensive surveillance screening, researchers reported yesterday in the Lancet Infectious Diseases.\n  In the cluster-randomized trial conducted at university hospitals in Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland, patients in medical, surgical, and combined medical-surgical wards were randomized to continue standard precautions alone or implement contact isolation alongside standard precautions for 12 months, followed by a 1-month washout period and 12 months of an alternative strategy. Patients were screened for ESBL-E on carriage within 3 days of admission, once a week thereafter, and on discharge. The primary outcome was the incidence density of ESBL-E.\n  Between Jan 6, 2014, and Aug 31, 2016, 38,357 patients were admitted to the hospital wards. Among 15,184 patients with a length of stay of more than 1 week, 11,368 patients (75%) were screened at least twice. The incidence density of ward-acquired ESBL-E was 6.0 events per 1,000 patient-days at risk (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.4 to 6.7) during periods of contact isolation and 6.1 (95% CI, 5.5 to 6.7) during periods of standard precautions (P = 0\u00b79710). Multivariable analysis adjusted for length of stay, percentage of patients screened, and prevalence in first screening cultures yielded an incidence rate ratio of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.80 to 1.22; P = 0.9177) for care under contact isolation compared with standard precautions.\n  \"The results of this trial suggest that current real-life practice in many countries, including the targeted identification of carriers and expanded use of contact isolation, is ineffective in preventing the spread of ESBL-E in endemic settings,\" the authors conclude.\n  The findings are significant because while many guidelines recommend the use of contact isolation for patients colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria, several studies in recent years have questioned their effectiveness. In addition, research has shown that patients under contact isolation express greater dissatisfaction with their treatment.\nFeb 19 Lancet Infect Dis abstract\n\nTwo tests detect carbapenem resistance in lower respiratory tract samples  Spanish investigators yesterday in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy reported good results from using two commercial rapid diagnostic tests\u2014Xpert Carba-R and Eazyplex SuperBug CRE\u2014to detect bacterial carbapenem resistance genes directly in lower respiratory tract samples.\n  The researcher team used the two tests\u2014the former a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and the other employing loop-mediated isothermal amplification\u2014for detecting carbapenemase carriage in Enterobacteriaceae directly from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The researchers added well-characterized carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains to the BAL samples to observe how the tests would perform.\n  Xpert Carba-R demonstrated 100% agreement with carbapenemase characterization by PCR and sequencing for all final bacteria concentrations. Eazyplex SuperBug CRE showed 100%, 80% and 27% agreement with PCR and sequencing at diminishing pathogen concentrations. False-negative results for Eazyplex SuperBug CRE matched the highest cycle threshold values for Xpert Carba-R. Hands-on time for both assays was about 15\u2009min, but Eazyplex SuperBug CRE results were available within 30\u2009min, whereas Xpert Carba-R took around 50\u2009min.\n  The authors say their results could be used as proof-of-concept data for validating the tests for this purpose.\nFeb 19 J Antimicrob Chemother abstract\n\nNigeria reports 309 new Lassa fever cases, 472 total so far this year  In the first 5 weeks of 2020, Nigeria has confirmed 472 Lassa fever cases, including 70 deaths, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in an update today. The outbreak has grown by 309 confirmed cases and 46 deaths since a WHO update on Jan 28.\n  The cases were reported from Jan 1 through Feb 9, and 26 of 36 states are affected. Edo (167 cases) and Ondo (156) are by far the hardest-hit states.\n  Fifteen healthcare workers have contracted the disease, one of whom died. Another health worker who had a probable case also died. Officials confirmed 793 Lassa fever cases in Nigeria in all of 2019, but this year cases are outpacing those seen during the same period last year. \n  Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria, typically with an annual peak in the dry season (December through April) following the reproduction cycle of Mastomys rats (common African rats) in the wet season (May through June). \n  The WHO said, \"Given that 90-95% of human infections are due to indirect exposure to (through food or household items contaminated by infected rats' urine and faeces) or direct contact with infected Mastomys rats, the very high density and high circulation of Lassa fever virus in young non-immune rat population during the wet season create a potential for further human infection, thus, the number of infections is expected to continue to rise until the end of the dry season.\"\nFeb 20 WHO update\nJan 28 CIDRAP News scan on earlier report",

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "Source: http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-persp...e-african-kids\n\n\nQuestions remain about mass azithromycin use in African kids\nFiled Under:\nAntimicrobial Stewardship\nChris Dall | News Reporter | CIDRAP News\n | Feb 20, 2020\n\n\nTwo studies this week in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene are addressing some of the questions raised by a study that has linked mass distribution of an antibiotic to African preschool children to reduced childhood mortality. But the answers remain elusive.    The studies are offshoots of the MORDOR (Macrolides Oraux pour R\u00e9duire les D\u00e9c\u00e8s avec un Oeil sur la R\u00e9sistance) trial, a large randomized clinical trial that found that twice-a-year doses of azithromycin over 2 years to healthy children under the age of 5 was associated with a 14% reduction in childhood mortality in rural communities in Niger, Tanzania, and Malawi when compared with communities in which children received a placebo.\n  The results of the MORDOR trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2018, surprised the researchers, who thought they might see an impact on mortality but did not expect a 14% reduction. But they also raised concerns about whether mass distribution of azithromycin could promote antibiotic resistance and reduce the effectiveness of the drug.\n  The concerns about resistance were again raised when the researchers went back and looked at macrolide resistance in bacteria sampled from the children in Niger. That analysis found that the proportion of macrolide resistance Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was significantly higher in children who received azithromycin than in those who received a placebo.\n  But in one of the new studies\u2014another randomized controlled trial conducted in Tanzania in parallel to the original MORDOR mortality trial\u2014investigators found that, when compared with bacteria sampled from children in communities that had received a placebo, four biannual rounds of azithromycin treatment did not appear to result in excess azithromycin resistance over 24 months of follow-up.\nQuestions about resistance remain  The trial, conducted by members of the MORDOR field study team in 30 communities in Tanzania, looked at the proportion of azithromycin-resistant S pneumoniae and Escherichia coli isolates recovered from the nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs of children ages 1 to 59 months in communities that had been randomized to receive four biannual distributions of oral azithromycin or a placebo. The samples were collected from 40 children randomly selected from the communities at the beginning of the trial, at 12 months, and at 24 months.\n  The analysis did not find an excess in the proportion of azithromycin-resistant S pneumoniae and E coli isolates in the children who received azithromycin, nor did it find an increase in resistance over time. The respective proportions of azithromycin-resistant S pneumoniae isolates in the azithromycin versus placebo arms at baseline, 12, and 24 months were 26.5% versus 18.1% (P = 0.26), 26.8% versus 16.5% (P = 0.29), and 13.4% versus 17.0% (P = 0.57). The proportions of azithromycin-resistant isolates of E coli at baseline, 12, and 24 months in the azithromycin versus placebo arms were 14.9% versus 18.9% (P = 0.16), 21.5% versus 16.6% (P = 0.10), and 14.9% versus 14.7% (P = 0.95).\n  \"I don't know how to interpret it,\" said co-author Tom Lietman, MD, a member of the MORDOR study group and ophthalmologist at the University of California at San Francisco. \"My gut feeling is whenever you do a trial, it's actually difficult to show a result, even if it is there.\"\n  Lietman and his colleagues say there could be several reasons why they found no increase in resistance. One is that the treated children represent only a small fraction of the randomized communities, and that the rest of the population in those communities may have had a reservoir of susceptible S pneumoniae and E coli strains. In addition, the mean coverage of communities in the azithromycin arm was 75% to 78%, which means that nearly a quarter of children in the azithromycin-treated communities didn't receive the antibiotic and likely had susceptible strains.\n  \"Maybe the fact that a quarter of the children weren't treated allows this reservoir where the susceptible strains are doing just fine, and then they can repopulate the community pretty quickly,\" Lietman said.\n  Ultimately, the results provide little clarity on the big question raised by the MORDOR study.\n  \"I don't think we have resistance figured out with periodic mass antibiotics,\" he said. \"But I do think we're starting to understand the amount of resistance that will selected for by mass antibiotics.\"\n  Lietman said they've learned a few things so far. While mass distribution of azithromycin does select for antibiotic resistance, he explained, it appears to go away when the mass doses are stopped. In addition, they haven't observed dramatic increases in resistance to other antibiotic classes.\n  \"If we treat with azithromycin and the penicillin resistance goes up, that would be a problem,\" he said.\n  Lietman also noted that the MORDOR trials haven't selected for as much antibiotic resistance as the trachoma prevention programs in Africa, in which azithromycin doses are distributed to entire communities to eliminate ocular strains of Chlamydia that cause the disease.\n  It's also still unclear why giving children under 5 azythromycin is linked to reduced childhood mortality. An analysis earlier this month of MORDOR results from Niger found that mortality from malaria, pneumonia, meningitis, and diarrhea in the azithromycin-treated communities were all down compared with the communities that received placebo, so it's possible the antibiotic doses could be having an impact on all those conditions. But that's not a satisfying answer for those who have concerns about mass distribution of azithromycin, Lietman said.\n  \"If it was targeted to just one of those major killers, I think people might be more comfortable with the program,\" he said. \"We're comfortable targeting individual diseases, but we're not comfortable giving antibiotics out non-specifically.\"\nOptimizing the mortality benefit  Another question raised by the original MORDOR mortality study was whether mass azithromycin distribution should specifically target certain high-risk subgroups. That was highlighted by results showing that children ages 1 to 5 months in communities receiving azithromycin saw the greatest reduction in mortality (24.9% lower than in communities receiving placebo).\n  To see whether a targeted strategy might have an impact on the number of lives saved, Lietman and other researchers from the MORDOR study group went back in the second study and looked at mortality among three groups of children from 594 communities in Niger that received azithromycin or placebo: children aged 1 to 5 months, 1 to 11 months, and 1 to 59 months. Their aim was to estimate the number of deaths averted by azithromycin in those three groups.\n  What they found was that the number of deaths averted was among children ages 1 to 59 months (729) was nearly six times the number averted in the 1-to-5-month groups (126), and more than twice the number of deaths averted among the 1-to-11-month group (297).  \n  \"This suggests that a policy of targeted treatment would lead to fewer lives saved compared with mass treatment of all preschool-aged children,\" Lietman and his colleagues write in the study.\n  This is an example of the \"prevention paradox,\" Lietman explained. Targeting a high-risk group to receive azithromycin may result in a higher effect per person\u2014and in this case could hypothetically reduce the selection pressure for resistance\u2014but treating a wider group of children would have a larger overall impact on mortality.\n  \"Every time we try to target, we lose a bunch of kids who are also dying, even if at a lower rate,\" he said.\n  The next step in this research will be a larger trial in Niger, which aims to randomize all children under 5 in the country to receive azithromycin or placebo, one region at a time. That trial begins this summer.\nSee also:\n  May 2, 2018, CIDRAP News story \"African study on pre-emptive antibiotics in kids spurs resistance debate\"\n  Jun 6, 2019, CIDRAP News story \"Follow-up study: Mass azithromycin still tied to fewer child deaths\"",

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "Source: http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-persp...tics-pneumonia\n\n\nStudy raises questions about broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia\nFiled Under:\nAntimicrobial Stewardship; Pneumonia; MRSA\nChris Dall | News Reporter | CIDRAP News\n | Feb 19, 2020\n\n\n    A large study of patients hospitalized for pneumonia suggests that a treatment strategy designed to account for patients with antibiotic-resistant infections should be reconsidered.\n  The study, published this week in JAMA Internal Medicine, found that pneumonia patients who received empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics had a higher risk of death compared with those who received standard antibiotic therapy. They also had a higher risk of kidney injury, along with Clostridioides difficile and other secondary infections.\n  The authors of the study say the findings are a good example of how efforts to improve clinical outcomes for patients can sometimes lead clinicians to adopt practices that aren't backed by solid evidence. In the case of pneumonia, concerns about possible infection with resistant organisms like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa has led to a strategy of early broad-spectrum antibiotics for certain patients.\n  \"The underlying assumption of this approach is that the benefit of more potent antibiotics during the empirical phase exceeds the harms,\" they write. \"Our study questions this assumption.\"\nNo benefit, increased risk of harm  The strategy goes back to the 2005 guidelines from the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America for treatment of adults who have community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Those guidelines recommended that pneumonia patients who lived in nursing homes or had been in the hospital in the previous 90 days should be labeled as having healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics like vancomycin or piperacillin-tazobactam to cover for the possibility that the pneumonia was caused by MRSA or Pseudomonas.\n  Subsequently, a 2015 study of patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system found that, after those guidelines were published, a substantial shift in treatment of CAP patients occurred, with the proportion of vancomycin prescribing rising from 16% in 2006 to 31% in 2010 and piperacillin-tazobactam prescribing jumping from 16% to 27%. This shift occurred even though less than 5% of patients in the study had resistant bacteria detected.\n  But it's unclear which patients, and how many, are benefitting from the use of more potent antibiotics.\n  To get a better sense of how empiric broad-spectrum therapy is affecting clinical outcomes in CAP patients, a team led by investigators from the VA Salt Lake City Health Care System and the University of Utah conducted a retrospective cohort study of all CAP hospitalizations in the VA health care system from 2008 through 2013.\n  They specifically looked at the 30-day mortality rate associated with three empirical treatment regimens: standard antibiotics alone, standard antibiotics plus anti-MRSA therapy, and anti-MRSA therapy without standard antibiotics. Secondary outcomes included development of kidney injury and secondary infections with C difficile, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species, or gram-negative bacteria.\n  Of the 88,605 CAP patients analyzed in the study, empirical anti-MRSA antibiotics were administered to 33,632 (38%), with 13,528 receiving empirical anti-MRSA therapy with standard antibiotics and 20,104 receiving anti-MRSA therapy without standard antibiotics. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 10% (8,929 patients). Only 2% of the patients (2,154) had MRSA detected by clinical culture.\n  After adjusting for comorbidities and other patient characteristics that might affect treatment regimens and risk of 30-day mortality, the analysis found that empirical anti-MRSA treatment plus standard therapy was significantly associated with greater 30-day mortality compared with standard therapy alone (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 1.5), as was anti-MRSA treatment with non-standard therapy (aRR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.4 to 1.6).\n  Analysis of secondary outcomes showed that patients receiving anti-MRSA treatment and standard therapy also had a higher risk of kidney injury (aRR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3 to 1.5), secondary C difficile infections (aRR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 1.9), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp (aRR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.3), and secondary gram-negative bacteria detection (aRR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.8).\n  In addition, similar associations between anti-MRSA therapy and higher 30-day mortality were found when the researchers looked at sub-groups of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (aRR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.5), those with a high risk for MRSA (aRR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.4), and those with MRSA detected on surveillance testing (aRR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 1.9). There was no significant difference in risk of 30-day mortality, however, for patients with a MRSA-positive culture (aRR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.4).\n  \"These findings, which were robust to multiple methods of analysis, contribute to a growing body of evidence that raises questions surrounding widespread empirical use of extended-spectrum antibiotics in patients with community-acquired pneumonia,\" the authors write.\nRethinking the 'more is better' mantra  For Michael Klompas, MD, MPH, a professor of population medicine at Harvard Medical School and author of an editorial that accompanies the study, the data from this analysis and other studies make a compelling argument that broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia should be avoided until it's clear they are needed.\n  \"The messages are clear: empirical coverage with broad-spectrum agents is not indicated in most patients being treated for pneumonia, and if the diagnosis of pneumonia is uncertain, there is no harm and likely some benefit in taking some time to acquire more diagnostic clarity before treating (such as further imaging, laboratory testing, treating concurrent conditions, and/or observation), so long as the patient is clinically stable,\" he writes.\n  Valerie Vaughn, MD, a hospitalist at the University of Michigan's academic medical center who was not involved in the study, says the findings are significant because there's long been a concern among clinicians that CAP patients are being overtreated, given the fact that MRSA is still a very rare cause of pneumonia.\n  \"There was this growing sense that we'd swung the pendulum too far, and were very focused on trying to make sure that we didn't miss any patients with MRSA, so anybody that had a risk for MRSA we treated with vancomycin,\" Vaughn said. \"We really focused on the risk of missing patients that might have MRSA, and less about the potential harms of overtreating what is a much larger number of patients who don't have MRSA pneumonia.\"\n  Vaughn hopes that this study, along with revamped CAP guidelines published in October 2019, will spur changes in the how clinicians treat these patients. The new guidelines support abandoning the term HCAP, and recommend that clinicians treat patient empirically for MRSA or Pseudomonas only if locally validated risk factors for either pathogen are present.\n  \"This is definitely something that's been in the front of our minds, the fact that we need to rethink the doctrine that more is better, and that the benefit of catching resistant organisms early in a few patients outweighs the harms of antibiotic side effects in the many who end up not having resistant organisms, or actually may not have pneumonia at all,\" she said.\n  Vaughn said the next step for reducing unnecessary antibiotic treatment for pneumonia, which is often overdiagnosed, is development of better diagnostic tools.\n  \"We still don't have a good way of diagnosing pneumonia, or diagnosing pathogens for patients who do have pneumonia,\" she said. \"We need better diagnostics tools, and better ways of using those tools.\"\nSee also:\n  Oct 2, 2019, CIDRAP News story \"Guidance on community-acquired pneumonia updated\"",

The country's overall outbreak total stands at 74,185. It reported 136 more deaths lifting the outbreak's fatality count to 2,004. And health officials added 236 new serious cases, raising that total to 11,977.\n  An international joint mission led by the World Health Organization (WHO) in its fourth day of meetings in the country, where the experts are meeting with Chinese officials to learn more about the outbreak and to offer their assistance.\n  In other outbreak developments, China changed its COVID-19 case definition again, and instead of counting clinically diagnosed cases as confirmed infections, it will classify them as suspected cases, according to a government statement.\nIran cases both fatal  Earlier today, Iran's health ministry today reported the country's first two COVID-19 cases, which it said were preliminary positives that were undergoing further testing. It said the cases were detected in Qom, a holy city with a population of about 1.3 million located about 78 miles south of Tehran.\n  Then later today, media reports, citing Iran's health ministry, said the two patients died from the disease. Few details were available about the patients, other than that they were both elderly and had acute lung infections, Al Jazeera reported.\n  Iran is the third country in the Middle East to report COVID-19 cases and the first in the region to report fatal cases. The United Arab Emirates and Egypt are other countries that have reported cases.\nJapan, Singapore, South Korea cases rise  Japan's health ministry today reported seven new cases, one of them asymptomatic, raising the country's total to 73. Three cases, including the asymptomatic one, are from Wakayama prefecture, three are from Tokyo, and one is from Aichi prefecture.\n  One of the patients from Wakayama prefecture is the son of a doctor who worked at Saiseikai Arida Hospital, whose illness was confirmed on Feb 14, Jiji Press reported yesterday. The other two are a nurse who worked on the Diamond Princess medical assistance team and a patient who shared a room with a previously identified  COVID-19 patient.\n  In Singapore, the health ministry today reported three more cases, one linked to a known church cluster, one linked to a different church cluster, and one with a still-undetermined exposure source. The country now has 84 cases. Contact links have been found for all but eight locally transmitted cases.\n  Elsewhere, South Korea today reported 20 new cases, 14 of them linked to church services in the city of Daegu, Reuters reported yesterday. The confirmations bring the country's overall total to 51. Citing a statement from the Korea Centers for Disease Control, it said the country's 31st patient, a 61-year-old woman, is linked to infections in at least 15 people who attended church services with her, plus a contact at the facility where she was hospitalized. Health officials have said the cluster of cases marks a super spreading event.\nDiamond Princess total reaches 621  Also today, Japan's health ministry today reported that 79 more people on the Diamond Princess have tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, of whom 68 are asymptomatic. The new cases raise the total to 621.\n  The quarantined cruise ship has been in Yokohama port since Feb 3.\n  In related developments, hundreds of passengers who tested negative have started leaving the ship, now that their 14-day quarantine period is over, according to a BBC reported today, which also cited a Japanese expert who visited the ship and found inadequate infection control.\n  Yesterday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Diamond Princess passengers and crew are restricted from entering the United States for at least 14 days after they leave the ship, due to ongoing risk. It added though Japan took extraordinary efforts to quarantine the ship, they may not have been enough to prevent transmission among people on the ship.\n  The cruise ship company said today that Canada, Australia, and Hong Kong are coordinating charter flights for their citizens, which are expected to arrive today. All will be subject to 14-day quarantines and COVID-19 testing when they arrive home. For those not taking evacuation flights, Japan's health ministry is requiring a negative test before individuals exit the ship.\n  In a related development, the World Health Organization (WHO) today shared more details about the Westerdam cruise ship that was recently allowed to disembark in Cambodia, efforts that were halted after an American passenger tested positive for the virus after traveling on the Malaysia. It said 18 of 2,257 people were sick during the voyage, but samples were taken from 20 who had flulike symptoms, and all were negative for the virus before the passengers were allowed to disembark.\n  Temperature screening before the passengers left the ship found no people with fever.\n  In response to the positive test in the American woman, health screening and testing for COVID-19 are under way for all people still on the ship or are still in Cambodia. It said the WHO, CDC, Pasteur Institute, and related embassies are on the ground in Sihanoukville where the ship is located and in Phnom Penh.\n  The WHO said today in its daily update that over the past 24 hours it has received 120 new reports of COVID-19 cases outside China from 25 countries, 3 of them fatal. However, 542 of those are from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Excluding the ship cluster, Singapore has the highest number of cases outside of China, followed by Japan.\nCDC Hong Kong travel watch  The CDC today posted a travel watch, the lowest level that urges people to practice usual precautions, for Hong Kong, the second location to have an advisory for COVID-19.\n  It said the ongoing outbreak has spread to Hong Kong, where multiple instances of community spread have been reported. In an update today, Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection said 62 cases have been confirmed so far, including 2 new ones today.\n  The administrative region has imposed a quarantine for China mainland travelers and has urged people to take social distancing steps. Today the CHP announced enhanced surveillance and testing for people who have fever and respiratory symptoms at outpatient clinics and hospital emergency departments to help detect mild cases and provide a better understanding of the epidemiological situation.",

But in a study published in Emerging Microbes & Infections, Chinese scientists report evidence of an oral-fecal transmission route for COVID-19 viruses and show that, in hospitalized patients, viral RNA was found in anal swabs and in blood samples.\n  The study was conducted in a Wuhan, China, hospital, with samples collected from 178 patients. The study authors found viral nucleotide in anal swabs or blood even when it was not detected in oral swabs, especially in patients who had been receiving supportive care for several days.\n  The results also showed that the timing of positive swabs changed. On the first day of illness, 80% of oral swabs were positive in a small group of patients, but by day 5, 75% of anal swabs were positive for COVID-19 virual RNA, and only 50% of oral swabs were still positive in the same patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19.\n  \"These data suggested a shift from more oral positive during early period (as indicated by antibody titres) to more anal positive during later period might happen,\" the authors said.\n  The results of the study are the first to show COVID-19 could be transmitted via respiratory, fecal-oral, or body fluid routes, the authors say. They also warn that a patient with negative oral swabs after several days of illness may still be capable of transmitting the virus.\n  In a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control, authors describe how they isolated the virus from a stool sample of a patient with COVID-19\n  \"Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are considered to be the most important routes of transmission of 2019-nCoV, but do not fully account for the occurrence of all coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, previously known as novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), and the reasons for the rapid spread of this virus,\" they write.\n  The finding suggests stool can contaminate hands, food, water, and, as with the other study, it points to multiple routes of transmission.\nMilder symptoms in non-Wuhan Chinese patients  Today in The BMJ, Chinese scientists looked at the clinical findings of 62 COVID-19 patients from seven hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. None of the patients died, and only one patient was admitted to the intensive care unit.\n  Of the 62 patients, 48 (77%) presented with a fever, 50 (81%) had a cough, 35 (56%) had a productive cough, 32 (52%) reported muscle pain or fatigue, and 21 (34%) had a headache. Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on admission, the authors said.\n  The authors said that, compared with patients in Wuhan, the patients seen in Zhejiang had relatively mild symptoms. None of the patients had exposure to the Wuhan seafood market linked to the origin of the virus, and all had contracted the disease front another infected person.\n  Patients who experienced symptoms for the more than 10 days were more likely to have underlying health issues.\n  The authors also provided a timeline for infection: \"Among 56 patients who could provide the exact date of close contact with someone with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, the median incubation period from exposure to symptoms was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days). The median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2.0 (1.0-4.3) days.\"\n  SARS-CoV-2 is another name for the COVID-19 virus.\n  In a study from The Lancet Infectious Diseases, meanwhile, investigators detailed the first case of COVID-19 in a Vietnamese woman who acquired the virus in China. The woman lived in Wuhan for business for 2 months in December and January and did not report visiting the Wuhan seafood market or having close contact with any person with influenza-like symptoms.\n  The woman lived with two other Vietnamese colleagues in Wuhan, and they also developed COVID-19 upon return to Vietnam. After being admitted to the hospital with fever and respiratory symptoms, the woman recovered within 9 days.\n  \"21 people with direct contact with this patient were also isolated. Until February 6, none of these individuals had developed symptoms. As the patient's two colleagues tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, this suggested transmission via respiratory droplets,\" the authors concluded.",

Officials said they are taking all necessary precautions to prevent the disease from spreading.\n  Officials did not say whether the man had traveled recently, had recent contact with camels, or had other risk factors. They also did not say where the man is from or where he is hospitalized.\n  Qatar officials confirmed three MERS cases in late December 2019. Before that, the country had not reported a case since 2017.\n  The World Health Organization said in its latest monthly update that, since 2012, it has received reports of 2,499 MERS-CoV cases, at least 861 of them fatal. The vast majority of these cases were in Saudi Arabia.\nFeb 18 Qatar MOPH news release\nDec 27, 2019, CIDRAP News scan on earlier cases\n\nCDC, FDA, say Salmonella outbreak tied to fruit appears over  Yesterday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) both announced an end to their investigations into a Salmonella outbreak first identified in December tied to cut fruit produced by Tailor Cut Produce of North Brunswick, New Jersey.\n  The CDC said officials confirmed 69 new cases recorded since its Jan 2 update, for a total of 165 cases reported since early December 2019 in 14 states. Seventy-three patients were hospitalized, and there were no deaths. Illness-onset dates ranged from Nov 7, 2019, to Jan 11, 2020.\n  \"Illnesses were reported from states where Tailor Cut Produce distributed cut fruit, including Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. Most ill people from the other 10 states reported traveling to at least one of these 4 states in the week before their illness started,\" the CDC said.\n  On Dec 7, Tailor Cut Produce recalled its Fruit Luau cut fruit mix as well as cut honeydew melon, cantaloupe, and pineapple products because they had the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella bacteria.\nFeb 18 CDC update\nFeb 18 FDA report\n\nH7N9 avian flu follow-up study reveals persistent lung problems  A follow-up study of 61 people in China who survived H7N9 avian flu hospitalizations in three of the country's five outbreak waves found persistent lung damage and ongoing pulmonary dysfunction. A team from China published its findings yesterday in EClinicalMedicine.\n  The survivors were from five provinces and Beijing, and between Aug 2013 and Sep 2018, researchers conducted follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months after illness onset. For a subset of patients, assessments were repeated at 18 and 64 months. The medical exam included dyspnea assessment, chest auscultation, pulmonary function testing, and chest computed tomography (CT).\n  The cumulative rate of pulmonary dysfunction was 38.5% at the 18-month follow-up visit and 78.2% for chest CT abnormalities, also at the 18-month follow-up visit. Pulmonary function tests showed that 38.1% has a restrictive pattern of lung disease at the 3-month visit, which slowly resolved. The researchers observed an obstructive pattern in 14.3% at the 3-month visit, which persisted for about a year. They also found that abnormalities on chest CT persisted after pulmonary function improved.\n  The investigators said the pulmonary problems they found persisted longer than what was reported for patients hospitalized with pandemic or seasonal flu. The team concluded that the findings add to the understanding of H7N9 disease severity and underscore the importance of long-term follow-up studies to gauge the impact of infections with influenza A viruses.\n  Since early 2013, China experienced five H7N9 waves, which resulted in 1,567 illnesses, at least 615 of them fatal, according to the WHO.\nFeb 18 EClinicalMedicine report\nSep 2018 WHO H7N9 background information",

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "What is self-isolation and why is it important? Posted by:Blog Editor, Posted on:20 February 2020 - Categories:Health Protection\n\n\nWe recently blogged about contact tracing, an important technique we use to stop diseases like COVID-19 from spreading. Part of the contact tracing process may involve asking someone who has had close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 to self-isolate at home.\n\nIn this blog, we will explain what self-isolation is, why it is important, and which groups are currently being advised to self-isolate.\n\nSelf-isolation is about protecting others and stopping the spread of COVID-19. It is very important that anyone who has or might have been exposed to the virus limits the number of people they come into contact with for 14 days. This is the most effective way of preventing the coronavirus from spreading.\n\nIf you are asked to self-isolate, it is important that you follow the advice which is there to help keep you, your loved ones, and your community safe. Self-isolation may seem tricky at first, but across the country, hundreds of people have already successfully done it. If you have been told to self-isolate too, all the instructions you need to follow are available in this advice sheet and the tips in this blog should help to make things easier.\n\nWe will update this blog as new information becomes available, so bookmark this page now and keep checking back. Who needs to self-isolate?Currently in the UK, self-isolation is relevant to several groups of people: People who are waiting for a COVID-19 test resultIf you have travelled back from an area where the coronavirus is known to be present and have symptoms, you may have been asked to take a COVID-19 test. Whilst waiting for the results of tests for COVID-19 coronavirus infection, you will be advised by your local health protection team and your doctor to stay at home and self-isolate. Follow the important instructions detailed on this advice sheet.  People who are identified as being a close contact of someone with coronavirusAt the moment, we are undertaking contact tracing to prevent the infection spreading further.\n\nThis contact tracing work may lead to more people being advised to self-isolate. Find out more about how this process works in our explainer blog.  TravellersIf you have travelled back from Wuhan or Hubei Province in China you should stay indoors for 14 days even if you do not have any symptoms of the virus as the risk of developing symptoms is much higher.\n\nAnyone who has symptoms of any kind who has returned to the UK from the following areas should self-isolate and call NHS 111 or outside England equivalent (details on this page):China\nThailand\nJapan\nRepublic of Korea\nHong Kong\nTaiwan\nSingapore\nMalaysia\nMacau\nWhat if I am in another group?We are not currently advising that individuals outside of the groups above should self-isolate.\n\nAsking wider groups of people with symptoms to self-isolate is a measure sometimes used when an infection is spreading in the community, for instance during the winter if you suspected you had flu you would remain at home to avoid passing it on to people in your community or at work. If we recommend this action, we\u2019ll immediately inform the public and provide additional advice. What does self-isolating mean?If you have been told to self-isolate, you will need to stay indoors and avoid contact with other people. This will prevent you from spreading the disease to your family, friends and the wider community.\n\nIn practical terms, this means that you must:stay at home\nnot go to work, school or public areas\nnot use public transport like buses, trains, tubes or taxis\navoid visitors to your home\nask friends, family members or delivery services to carry out errands for you \u2013 such as getting groceries, medications or other shopping\nIf I do not have any symptoms, do I need to self-isolate?It is important that if you fall in any of the groups listed above, you follow the relevant self-isolation advice even if you do not have any symptoms. What if I get symptoms during those 14 days?If you experience a cough, a fever, or breathing difficulties, call NHS111 and tell them you are being asked to self-isolate because of coronavirus. If you have been given a designated medical contact point you can also contact them for advice. They will talk you through the next steps.\n\nEven if the symptoms seem like mild respiratory symptoms, it is better to call for advice. How do I get food or supplies?It is fine for friends, family or delivery drivers to drop off food for you. Alternatively, you can order by phone or online, such as through take away services or online shopping deliveries. However, make sure you tell the delivery driver that the items are to be left outside, or in the porch, or as appropriate for your home. I live with other people, how do I self-isolate?It is important that you separate yourself from other people in your home and if you share facilities like toilets and bathrooms, regular cleaning will be required.\n\nYou should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened, separate from other people in your home.\n\nIn the advice sheet, there are specific recommendations in the case that a separate bathroom is not available, if you live in shared accommodation, and if you share a kitchen with others, and these should be followed closely.  What if I have other responsibilities, such as work and taking care of family?Unfortunately, if you have COVID-19 or are at higher risk of being infected, we must prioritise reducing the risk of transmitting the disease to others, particularly to people who may be more vulnerable such as older people or people with health conditions.\n\nDuring an outbreak, it is important that we all do everything we can to reduce the risk of further spread of the infection. This will require understanding and support from employers, family members and friends.Talk to those around you, including your employer, about the importance of self-isolation to reduce the risk of spreading infection at work. If you are well, you can work from home\nMake plans with your family and friends on how to manage shopping, dropping children to schools and events\nAsk people to not visit your house for your duration; if you need a healthcare or care visit at home during this time, inform them that you are self-isolating in advance so that they can follow their local employers guidance\nI am finding this hard, what should I do?We understand that for some people self-isolation can be boring or frustrating. You may find your mood and feelings being affected and you may feel low, worried or have problems sleeping. You may also feel isolated and alone.\n\nHowever, we would not ask you to do this if it was not important. There are simple things you can do that may help, such as staying in touch with friends and relatives on the phone or by social media and you may find it helpful to talk to them, if you want to.\n\nThere are also resources you can use, including:Every Mind Matters\nGood Thinking, the NHS approved wellbeing service providing tools and resources to help you feel better\n\nhttps://publichealthmatters.blog.gov...-it-important/",

At the time of writing, SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV, has spread to more than 26 countries around the world. According to the WHO COVID-19 situation report-28 released on Feb 17, 2020, more than 71\u2008000 cases have been confirmed and at least 1770 deaths.\n\nCoronaviruses are a family of single-stranded enveloped RNA viruses that are divided into four major genera. The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is 82% similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 1\n and both belong to the \u03b2-genus of the coronavirus family.  2\n Human coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are known to cause respiratory and enteric symptoms.  \u2022 View related content for this article\n\nIn the SARS outbreak of 2002\u201303, 16\u201373% of patients with SARS had diarrhoea during the course of the disease, usually within the first week of illness. 3\n SARS-CoV RNA was only detected in stools from the fifth day of illness onwards, and the proportion of stool specimens positive for viral RNA progressively increased and peaked at day 11 of the illness, with viral RNA still present in the faeces of a small proportion of patients even after 30 days of illness.  4\n The mechanism for gastrointestinal tract infection of SARS-CoV is proposed to be the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor.  2\n\n\nIn the initial MERS-CoV outbreak in 2012, a quarter of patients with MERS-CoV reported gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea or abdominal pain at presentation. 5\n Some patients initially presented with both fever and gastrointestinal symptoms before subsequent manifestation of more severe respiratory symptoms.  6\n Corman and colleagues  7\n found MERS-CoV RNA in 14\u00b76% of stool samples from patients with MERS-CoV. In-vitro studies have shown that MERS-CoV can infect and replicate in human primary intestinal epithelial cells, potentially via the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 receptor.  8\n In-vivo studies showed inflammation and epithelial degeneration in the small intestines, with subsequent development of pneumonia and brain infection.  8\n These results suggest that MERS-CoV pulmonary infection was secondary to the intestinal infection.\n\nIn early reports from Wuhan, 2\u201310% of patients with COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. 9\n, 10\n Abdominal pain was reported more frequently in patients admitted to the intensive care unit than in individuals who did not require intensive care unit care, and 10% of patients presented with diarrhoea and nausea 1\u20132 days before the development of fever and respiratory symptoms.  9\n SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in the stool of a patient in the USA.  11\n The binding affinity of ACE2 receptors is one of the most important determinants of infectivity, and structural analyses predict that SARS-CoV-2 not only uses ACE2 as its host receptor, but uses human ACE2 more efficiently than the 2003 strain of SARS-CoV (although less efficiently than the 2002 strain).  2\n\n\nData exist to support the notion that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are viable in environmental conditions that could facilitate faecal\u2013oral transmission. SARS-CoV RNA was found in the sewage water of two hospitals in Beijing treating patients with SARS. 12\n When SARS-CoV was seeded into sewage water obtained from the hospitals in a separate experiment, the virus was found to remain infectious for 14 days at 4\u00b0C, but for only 2 days at 20\u00b0C.  12\n\n\nSARS-CoV can survive for up to 2 weeks after drying, remaining viable for up to 5 days at temperatures of 22\u201325\u00b0C and 40\u201350% relative humidity, with a gradual decline in virus infectivity thereafter. 13\n Viability of the SARS-CoV virus decreased after 24 h at 38\u00b0C and 80\u201390% relative humidity.  13\n MERS-CoV is viable in low temperature, low humidity conditions. The virus was viable on different surfaces for 48 h at 20\u00b0C and 40% relative humidity, although viability decreased to 8 h at 30\u00b0C and 80% relative humidity conditions.  14\n At present, no viability data are available for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe viability of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV under various conditions and their prolonged presence in the environment suggest the potential for coronaviruses to be transmitted via contact or fomites. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are both viable in conditions with low temperatures and humidity. 12\n, 13\n, 14\n Although direct droplet transmission is an important route of transmission, faecal excretion, environmental contamination, and fomites might contribute to viral transmission. Considering the evidence of faecal excretion for both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and their ability to remain viable in conditions that could facilitate faecal\u2013oral transmission, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted via this route.\n\nThe possibility of faecal\u2013oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has implications, especially in areas with poor sanitation. Coronaviruses are susceptible to antiseptics containing ethanol, and disinfectants containing chlorine or bleach. 15\n Strict precautions must be observed when handling the stools of patients infected with coronavirus, and sewage from hospitals should also be properly disinfected. The importance of frequent and proper hand hygiene should be emphasised.\n\nFuture research on the possibility of faecal\u2013oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should include environmental studies to determine whether the virus remains viable in conditions that would favour such transmission. Study of the enteric involvement and viral excretion of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces is required to investigate whether faecal concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA correlate with the severity of the disease and presence or absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, and whether faecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA can also be detected in the incubation or convalescence phases of COVID-19.\n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/l...5mGcYI.twitter",

Published online February 19, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.2342\n\nCOVID-19 Resource Center\n\n\n\n\n   The novel coronavirus has now infected tens of thousands of people in China and has spread rapidly around the globe.1 The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and released interim guidelines on patient management.2 Early reports that emerged from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, demonstrated that the clinical manifestations of infection were fever, cough, and dyspnea, with radiological evidence of viral pneumonia.3,4 Approximately 15% to 30% of these patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The WHO interim guidelines made general recommendations for treatment of ARDS in this setting, including that consideration be given to referring patients with refractory hypoxemia to expert centers capable of providing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).2\n   ECMO is a form of modified cardiopulmonary bypass in which venous blood is removed from the body and pumped through an artificial membrane lung in patients who have refractory respiratory or cardiac failure.5 Oxygen is added, carbon dioxide is removed, and blood is returned to the patient, either via another vein to provide respiratory support or a major artery to provide circulatory support. ECMO is a resource-intensive, highly specialized, and expensive form of life support with the potential for significant complications, in particular hemorrhage and nosocomial infection. Recent evidence suggests that use of ECMO in the most severe cases of ARDS is associated with reduced mortality.6 There is some evidence that outcomes from ECMO are better in higher-volume centers.7\n   The role of ECMO in the management of COVID-19 is unclear at this point. It has been used in some patients with COVID-19 in China but detailed information is unavailable.3 ECMO may have a role in the management of some patients with COVID-19 who have refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure.6 However, much about the virus is unknown, including the natural history, incidence of late complications, viral persistence, or the prognoses in different subsets of patients. This uncertainty might be compared to the emergence of influenza A(H1N1) in 2009, when it was initially unclear what the role of ECMO should be.8 However, the degree of uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 is much greater. To address this, prompt mobilization of existing registries and clinical research groups should help facilitate the systematic collection of data. For example, the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry is being adapted to acquire new information about COVID-19 and prospective observational studies are under way.\n   ECMO does not provide direct support for organs other than the lungs or heart beyond increasing systemic oxygen delivery and mitigating ventilator-induced lung injury. A substantial proportion of critically ill patients with COVID-19 appear to have developed cardiac arrhythmias or shock,3 but it is unknown how many have or will develop refractory multiorgan failure, for which ECMO may be of more limited use. To postulate about the potential benefit of ECMO in this infection, more data on the mechanism of death and disease are required. The virus may cause death through progressive hypoxic respiratory failure, septic shock, refractory multiorgan failure, or by precipitating exacerbation of comorbid diseases such as ischemic heart disease or cardiac failure, but the relative proportions of these diseases in large cohorts of patients with COVID-19 infection are unknown.\n   The global spread of COVID-19, although the number of cases outside of China remains small, will likely occur via many dispersed epicenters where local transmission has become established. If these epicenters occur in sophisticated health care systems with preexisting ECMO programs, this will provide vital information about the utility of ECMO and help anticipate global demand. Should the initial experience be encouraging, it is likely that non-ECMO centers will refer early to ECMO centers in anticipation of impending clinical deterioration. This will disproportionately affect hospitals with ECMO programs, even when ECMO is not required.\n   Furthermore, with the apparent contagiousness of this virus and the relatively high numbers of patients who require intensive care, this may prove very resource-consumptive. Countries will need to pay specific attention to the considerable investment needed to provide ECMO during this outbreak. Judgment will be needed to decide when ECMO may be worthwhile and when it may not, understanding that the risk-to-benefit ratio of performing ECMO in these circumstances is dynamic and dependent on many factors. If the mechanism of death in COVID-19 ultimately includes a substantial number of patients with septic shock or refractory multiorgan failure, then the shift away from ECMO is likely to occur earlier because the most severely ill patients in this cohort would be less likely to benefit. The higher the all-cause mortality, the less relevant ECMO becomes.\n   Regardless, ECMO is clearly a finite resource. In a large outbreak, additional limitations to providing ECMO may include a lack of ECMO consoles or disposable equipment, suitably trained staff, or isolation rooms with the requisite infrastructure. Many materials necessary to make ECMO circuitry are manufactured in China and it is conceivable that the outbreak may disrupt supply chains.\n   A number of different models of ECMO service provision exist worldwide, ranging from a relative lack of regulation and centralization\u2014with many hospitals having ECMO capability but often with very low case volumes (eg, in the US or Japan)\u2014through to regional or national coordination of ECMO referral centers with dedicated interhospital retrieval teams (eg, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Qatar, the United Kingdom, or Sweden). In response to influenza A(H1N1) in 2009, some countries such as Italy adopted the latter model and it is possible that COVID-19 could be addressed similarly. The advantages of such an approach include standardization of indications, management, data collection, and containment.5,7 The disadvantage is the potential for hospitals that provide ECMO to be overwhelmed with critically ill patients unless interhospital transfers are centrally coordinated.\n   With the WHO recommendation for ECMO in place and the tropism of the COVID-19 virus for severe respiratory illness, the number of cases in which ECMO is used may increase over the course of this outbreak. However, there may come a tipping point. Should the case volume in any given region increase beyond the ability to provide routine care, any earlier increase in ECMO use may give way, with utilization later decreasing in proportion to the overwhelming demands on the system as a whole.\n   Support with ECMO is for the most critically ill patients in regions with the extensive resources required to provide this therapy. ECMO is not a therapy to be rushed to the frontline when all resources are stretched in a pandemic. In less well-resourced countries, many more lives will be saved by ensuring oxygen and pulse oximetry are widely available. Mitigation efforts to slow the outbreak are critical so that health care systems are not overwhelmed and all patients receive the correct management, whether simply confirmation of the diagnosis and appropriate quarantine, oxygen therapy alone, mechanical ventilation or, for those most likely to benefit, ECMO.\n\n\nBack to top  Article Information\n\nCorresponding Author: Graeme MacLaren, MSc, Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit, National University Health System, 5 Lower Kent Ridge Rd, Singapore 119074 (gmaclaren@iinet.net.au).\nPublished Online: February 19, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.2342\n\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jam...pRrrzCOUOsszx4",

The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure (MCM) development, we determined a 3.5 \u00c5-resolution cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also show biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S. Additionally, we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019-nCoV S, suggesting antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two RBDs. The structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable rapid development and evaluation of MCMs to address the ongoing public health crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://science.sciencemag.org/conte...BxgvlPsEYRP2V0",

SARS-CoV-2 is genetically related to SARS-CoV, which caused a global epidemic with 8096 confirmed cases in more than 25 countries in 2002\u20132003.1 The epidemic of SARS-CoV was successfully contained through public health interventions, including case detection and isolation. Transmission of SARS-CoV occurred mainly after days of illness2 and was associated with modest viral loads in the respiratory tract early in the illness, with viral loads peaking approximately 10 days after symptom onset.3 We monitored SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in upper respiratory specimens obtained from 18 patients (9 men and 9 women; median age, 59 years; range, 26 to 76) in Zhuhai, Guangdong, China, including 4 patients with secondary infections (1 of whom never had symptoms) within two family clusters (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). The patient who never had symptoms was a close contact of a patient with a known case and was therefore monitored. A total of 72 nasal swabs (sampled from the mid-turbinate and nasopharynx) (Figure 1A) and 72 throat swabs (Figure 1B) were analyzed, with 1 to 9 sequential samples obtained from each patient. Polyester flock swabs were used for all the patients.\n\nFrom January 7 through January 26, 2020, a total of 14 patients who had recently returned from Wuhan and had fever (\u226537.3\u00b0C) received a diagnosis of Covid-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) by means of reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction assay with primers and probes targeting the N and Orf1b genes of SARS-CoV-2; the assay was developed by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Samples were tested at the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Thirteen of 14 patients with imported cases had evidence of pneumonia on computed tomography (CT). None of them had visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan within 14 days before symptom onset. Patients E, I, and P required admission to intensive care units, whereas the others had mild-to-moderate illness. Secondary infections were detected in close contacts of Patients E, I, and P. Patient E worked in Wuhan and visited his wife (Patient L), mother (Patient D), and a friend (Patient Z) in Zhuhai on January 17. Symptoms developed in Patients L and D on January 20 and January 23, respectively, with viral RNA detected in their nasal and throat swabs soon after symptom onset. Patient Z reported no clinical symptoms, but his nasal swabs (cycle threshold [Ct] values, 22 to 28) and throat swabs (Ct values, 30 to 32) tested positive on days 7, 10, and 11 after contact. A CT scan of Patient Z that was obtained on February 6 was unremarkable. Patients I and P lived in Wuhan and visited their daughter (Patient H) in Zhuhai on January 11 when their symptoms first developed. Fever developed in Patient H on January 17, with viral RNA detected in nasal and throat swabs on day 1 after symptom onset.\n\nWe analyzed the viral load in nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients in relation to day of onset of any symptoms (Figure 1C). Higher viral loads (inversely related to Ct value) were detected soon after symptom onset, with higher viral loads detected in the nose than in the throat. Our analysis suggests that the viral nucleic acid shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 resembles that of patients with influenza4 and appears different from that seen in patients infected with SARS-CoV.3 The viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients, which suggests the transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients. These findings are in concordance with reports that transmission may occur early in the course of infection5 and suggest that case detection and isolation may require strategies different from those required for the control of SARS-CoV. How SARS-CoV-2 viral load correlates with culturable virus needs to be determined. Identification of patients with few or no symptoms and with modest levels of detectable viral RNA in the oropharynx for at least 5 days suggests that we need better data to determine transmission dynamics and inform our screening practices.\n\nLirong Zou, M.Sc.\nGuangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China\n\nFeng Ruan, M.Med.\nZhuhai Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Zhuhai, China\n\nMingxing Huang, Ph.D.\nFifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, China\n\nLijun Liang, Ph.D.\nGuangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China\n\nHuitao Huang, B.Sc.\nZhuhai Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Zhuhai, China\n\nZhongsi Hong, M.D.\nFifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, China\n\nJianxiang Yu, B.Sc.\nMin Kang, M.Sc.\nYingchao Song, B.Sc.\nGuangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China\n\nJinyu Xia, M.D.\nFifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, China\n\nQianfang Guo, M.Sc.\nTie Song, M.Sc.\nJianfeng He, B.Sc.\nGuangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China\n\nHui-Ling Yen, Ph.D.\nMalik Peiris, Ph.D.\nUniversity of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China\n\nJie Wu, Ph.D.\nGuangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China\n\n\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.105...ibs4lO3KuZXuak",

As of February 14, 2020, 51,986 confirmed cases (including laboratory-confirmed cases and clinically-confirmed cases) were reported in Hubei Province, and 1,318 of them died. Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are considered to be the most important routes of transmission of 2019-nCoV, but do not fully account for the occurrence of all coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, previously known as novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), and the reasons for the rapid spread of this virus (1).\n\nIn Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) Laboratory of the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Vero cells were used for viral isolation from stool samples of COVID-19 patients sent by Heilongjiang CDC. A 2019-nCoV strain was isolated from a stool specimen of a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 severe pneumonia case, who experienced onset on January 16, 2020 and was sampled on February 1, 2020. The interval between sampling and onset was 15 days. The full-length genome sequence indicated that the virus had high-nucleotide similarity (99.98%) to that of the first isolated novel coronavirus isolated from Wuhan, China (Figure 1). In the Vero cells, viral particles with typical morphology of a coronavirus could be observed under the electron microscope (Figure 2).\n\nThese results confirm that COVID-19 patients have live virus in stool specimens, which is a new finding in the transmission routes of 2019-nCoV. In addition to close contact and contact with respiratory secretions of patients, the virus can also be transmitted through the potential fecal-oral route. This means that stool samples may contaminate hands, food, water, etc., and may cause infection by invading the oral cavity, respiratory mucosa, conjunctiva, etc. This virus has many routes of transmission, which can partially explain its strong transmission and fast transmission speed. This study also verified that the nucleic acids of 2019-nCoV can be detected from stool samples (2).\n\nThis finding has important public health significance. Suggestions to strengthen the control of fecal oral transmission of 2019-nCoV include strengthening health publicity and education; maintaining environmental health and personal hygiene; drinking boiled water, avoiding raw food consumption, and implementing separate meal systems in epidemic areas; frequently washing hands and disinfecting of surfaces of objects in households, toilets, public places, and transportation vehicles; and disinfecting the excreta and environment of patients in medical facilities to prevent water and food contamination from patients\u2019 stool samples.\n\nOnline Date: February 15 2020",

We conducted a prospective study to assess long-term clinical, pulmonary function testing, and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging findings after patients were discharged from hospital.\nMethods  A(H7N9) survivors in five provinces and one municipality underwent follow-up visits from August 2013 to September 2018, at three, six, and 12 months after illness onset, and a subset was also assessed at 18 and 64 months after onset. Thirteen patients were enrolled from the first A(H7N9) epidemic in 2013, 36 from the 2013-2014 second epidemic, and 12 from the 2016-2017 fifth epidemic. At each visit, A(H7N9) survivors received a medical examination, including the mMRC (modified Medical Research Council) dyspnea scale assessment, chest auscultation, pulmonary function testing and chest CT scans.\nFindings  The median age of 61 A(H7N9) survivors was 50 years. The cumulative rate of pulmonary dysfunction was 38\u00b75% and 78\u00b72% for chest CT scan abnormalities at the end of follow-up. Restrictive ventilation dysfunction was common during follow-up. Mild dyspnea was documented at three to 12-month follow-up visits.\nInterpretation  Patients who survived severe illness from A(H7N9) virus infection had evidence of persistent lung damage and long-term pulmonary dysfunction.\nFunding  National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (grant number 81525023); Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader (grant number 18XD1400300); National Science and Technology Major Project of China (grant numbers 2017ZX10103009-005, 2018ZX10201001-010).\n\nfull article\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/e...026-2/fulltext",

Potent binding of 2019 novel coronavirus spike protein by a SARS coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody.Tian X1, Li C1, Huang A1, Xia S1, Lu S1, Shi Z2, Lu L1, Jiang S1, Yang Z3, Wu Y1, Ying T1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   The newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused more than 11,900 laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 259 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health. Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  2019-nCoV; ACE2; RBD; SARS-CoV; monoclonal antibody\n\n PMID: \t32065055 \tDOI: \t10.1080/22221751.2020.1729069",

It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral-fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral-fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology. Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed through multiple routes.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  2019-nCoV; Wuhan pneumonia; epidemiology; intestine; swabs\n\n PMID: \t32065057 \tDOI: \t10.1080/22221751.2020.1729071",

The aims of this study were to identify the epidemiological and aetiological characteristics of influenza and establish seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models for forecasting the percentage of visits for influenza-like illness (ILI%) in urban and rural areas of Shenyang. Influenza surveillance data were obtained for ILI cases and influenza virus positivity from 18 sentinel hospitals. The SARIMA models were constructed to predict ILI% for January-December 2019. During 2010-2018, the influenza activity was higher in urban than in rural areas. The age distribution of ILI cases showed the highest rate in young children aged 0-4 years. Seasonal A/H3N2, influenza B virus and pandemic A/H1N1 continuously co-circulated in winter and spring seasons. In addition, the SARIMA (0, 1, 0) (0, 1, 2)12 model for the urban area and the SARIMA (1, 1, 1) (1, 1, 0)12 model for the rural area were appropriate for predicting influenza incidence. Our findings suggested that there were regional and seasonal distinctions of ILI activity in Shenyang. A co-epidemic pattern of influenza strains was evident in terms of seasonal influenza activity. Young children were more susceptible to influenza virus infection than adults. These results provide a reference for future influenza prevention and control strategies in the study area.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Influenza strains; influenza-like illness; seasonal distinctions; surveillance\n\n PMID: \t32054544 \tDOI: \t10.1017/S0950268820000151",

Here, we genetically characterized an influenza A H3N2 isolate (A/swine/P17-4/2017). BLASTN analysis of the 8 gene sequences revealed a high degree of nucleotide similarity (97.0 to 99.0%) to porcine strains circulating in the Republic of Korea and the United States. Specifically, we found a high degree of similarity in the nucleotide matrix gene to those of recent isolates from North Carolina. Therefore, continuous epidemiological surveillance is necessary to monitor the variation and evolution of influenza A viruses.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Noh et al.\n\n\n PMID: \t32054707 \tDOI: \t10.1128/MRA.01355-19 \n  Free full text",

Waterfowl occurrence and residence time as indicators of H5 and H7 avian influenza in North American Poultry.Humphreys JM1,2, Ramey AM3, Douglas DC3, Mullinax JM4, Soos C5, Link P6, Walther P7, Prosser DJ8.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Avian influenza (AI) affects wild aquatic birds and poses hazards to human health, food security, and wildlife conservation globally. Accordingly, there is a recognized need for new methods and tools to help quantify the dynamic interaction between wild bird hosts and commercial poultry. Using satellite-marked waterfowl, we applied Bayesian joint hierarchical modeling to concurrently model species distributions, residency times, migration timing, and disease occurrence probability under an integrated animal movement and disease distribution modeling framework. Our results indicate that migratory waterfowl are positively related to AI occurrence over North America such that as waterfowl occurrence probability or residence time increase at a given location, so too does the chance of a commercial poultry AI outbreak. Analyses also suggest that AI occurrence probability is greatest during our observed waterfowl northward migration, and less during the southward migration. Methodologically, we found that when modeling disparate facets of disease systems at the wildlife-agriculture interface, it is essential that multiscale spatial patterns be addressed to avoid mistakenly inferring a disease process or disease-environment relationship from a pattern evaluated at the improper spatial scale. The study offers important insights into migratory waterfowl ecology and AI disease dynamics that aid in better preparing for future outbreaks.\n\n\n PMID: \t32054908 \tDOI: \t10.1038/s41598-020-59077-1 \n  Free full text",

Patients were screened for picornavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, parainfluenza virus, and influenza, by PCR on nasopharyngeal samples. We excluded patients coinfected with NIRV and influenza.\nRESULTS:  Among 1421 patients enrolled, influenza virus was detected in 535 (38%), and NIRV in 215 (15%), mostly picornavirus (n\u2009=\u200961), RSV (n\u2009=\u200953), coronavirus 229E (n\u2009=\u200948), and human metapneumovirus (n\u2009=\u200940). In-hospital mortality was 5% (NIRV), 4% (influenza), and 5% (no respiratory virus). As compared to influenza, NIRV were associated with age (median, 73 years vs. 68, P\u2009=\u20090.026), chronic respiratory diseases (53% vs. 45%, P\u2009=\u20090.034), cancer (14% vs. 9%, P\u2009=\u20090.029), and immunosuppressive drugs (21% vs. 14%, P\u2009=\u20090.028), and inversely associated with diabetes (18% vs. 25%, P\u2009=\u20090.038). On multivariable analysis, only chronic respiratory diseases (OR 1.5 [1.1-2.0], P\u2009=\u20090.008), and diabetes (OR 0.5 [0.4-0.8], P\u2009=\u20090.01) were associated with NIRV detection.\nCONCLUSIONS:  NIRV are common in adults admitted with ILI during influenza seasons.

Transmission dynamics between infected waterfowl and terrestrial poultry: Differences between the transmission and tropism of H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (clade 2.3.4.4a) among ducks, chickens and turkeys.Puranik A1, Slomka MJ2, Warren CJ1, Thomas SS1, Mahmood S1, Byrne AMP1, Ramsay AM1, Skinner P1, Watson S3, Everett HE1, N\u00fa\u00f1ez A4, Brown IH1, Brookes SM1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   H5N8 highly-pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs, clade 2.3.4.4) have spread globally via migratory waterfowl. Pekin ducks infected with a UK virus (H5N8-2014) served as the donors of infection in three separate cohousing experiments to attempt onward transmission chains to sequentially introduced groups of contact ducks, chickens and turkeys. Efficient transmission occurred among ducks and turkeys up to the third contact stage, with all (100%) birds becoming infected. Introduction of an additional fourth contact group of ducks to the turkey transmission chain demonstrated retention of H5N8-2014's waterfowl-competent adaptation. However, onward transmission ceased in chickens at the second contact stage where only 13% became infected. Analysis of viral progeny at this contact stage revealed no emergent polymorphisms in the intra-species (duck) transmission chain, but both terrestrial species included changes in the polymerase and accessory genes. Typical HPAIV pathogenesis and mortality occurred in infected chickens and turkeys, contrasting with 5% mortality among ducks.\n  Crown Copyright \u00a9 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.

[Epub ahead of print]  SPINT2 inhibits proteases involved in activation of both influenza viruses and metapneumoviruses.Straus MR1, Kinder JT2, Segall M3, Dutch RE4, Whittaker GR5.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Viruses possessing class I fusion proteins require proteolytic activation by host cell proteases to mediate fusion with the host cell membrane. The mammalian SPINT2 gene encodes a protease inhibitor that targets trypsin-like serine proteases. Here we show the protease inhibitor, SPINT2, restricts cleavage-activation efficiently for a range of influenza viruses and for human metapneumovirus (HMPV). SPINT2 treatment resulted in the cleavage and fusion inhibition of full-length influenza A/CA/04/09 (H1N1) HA, A/Aichi/68 (H3N2) HA, A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) HA and HMPV F when activated by trypsin, recombinant matriptase or KLK5. We also demonstrate that SPINT2 was able to reduce viral growth of influenza A/CA/04/09 H1N1 and A/X31 H3N2 in cell culture by inhibiting matriptase or TMPRSS2. Moreover, inhibition efficacy did not differ whether SPINT2 was added at the time of infection or 24 h post-infection. Our data suggest that the SPINT2 inhibitor has a strong potential to serve as a novel broad-spectrum antiviral.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Whole genome sequences were generated from these specimens by next-generation sequencing for phylogenetic characterization and screening for mammalian-adaptive mutations.\nRESULTS:  Human respiratory samples from 74 individuals meeting our case definition, all tested negative for avian influenza A(H5) by real-time PCR, but 2 (3%) were positive for human influenza A(H3N2). 54% (40/74) reported wearing personal protective equipment including overalls, boots, gloves, masks, and goggles. 94% (59/63) of veterinary specimens positive for H5N8 were detected on an influenza A(H5) assay for human diagnostics. A commercial H5N8 assay detected H5 in only 6% (3/48) and N8 in 92% (44/48). Thirteen (13/25; 52%) A(H5N8) genomes generated from veterinary specimens clustered in a single monophyletic clade. These sequences contained the NS (P42S) and PB2 (L89V) mutations noted as markers of mammalian adaptation.\nCONCLUSIONS:  Diagnostic assays were able to detect and characterize influenza A(H5N8) viruses, but poor performance is reported for a commercial assay. Absence of influenza A(H5N8) in humans with occupational exposure and no clear impression of molecular adaptation for mammalian infection suggest that this avian pathogen continues to be low-risk human pathogen.\n  \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

Diversity of Th1/Th2 immunity in mice with acute lung injury induced by the H1N1 influenza virus and lipopolysaccharides.Liu JX1, Zhang Y2, An M3, Wu QG4, Zhao Y5, Li X6, Li G7.\nAuthor informationAbstract INTRODUCTION:  The polarization of T helper (Th) cells plays an important role in the inflammatory response, pathogen removal, and tissue damage processes of infectious acute lung injury (ALI). However, Th cell polarization in viral- or bacterial-mediated ALI is not well defined. Herein, an influenza virus (A/FM/1/47, H1N1) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were chosen to induce ALI in mice, and the resultant diversity of Th-cell polarization was explored.\nMETHODOLOGY:  BALB/c mice were challenged intranasally with the influenza virus or LPS. Edema of the lung, infiltration of inflammatory cells (macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes), oxidative stress, and signature cytokines of Th1 and Th2 cells were detected at 2 days post virus or LPS challenge.\nRESULTS:  The mice exhibited increased capillary permeability accompanied by lung edema and protein-rich alveolar exudation after virus or LPS challenge. Additionally, excessive infiltration of inflammatory cells, robust oxidative stress, and cytokine production were observed in both mouse groups. However, there was conspicuous disparity in the inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokines between the virus- and LPS-challenged mice, where the infiltration in virus-challenged mice was mainly of macrophages and accompanied by robust Th1 cytokine elevation, whereas the infiltration in LPS-challenged mice was primarily of neutrophils and accompanied by robust Th2 cytokine elevation.\nCONCLUSIONS:  The Th cell polarization was skewed depending on whether ALI was induced by the influenza virus or LPS. The polarization in the virus-challenged mice was primarily toward a Th1 response, whereas that in the LPS-challenged mice was mainly toward Th2.\n  Copyright (c) 2019 Jian-xing Liu, Ying Zhang, Miao An, Qing-guang Wu, Ya Zhao, Xiong Li, Geng Li.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Th1/Th2; acute lung injury; infection; inflammation; polarization\n\n PMID: \t32058989 \tDOI: \t10.3855/jidc.10338 \n  Free full text",

Distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was applied to estimate the non-linear and delayed effects of absolute humidity (AH) on P&I mortality. Then, attributable deaths were calculated for the dry and moist AH, defined as AH below and above the minimum mortality AH (MMAH), respectively. Moderate and extreme AHs were defined using cutoffs at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of AH.\nRESULTS:  The relationship between AH and P&I mortality was a U-shaped curve. The MMAH was 11.5 g/m3 (46.4th percentile). In total, 25.7% (95% confidence interval: 10.0-38.2) of P&I mortality (4673 deaths) was attributed to non-optimum AHs. Low AHs were responsible for 12.7% of the P&I death burden (95%CI: 0.2-20.1), while high AHs for 13.0% (95%CI: -9.4-25.7). Extreme low and high AHs accounted for 3.7% (95%CI: 0.1-6.8) and 3.0% (95%CI: 0-5.4) of P&I mortality.\nCONCLUSIONS:  Our study showed that both low AHs and high AHs are responsible for considerable AH-related P&I mortality burden among elderly people. Our results may have important public health implications for the development of relevant intervention policies to reduce P&I deaths among the elderly.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2018.

Genetic Characterization of Avian Influenza A (H11N9) Virus Isolated from Mandarin Ducks in South Korea in 2018.Tuong HT1, Nguyen NM1, Sung HW2, Park H1, Yeo SJ1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   In July 2018, a novel avian influenza virus (A/Mandarin duck/South Korea/KNU18-12/2018(H11N9)) was isolated from Mandarin ducks in South Korea. Phylogenetic and molecular analyses were conducted to characterize the genetic origins of the H11N9 strain. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that eight gene segments of strain H11N9 belonged to the Eurasian lineages. Analysis of nucleotide sequence similarity of both the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes revealed the highest homology with A/duck/Kagoshima/KU57/2014 (H11N9), showing 97.70% and 98.00% nucleotide identities, respectively. Additionally, internal genes showed homology higher than 98% compared to those of other isolates derived from duck and wild birds. Both the polymerase acidic (PA) and polymerase basic 1 (PB1) genes were close to the H5N3 strain isolated in China; whereas, other internal genes were closely related to that of avian influenza virus in Japan. A single basic amino acid at the HA cleavage site (PAIASR\u2193GLF), the lack of a five-amino acid deletion (residue 69-73) in the stalk region of the NA gene, and E627 in the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) gene indicated that the A/Mandarin duck/South Korea/KNU18-12/2018(H11N9) isolate was a typical low-pathogenicity avian influenza. In vitro viral replication of H11N9 showed a lower titer than H1N1 and higher than H9N2. In mice, H11N9 showed lower adaptation than H1N1. The novel A/Mandarin duck/South Korea/KNU18-12/2018(H11N9) isolate may have resulted from an unknown reassortment through the import of multiple wild birds in Japan and Korea in approximately 2016-2017, evolving to produce a different H11N9 compared to the previous H11N9 in Korea (2016). Further reassortment events of this virus occurred in PB1 and PA in China-derived strains. These results indicate that Japanese- and Chinese-derived avian influenza contributes to the genetic diversity of A/Mandarin duck/South Korea/KNU18-12/2018(H11N9) in Korea.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  H11N9; Japan; Mandarin duck; South Korea; novel avian influenza virus isolate\n\n PMID: \t32059510 \tDOI: \t10.3390/v12020203 \n  Free full text",

The identification of molecular signatures provides a mechanism to understand the drivers of vaccine-induced immunity. Most previously reported molecular signatures of human influenza vaccination were derived from a single age group or season, ignoring the effects of immunosenescence or vaccine composition. Thus, it remains unclear how immune signatures of vaccine response change with age across multiple seasons. In this study we profile the transcriptional landscape of young and older adults over five consecutive vaccination seasons to identify shared signatures of vaccine response as well as marked seasonal differences. Along with substantial variability in vaccine-induced signatures across seasons, we uncovered a common transcriptional signature 28 days postvaccination in both young and older adults. However, gene expression patterns associated with vaccine-induced Ab responses were distinct in young and older adults; for example, increased expression of killer cell lectin-like receptor B1 (KLRB1; CD161) 28 days postvaccination positively and negatively predicted vaccine-induced Ab responses in young and older adults, respectively. These findings contribute new insights for developing more effective influenza vaccines, particularly in older adults.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.\n\n\n PMID: \t32060136 \tDOI: \t10.4049/jimmunol.1900922",

[Epub ahead of print]  Next-generation influenza vaccines: opportunities and challenges.Wei CJ1, Crank MC2, Shiver J3, Graham BS2, Mascola JR2, Nabel GJ4.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Seasonal influenza vaccines lack efficacy against drifted or pandemic influenza strains. Developing improved vaccines that elicit broader immunity remains a public health priority. Immune responses to current vaccines focus on the haemagglutinin head domain, whereas next-generation vaccines target less variable virus structures, including the haemagglutinin stem. Strategies employed to improve vaccine efficacy involve using structure-based design and nanoparticle display to optimize the antigenicity and immunogenicity of target antigens; increasing the antigen dose; using novel adjuvants; stimulating cellular immunity; and targeting other viral proteins, including neuraminidase, matrix protein 2 or nucleoprotein. Improved understanding of influenza antigen structure and immunobiology is advancing novel vaccine candidates into human trials.\n\n\n PMID: \t32060419 \tDOI: \t10.1038/s41573-019-0056-x",

We applied a regression discontinuity design to estimate the intention-to-treat effect of the personal invitation for a free influenza vaccination sent to every Dutch inhabitant at age 65 years on each of the outcomes, separately in influenza-epidemic and non-epidemic months.\nRESULTS:  Invitation receipt for free influenza vaccination at age 65 led to a 9.8 percentage points [95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.5 to16.1; P\u2009<\u20090.01] rise in influenza vaccination. During influenza-epidemic months, it was associated with 1.5 fewer influenza/pneumonia deaths per 100\u2009000 individuals (95% CI = -3.1 to -0.0; P\u2009=\u20090.05), a 15 percentage point lower probability to use prescribed medicines (95% CI = -28 to -3; P\u2009=\u20090.02) and 0.13 fewer General Practitioner (GP) visits per month (95% CI = -0.28 to 0.02; P\u2009=\u20090.09), while the association with hospitalizations due to influenza/pneumonia was small and imprecisely estimated (seven more hospitalizations per 100\u2009000 individuals, 95% CI = -20 to 33; P\u2009=\u20090.63). No associations were found with any outcomes during non-epidemic months.\nCONCLUSIONS:  Personal invitations for a free influenza vaccination sent to every Dutch inhabitant at age 65 took pressure off primary health care but had small effects on hospitalizations and mortality.\n  \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

One of these pandemics occurred in Mexico in 2009. Despite the impact of IAV on human health, there is no effective vaccine. Gene mutations and translocation of genome segments of different IAV subtypes infecting a single host cell make the development of a universal vaccine difficult. The design of immunogenic peptides using bioinformatics tools could be an interesting strategy to increase the success of vaccines. In this work, we used the predicted amino acid sequences of the neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA) proteins of different IAV subtypes to perform multiple alignments, epitope predictions, molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental validation. Peptide selection was based on the following criteria: promiscuity, protein surface exposure, and the degree of conservation among different medically relevant IAV strains. These peptides were tested using immunological assays to test their ability to induce production of antibodies against IAV. We immunized rabbits and mice and measured the levels of IgG and IgA antibodies in serum samples and nasal washes. Rabbit antibodies against the peptides P11 and P14 (both of which are hybrids of NA and HA) recognized HA from both group 1 (H1, H2, and H5) and group 2 (H3 and H7) IAV and also recognized the purified NA protein from the viral stock (influenza A Puerto Rico/916/34). IgG antibodies from rabbits immunized with P11 and P14 were capable of recognizing viral particles and inhibited virus hemagglutination. Additionally, intranasal immunization of mice with P11 and P14 induced specific IgG and IgA antibodies in serum and nasal mucosa, respectively. Interestingly, the IgG antibodies were found to have neutralizing capability. In conclusion, the peptides designed through in silico studies were validated in experimental assays.\n\n\n PMID: \t32060794 \tDOI: \t10.1007/s00705-020-04537-2",

Methods: Literature retrieval of case-control studies on the effectiveness of LAIV against seasonal influenza in children published from January 2003 to November 2018 was conducted through Web of Science, PubMed, and ScienceDirect databases. The Stata 13.1 software was used for Meta-analysis. Results: A total of 14 studies were included in this study, and all were test-negative design (TND) studies. Our Meta-analysis showed that the effectiveness of LAIV in children was 49% (95%CI: 40%-57%). Subgroup analysis found that the protection rate of LAIV was 35% against influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 (95%CI: 5%-56%), 35% against influenza A (H3N2) (95%CI: 21%-46%), and 71% against influenza B (95%CI: 55%-82%). The protection rates of trivalent LAIV and quadrivalent LAIV in children were 56% (95%CI: 48%-63%) and 44% (95%CI: 27%-57%), respectively. The protection rates of LAIV in Europe and North America were 65% (95%CI: 47%-77%) and 46% (95%CI: 36%-55%), respectively. Conclusion: LAIV has a certain preventive effect on seasonal influenza in children aged 2-17 years.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Children; Live attenuated influenza vaccine; Meta-analysis; Seasonal influenza; Vaccine effectiveness\n\n PMID: \t32062951 \tDOI: \t10.3760/cma.j.issn.0254-6450.2020.01.019",

Our purpose is to evaluate risk of urticaria in geriatric stroke patients received influenza vaccination (IV).\nMethods:  In a cohort of 192,728 patients with newly diagnosed stroke aged over 65 years obtained from 23 million people in Taiwan's National Health Insurance between 2000 and 2008, we identified 9890 stroke patients who received IV and 9890 propensity score-matched stroke patients who did not receive IV. Controlling for immortal time bias, both the IV and non-IV groups were followed for one year. Urticaria events were identified during the follow-up period. We calculated the adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the one-year risk of urticaria associated with IV.\nResults:  During the follow-up period of one year, stroke patients with IV had a significantly higher risk of urticaria compared with non-IV stroke patients (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.47-2.23). An increased risk of urticaria in stroke patients with IV was noted in both sexes, patients 65-84 years of age, patients with comorbid medical conditions, and various time intervals of follow-up. Vaccinated stroke patients with hemorrhage (RR 4.00, 95% CI 1.76-9.10) and those who received intensive care (RR 5.14, 95% CI 2.32-11.4) had a very high risk of urticaria compared with those without IV.\nConclusion:  Receiving IV may be associated with an increased risk of urticaria in stroke patients. We could not infer the causality from the current results because of this study's limitations. Future investigations are needed to evaluate the possible mechanism underlying the association between IV and urticaria.\n  \u00a9 2019 Lam et al.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  influenza vaccination; stroke; urticaria\n\n PMID: \t32063700 \tPMCID: \tPMC6884998 \tDOI: \t10.2147/CIA.S228324",

The inoculated hens showed 58% mortality and a 100% drop in egg production in the second week post inoculation. The high viral loads in the cloacal samples coincided with the period of the positive immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the oviduct, acute peritonitis and time of mortality, suggesting that the replication of H3N1 in the oviduct was a major component of the onset of clinical disease and increased level of excretion of the virus.In the inoculated young birds, the clinical signs were very mild with the exception of one bird. The results suggest that the time of replication of the virus was much shorter than in the adult layers, part of the young males did not show any proof of being infected at all.To conclude, the results of the study in young birds confirmed the intravenous pathogenicity test results but also showed that the clinical signs in adult layers were very severe. Based on the mortality without a bacterial component, complete drop of egg production and post mortem findings, this H3N1 strain is a moderately virulent strain, the highest category for LPAI strains. It is important to realize that if HPAI did not exist, this moderately virulent H3N1 virus would most likely to be considered as a very virulent virus.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  H3N1; SPF layers; low pathogenic avian influenza; mortality; pathogenesis; virulence\n\n PMID: \t32064915 \tDOI: \t10.1080/03079457.2020.1731423",

A Review of Historical Classics, Research Evidence and Current Prevention Programs.Luo H1,2, Tang QL3, Shang YX2,3, Liang SB2,3, Yang M2,3, Robinson N2,4, Liu JP5,6.\nAuthor informationAbstract OBJECTIVE:  Since December 2019, an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to almost all parts of China. This was followed by prevention programs recommending Chinese medicine (CM) for the prevention. In order to provide evidence for CM recommendations, we reviewed ancient classics and human studies.\nMETHODS:  Historical records on prevention and treatment of infections in CM classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, and CM prevention programs issued by health authorities in China since the COVID-19 outbreak were retrieved from different databases and websites till 12 February, 2020. Research evidence included data from clinical trials, cohort or other population studies using CM for preventing contagious respiratory virus diseases.\nRESULTS:  The use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases was traced back to ancient Chinese practice cited in Huangdi's Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) where preventive effects were recorded. There were 3 studies using CM for prevention of SARS and 4 studies for H1N1 influenza. None of the participants who took CM contracted SARS in the 3 studies. The infection rate of H1N1 influenza in the CM group was significantly lower than the non-CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.52; n=4). For prevention of COVID-19, 23 provinces in China issued CM programs. The main principles of CM use were to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness. The most frequently used herbs included Radix astragali (Huangqi), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao).\nCONCLUSIONS:  Based on historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk population. Prospective, rigorous population studies are warranted to confirm the potential preventive effect of CM.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Chinese medicine; clinical evidence; corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19); prevention program; review\n\n PMID: \t32065348 \tDOI: \t10.1007/s11655-020-3192-6",

In this review, with the aim to provide insights into and guidelines for the control of AIV spread in China and globally in the future, we analyzed the reasons why AIV has persisted in China based on socioeconomic features, including poultry biosecurity, live bird markets, live bird transportation, wild birds, poultry waterfowl, poultry density, poultry population, and infected birds. We also described the present status of the AIV subtypes H9, H5, and H7 in China to elucidate the effectiveness of the strategies currently employed in China (i.e., culling, mass vaccination, and biosecurity improvement) to control the disease based on a literature review and our unpublished surveillance data collected over a 12-year period from 2007 to 2018. We then summarized the lessons to be learned from the control experience in China, including whether culling of infected birds is of limited value for disease control and whether improved biosecurity is a better option than culling and vaccination for the long-term control of AIV, and when the vaccine strain should be updated.\n  This article is protected by copyright.

C-reactive protein response to influenza vaccination predicts cardiovascular disease risk in the Philippines.McDade TW1,2, Borja JB3,4, Lee N3,5, Aquino CT6, Barrett T1, Adair LS7, Kuzawa CW1,2.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Inflammation is associated with increased risk for chronic degenerative diseases, as well as age-related functional declines across many systems and tissues. Current understandings of inflammation, aging, and human health are based on studies conducted almost exclusively in high-income nations that rely primarily on baseline measures of chronic inflammation. This analysis investigates the inflammatory response to vaccination as a predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among older women in the Philippines, a lower-middle income nation with rising rates of overweight/obesity and relatively high burdens of infectious disease. Concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured at baseline and 72 h following influenza vaccination in 530 women (mean age = 55.2 years). Ankle-brachial index (ABI) - an indicator of peripheral arterial disease and broader CVD risk - was measured approximately three years later. The magnitude of CRP response to vaccination was positively associated with ABI, indicating that a larger inflammatory response predicts lower CVD risk. Baseline CRP was negatively associated with CRP response to vaccination, and was not associated with ABI independently of CRP response. These results suggest that research across ecological settings, and with more dynamic measures of inflammatory response and regulation, may yield important insights into the associations among inflammation, aging, and disease.\n\n\n PMID: \t32065539 \tDOI: \t10.1080/19485565.2019.1597623",

Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05-0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. As no specific therapies are available for 2019-nCoV, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.\n\n...\nhttps://www.journalofhospitalinfecti...046-3/fulltext",

Lytica's proprietary \"stapling\" technology aims to overcome these hurdles.\n  The company has produced compounds called stapled antimicrobial peptides that have demonstrated potent activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria, stability against degrading, and wide therapeutic potential. If successful, the project could produce treatments for a wide range of serious infections, including lung, urinary tract, and intra-abdominal infections.\n  Since its launch in 2016, CARB-X, a public-private partnership, has announced 57 awards exceeding $193 million, with additional funds possible if project milestones are met. Its goal is to invest $500 million by the end of 2021.\nFeb 18 CARB-X news release\n\nUK report examines airborne antimicrobial resistance  In a report today on airborne antimicrobial resistance, the UK Environment Agency says much more research is needed to determine how much of a health risk it poses.\n  The review and analysis of 88 relevant papers obtained from three academic databases found that, despite differences in study environments, methods used, and antibiotics studied, some basic conclusions emerged. Among those conclusions are that tetracycline resistance appears to be more prevalent in agriculturally associated air, industrial activities involving fecal matter (including farms) are associated with the highest levels of multidrug resistance reported to date, and the ubiquitous use of azole antifungals in medicine and agriculture\u2014along with the ability of fungi to travel long distances in the air\u2014makes airborne antifungal resistance a relevant threat.\n  Some of the questions that still need to be addressed, according to the report, are whether air is a primary route of antimicrobial resistance transmission to humans and other vulnerable hosts, and how the resulting risk compares with other transmission methods. The researchers say exploring the biophysics of airborne antimicrobial resistance could help answer some of these questions.\n  \"More research is recommended to close knowledge gaps and test emergent hypotheses,\" the authors of the report write. \"Also needed is a more concerted effort to report and share the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing in a standardised way, and more careful and standardised collection and reporting of air sampling.\"\nFeb 18 UK Environment Agency report\n\nStudy: In PCV-13 era, new strains of resistant pneumococci emerging  An analysis of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates collected from young children in primary care settings has found reduced susceptibility to several antibiotic classes in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) era, researchers report today in Clinical Infectious Diseases.\n  In the prospective cohort study, investigators from Rochester General Hospital Research Institute in Rochester, New York, collected nasopharyngeal and middle ear fluid samples from children ages 6 to 36 months during acute otitis media (ear infection) and routine healthy visits at primary care pediatric practices in Rochester from 2006 through 2016. They then performed antibiotic susceptibility testing on S pneumoniae isolates against a panel of 16 antibiotics from 10 classes. All children were up to date on vaccines, receiving the PCV-7 vaccine from 2006 until April 2010 and PCV-13 after April 2010.\n  From 2006 through 2016, 1,201 S pneumoniae isolates were characterized from 1,072 visits of 448 children. Analysis of susceptibility trends showed that, after introduction of PCV-13, susceptibility to S pneumoniae to antibiotics, especially penicillin, initially improved, largely because of the disappearance of serotype 19A, which is included in PCV-13. But beginning in 2013, antibiotic susceptibility among S pneumoniae strains began decreasing with the emergence of three serotypes (11A, 35B, and 35F) not included in PCV-13. In addition to reduced susceptibility to penicillin, the most recent isolates also showed reduced susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and carbapenems.\n  The authors of the study say the reduced susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and carbapenems could have implications for future treatment of invasive pneumococcal disease. They also note that neither of the two PCVs in advanced development (PCV-15 and PCV-20) includes serotypes 35B or 35F.\nFeb 18 Clin Infect Dis abstract",

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "By Vincent Racaniello\n\n\n\nThe spike glycoprotein of the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 contains a potential cleavage site for furin proteases. This observation has implications for the zoonotic origin of the virus and its epidemic spread in China.\n\nThe membrane of coronaviruses harbors a trimeric transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein (pictured) which is essential for entry of virus particles into the cell. The S protein contains two functional domains: a receptor binding domain, and a second domain which contains sequences that mediate fusion of the viral and cell membranes. The S glycoprotein must be cleaved by cell proteases to enable exposure of the fusion sequences and hence is needed for cell entry.\n\nThe nature of the cell protease that cleaves the S glycoprotein varies according to the coronavirus. The MERS-CoV S glycoprotein contains a furin cleavage site and is probably processed by these intracellular proteases during exit from the cell. The virus particles are therefore ready for entry into the next cell. In contrast, the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is uncleaved upon virus release from cells; it is likely cleaved during virus entry into a cell.\n\nProteolytic cleavage of the S glycoprotein can determine whether the virus can cross species, e.g. from bats to humans. For example, the S glycoprotein from a MERS-like CoV from Ugandan bats can bind to human cells but cannot mediate virus entry. However, if the protease trypsin is included during infection, the S glycoprotein is cleaved and virus entry takes place. This observation demonstrates that cleavage of the S glycoprotein is a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission.\n\nExamination of the protein sequence of the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 reveals the presence of a furin cleavage sequence (PRRARS|V). The CoV with the highest nucleotide sequence homology, isolated from a bat in Yunnan in 2013 (RaTG-13), does not have the furin cleavage sequence. Because furin proteases are abundant in the respiratory tract, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein is cleaved upon exit from epithelial cells and consequently can efficiently infect other cells. In contrast, the highly related bat CoV RaTG-13 does not have the furin cleavage site.\n\nWhether or not the furin cleavage site within the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is actually cleaved remains to be determined. Meanwhile, it is possible that the insertion of a furin cleavage site allowed a bat CoV to gain the ability to infect humans. The furin cleavage site might have been acquired by recombination with another virus possessing that site. This event could have happened thousands of years ago, or weeks ago. Upon introduction into a human \u2013 likely in an outdoor meat market \u2013 the virus began its epidemic spread.\n\nFurins are also known to control infection by avian influenza A viruses, in which cleavage of the HA glycoprotein is needed for entry into the cell. Low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses contain a single basic amino acid at the cleavage site in the HA protein which is cleaved by proteases that are restricted to the respiratory tract. Insertion of a furin cleavage site in the HA of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses leads to replication in multiple tissues and higher pathogenicity, due to the distribution of furins in multiple tissues.\n\nAcquisition of the furin cleavage site might be viewed as a \u2018gain of function\u2019 that enabled a bat CoV to jump into humans and begin its current epidemic spread.\n\nhttp://www.virology.ws/2020/02/13/fu...-glycoprotein/",

It reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice.\nAbstractInfo/HistoryMetrics Preview PDF\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Since the first cluster of cases was identified in Wuhan City, China, in December, 2019, 2019-nCoV has rapidly spread across China as well as caused multiple introductions in 25 countries as of February, 2020. Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently more evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of emerging disease. The present study aimed to estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of 2019-nCov in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics.\n\nMethods: We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For estimation, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed nCov cases and deaths in Wuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were used.\n\nResults: We found that our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China in 2019-2020 is calculated to be as high as 7.05 (95%CrI: 6.11-8.18) and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23rd in 2020 has declined R to 3.24 (95%CrI: 3.16-3.32), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 983006 (95%CrI: 759475-1296258) in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 9.8% (95%CrI: 7.6-13.0%). We also found that most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be 0.07% (95% CrI: 0.05%-0.09%) and 0.23% (95%CrI: 0.17-0.30%), which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR at 4.06% Conclusions: We have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of 2019-nCov in Wuhan, China, 2019-2020 using an ecological modelling approach. The power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems.\n\n...\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1....12.20022434v1",

First, under Article 43.2, countries cannot implement additional health measures exclusively as a precaution but must rather ground their decision making in \u201cscientific principles\u201d, \u201cscientific evidence\u201d, and \u201cadvice from WHO\u201d. 1\n Many of the travel restrictions being implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak are not supported by science or WHO. Travel restrictions for these kinds of viruses have been challenged by public health researchers,  4\n, 5\n, 6\n and WHO has advised against travel restrictions, arguing they cause more harm than good.  7\n, 8\n\n\nSecond, under Article 43.1 any additional health measures implemented by countries \u201cshall not be more restrictive of international traffic and not more invasive or intrusive to persons than reasonably available alternatives\u201d. 1\n In this case, even if travel restrictions did work, there are so many other more effective measures that countries can take to protect their citizens. WHO has issued COVID-19 technical guidance on several such measures, including risk communication, surveillance, patient management, and screening at ports of entry and exit.  9\n\n\nThird, and most importantly, Article 3.1 strictly requires all additional health measures to be implemented \u201cwith full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons\u201d, 1\n which in turn must reflect the international law principles of necessity, legitimacy, and proportionality that govern limitations to and derogations from rights and freedoms.  10\n Under no circumstances should public health or foreign policy decisions be based on the racism and xenophobia that are now being directed at Chinese people and those of Asian descent.  11\n\n\nMany of the travel restrictions implemented by dozens of countries during the COVID-19 outbreak are therefore violations of the IHR. 12\n Yet, perhaps even more troubling, is that at least two-thirds of these countries have not reported their additional health measures to WHO,  12\n which is a further violation of IHR Articles 43.3 and 43.5. Flagrant disregard for the legal requirement to promptly report any additional health measures frustrates WHO's ability to coordinate the world's response to public health emergencies and prevents countries from holding each other accountable for their obligations under the IHR.\n\nSome countries argue that they would rather be safe than sorry. But evidence belies the claim that illegal travel restrictions make countries safer. 4\n, 5\n, 6\n In the short term, travel restrictions prevent supplies from getting into affected areas, slow down the international public health response, stigmatise entire populations, and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us. In the longer term, countries selecting which international laws to follow encourages other countries to do the same, which in turn undermines the broader rules-based world order. Effective global governance is not possible when countries cannot depend on each other to comply with international agreements.  13\n\n\nOf course, the IHR is far from perfect. For example, the IHR only governs countries, not corporations and other non-governmental actors. Thus, some countries are finding themselves with de-facto travel restrictions when airlines stop flying to places affected by COVID-19. Additionally, the IHR does not have robust accountability mechanisms for compliance, enforcement, oversight, and transparency. 14\n\n\nBut the IHR is the legally binding system for protecting people worldwide from the global spread of disease. With more than 2\u00b75 billion people travelling between about 4000 airports every year, 15\n future outbreaks are inevitable. Responses that are anchored in fear, misinformation, racism, and xenophobia will not save us from outbreaks like COVID-19. Upholding the rule of international law is needed now more than ever. Countries can start by rolling back illegal travel restrictions that have already been implemented and by supporting WHO and each other in implementing the IHR.\n\nThis research was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research ( grant #312902 ) and the International Collaboration for Capitalizing on Cost-Effective and Life-Saving Commodities (i4C) that is funded through the Research Council of Norway's Global Health & Vaccination Programme (GLOBVAC Project #234608).

Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed four large-scale datasets of normal lung tissue to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression. No significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression were found between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in smoker samples compared to non-smoker samples. This indicates the smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and thus smoking history should be considered in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.\n\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1....05.20020107v1",

Of the confirmed cases, 80.9% cases were mild, and the vast majority (86.6%) of confirmed cases were in people ages 30 to 79 years old.\n  About 14% of the illnesses were severe, which included pneumonia and shortness of breath, and about 5% have critical disease, marked by respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. The overall case fatality rate was 2.3%, and of 1,023 deaths included in the study, the majority were in people age 60 and older or those with underlying medical conditions.\n  Epidemiologic curve analysis shows a common source pattern in December, which shifted to a propagated source pattern starting in early January, which the researchers said might reflect several zoonotic events at the outbreak market in Wuhan. Around Jan 23 to Jan 26, the epidemic peaked and began to decline, according to the data.\n  Though 1,716 healthcare workers were infected in the outbreak, 5 of them fatally, there is no evidence of super-spreader events in healthcare facilities caring for COVID-19 cases, the group wrote. Those events were hallmarks of outbreaks involving severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). So far, it's not clear if the difference is due to the virus or prevention tactics, they noted.\n  China's massive control measures, which started on Jan 23 with limiting travel in and out of Wuhan, slowed China's epidemic and its spread to the rest of the world, the authors note. But they warn that officials need to prepare for the epidemic to rebound when huge numbers of people in China return to work and school.\nCaution urged in interpreting outbreak decline  At a media telebriefing today, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said the new data from China gives health officials a better understanding about the affected age range, the severity of the disease, and the mortality rate, which he said helps the WHO deliver evidence-based guidance to countries.\n  However, he said the report's indication of a decline in cases should be interpreted with caution. \"Trends can change as new populations are affected,\" he said. \"It's too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table.\"\n  Tedros said relatively few cases have been reported in children, but more research is needed to understand why. Though the new report fills in some gaps for understanding the outbreak, others remain. He added that the international expert team is now on the ground in China to answer more questions and to get an even clearer picture of the outbreak.\n  China's National Health Commission today reported 2,048 new cases, a slight increase from the 2,009 it reported yesterday. It also reported 628 fewer severe cases as it adjusts those totals and 105 more deaths. The country's totals now stand at 70,548 cases, 10,644 severe cases, and 1,770 deaths.\nCruise ship cases grow by 99  Japan's health ministry today reported that 99 more people on the Diamond Princess cruise ship have tested positive, raising the total to 454. The ship has been quarantined in Yokohama port since Feb 3.\n  Meanwhile, the US State Department said it evacuated more than 300 US citizens and their family members who had been on the Diamond Princess, and all were evaluated by medical officials from the Department of Health and Human Services and deemed asymptomatic and fit to fly.\n  However, between getting off the ship and heading for the airport in Japan, US officials learned that 14 passengers who had been tested 2 or 3 days earlier were positive for COVID-19. They were moved to a specialized part of the aircraft and isolated according to standard protocol.\n  The whole group flew back to the United States, with passengers slated to arrive at either Travis Air Force Base in California or Joint Base San Antonio in Texas.\n  In other developments in Japan, the country's health ministry reported two more local cases, one involving a health ministry official who worked as a liaison on the Diamond Princess and the other a nurse who worked at a hospital near Tokyo, where she took care of a woman in her 80s who died from the disease, Kyodo News reported today.\nSingapore, UAE report more cases  Singapore's health ministry today reported 2 more cases, raising its total to 77. The patients include an individual who was evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9 and a person who is a contact of an earlier case.\n  The United Arab Emirates (UAE) health ministry yesterday reported 1 more COVID-19 case, which involves a 37-year-old Chinese man. The infection brings the UAE's total to 9, of whom 3 have recovered and 6 are still receiving treatment, 1 of them in an intensive care unit.\nGene analysis debunks lab-made claims  In a preprint publication yesterday, an international group of virologists detailed the evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is not lab made or artificially manipulated.\n  Based on their analysis of the genome, they described its notable features and scenarios that likely led to its evolution. They proposed two scenarios: natural selection in a host animal before the virus jumped to humans, or natural selection in humans following transmission from animals to people.\n  They also looked at whether selection during passage in culture could have produced the same genetic features they observed.",

National and regional rates of AMU were calculated and analyzed using defined daily doses per 1,000 patient-days (DDD/1,000 pd), and AMU data were used to rank the top antimicrobial agents used individually, by class/subclass, and by year. Overall, 16 to 18 CNISP adult hospitals per year provided data, with representation from 6 sites in western Canada, 15 in central Canada, and 1 in eastern Canada.\n  From 2009 to 2016, the data showed a 12% reduction in total AMU (from 654 to 573 DDD/1,000 pd, P\u2009=\u20090.03). Fluoroquinolones accounted for most of this decrease, with a 47% reduction in combined oral and intravenous use, (from 129 to 68 DDD/1,000 pd, P\u2009<\u20090.002). The top five antimicrobials used in 2016 were cefazolin (78 DDD/1,000 pd), piperacillin-tazobactam (53 DDD/1,000 pd), ceftriaxone (49 DDD/1,000 pd), vancomycin (combined oral and intravenous use: 44 DDD/1,000 pd), and ciprofloxacin (combined oral and intravenous use: 42 DDD/1,000 pd).\n  Among the top 10 antimicrobials used in 2016, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole use decreased significantly between 2009 and 2016, by 46% (P\u2009= 0.002) and 26% (P\u2009=\u20090.002) respectively. Use of ceftriaxone (85% increase, P\u2009=\u20090.0008) and oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (140% increase, P\u2009<\u20090.0001) increased significantly but contributed only a small component (8.6% and 5.0%, respectively) of overall use.\n  The authors of the study say it's unclear whether the reduction in fluoroquinolone use is related to stewardship efforts, warnings of adverse effects associated with fluoroquinolone use in the United States and Canada, or a combination.\nFeb 13 Antimicrob Resist Infect Control study\nElectronic alerts linked to fewer C diff tests, lower rates, review finds  A systematic review of 11 studies indicates that the use of electronic alerts for diagnostic stewardship for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) was associated with reductions in CDI testing, inappropriate CDI testing, and rates of CDI, researchers reported in Clinical Infectious Diseases.\n  The aim of the study was to determine whether CDI testing-oriented electronic alerts, which aim to discourage inappropriate testing and subsequent unnecessary antibiotic treatment, have an effect not just on process indicators, such as laboratory ordering, but also on intermediate outcomes (rates of CDI testing and inappropriate testing) and patient-centered outcomes (rates of CDI).  To answer those questions, the researchers searched six databases for studies evaluating the association between the alerts and CDI testing volume and/or CDI rate.\n  The 11 studies that met the criteria for inclusion varied significantly in alert triggers and study outcomes. Nine studies used an alert discouraging CDI testing when the patient had recent laxative use, 7 used an alert discouraging CDI testing with lack of clinical indication for testing, and 6 used an alert discouraging CDI testing when the patient had recent CDI testing; 11 articles studied the number of tests ordered, 6 studied the number of appropriate tests, and 7 studied the CDI rate.\n  Six of the 11 studies demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in CDI testing volume, 6 of 6 studies evaluating appropriateness of CDI testing found a significant reduction in the proportion of inappropriate testing, and 4 of 7 studies measuring CDI rate demonstrated a significant decrease in the CDI rate in the post- vs pre-intervention periods. The magnitude of the increase in appropriate CDI testing varied, with some studies reporting an increase with minimal clinical significance.\n  The authors of the review note that, while alert-based interventions appeared to be largely successful in achieving the desired changes, most studies included multiple co-interventions, and none were randomized. In addition, they point out that unintended adverse consequences, such as underdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of CDI, and alert fatigue\u2014in which physicians have trouble distinguishing between clinically meaningful and non-meaningful alerts\u2014remain understudied.\nFeb 15 Clin Infect Dis abstract",

The man's contact with camel was unknown, and he was not a healthcare worker. He is listed as a primary case, meaning it is unlikely he contracted the virus from another person.\n  The second case, noted today, occurred in a 40-year-old man from Najran. His case is also listed as primary, and his camel contact status is unknown.\n  Saudi Arabia reported 15 cases in January, including a probable healthcare-related cluster of 6 cases in Abha.\n  The World Health Organization (WHO) said in its latest monthly update that, since 2012, it has received reports of 2,499 MERS-CoV cases, at least 861 of them fatal. The vast majority of these cases were in Saudi Arabia.\nFeb 15 Saudi MOH report\nFeb 17 Saudi MOH report\n\nWHO: 4 African countries license Ebola vaccine  The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Burundi, Ghana, and Zambia have licensed Merck's Ervebo\u2014the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine\u2014according to the WHO.\n  The move allows Merck to stockpile the vaccine and distribute it to countries most at risk of Ebola virus disease outbreaks. Once licensed, the vaccine can be used outside of research protocols and clinical trials.\n  \"The approval of the Ebola vaccine by these countries is another milestone in the fight against this unforgiving disease,\" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, in a news release. \"Africa has rallied to cement hard-fought progress to keep its people safe from Ebola.\"\n  Ervebo has been used on almost 300,000 people in the DRC since August 2018, when the country's current Ebola outbreak began. Preliminary studies suggest the vaccine is 97.5% effective in preventing Ebola transmission. \n  According to the WHO's online Ebola dashboard there have been 3,432 Ebola cases confirmed in the current outbreak, including 2,249 deaths.\nFeb 14 WHO news release\nWHO Ebola dashboard\n\nVietnam confirms 6 new H5N6 avian flu outbreaks  Vietnamese officials confirmed six H5N6 avian flu outbreaks in the northern part of the country, including five in Thanh Hoa province and one in Nghe An province, according to a World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) report today.\n  The outbreaks in Thanh Hoa affected village and backyard flocks ranging in size from 970 to 3,167 poultry, while the one in Nghe An involves a village flock of 161 birds. The outbreaks began on Feb 12 through Feb 14.\n  All told, the virus affected 3,200 poultry, killing 1,750 of them, among 8,087 susceptible birds. Officials are disinfecting the premises and have placed surveillance zones around the outbreak areas. Since Feb 4, Vietnamese veterinary officials have reported 10 other H5N6 outbreaks to the OIE.\nFeb 17 OIE report",

On Twitter, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said, \"We look forward to this vitally important collaboration contributing to global knowledge about the COVID19 outbreak.\"\nDiamond Princess infections reach 355  Yesterday, Japan's health ministry reported 67 new cruise ship infections (38 asymptomatic) and today the agency reported 70 new cases (38 asymptomatic), bringing the total to 355.\n  Meanwhile, a number of countries, including the United States, are evacuating their citizens from the quarantined cruise ship, which has been in Japan's Yokohama port since Feb 3. In a statement yesterday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it was working with the State Department to bring US citizens home on charter flights. There are about 400 Americans on the ship.\n  The returning passengers will be subject to a 14-day quarantine and will be housed at two locations: Travis Air Force Base in California and Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas. Passengers will be screened before leaving Japan to avoid symptomatic people from boarding the plane. Once they return to the United States, the passengers will be housed separately from the evacuees from Hubei province.\n  Meanwhile, an 83-year-old American woman who was on the Westerdam cruise ship and disembarked in Cambodia has tested positive for the virus after arriving in Malaysia, Reuters reported yesterday. She is the first of the boat's passengers to test positive. Cambodia recently allowed the ship to dock after it was turned away by four other countries.\n  The woman initially tested negative in Cambodia, then was positive in a preliminary test in Malaysia. A second test confirmed the finding, according to the report. The test results for the woman's husband were negative. The couple were the only two with symptoms among the 145 ship passengers who entered Malaysia, which has now barred other Westerdam passengers. There are still 236 passengers and 747 crew on the boat.\nSingapore, Japan totals rise  Over the weekend, Singapore and Japan reported more cases, nearly all local, and one of Japan's cases involves a traveler who got sick after arriving home from Hawaii.\n  In health ministry reports yesterday and today, Singapore\u2014which has the most cases outside of China\u2014reported 8 more cases, raising its total to 75.

Three patients are in Wakayama prefecture and appear to be part of a hospital cluster, including the wife of a man who worked at the facility.\n  Two of the people confirmed in Japan over the past few days are a husband and wife who recently vacationed in Japan. The Hawaii Department of Health said in a Feb 14 statement that the man, who was apparently diagnosed first, stayed for a few days in Maui then traveled to Oahu, where he experienced cold-like symptoms without fever.\n  The health department said the man was traveling with his wife and may have worn a mask during parts of his travel and added that he wore a mask during his flight back to Japan. Hawaiian officials are tracing contacts and have alerted health providers to be alert for more cases.\nChina's total grows to 68,500  Over the past 3 days, the number of daily COVID-19 cases reported in China declined, with 5,090 reported Friday, 2,641 yesterday, and 2,009 today. In an update today from the National Health Commission (NHC), the country reported 291 more serious cases and 142 more deaths, raising those respective totals to 11,272 and 1,665.\n  The World Health Organization (WHO) online COVID-19 dashboard shows that, although Hubei province is the main epicenter, four other provinces have more than 1,000 confirmed cases: Guangdong (1,316), Henan (1,231), Zhejiang (1,167), and Hunan (1,004)\n  Hubei province's government today announced new strict measures to curb the spread of the virus, Reuters reported.

And especially my appreciation to my friend Ambassador Ischinger.\n  Yesterday I was in Kinshasa, in the Democratic of the Congo, meeting with the President and other senior ministers to review progress against the Ebola outbreak and work together on a plan to strengthen DRC\u2019s health system so that it never sees another outbreak like this again.\n  I\u2019d like to thank the President for his leadership, and for his vision of a healthier and safer DRC.\n  We are finally starting to see the possibility of ending this outbreak, after more than 18 months and the loss of 2,249 lives. In the past week there has been just 1 case of Ebola, compared with 120 cases a week at the peak in April.\n  This epidemic stands in stark contrast to the previous Ebola outbreak in the western part of DRC in 2018, an area that is relatively stable and peaceful. That outbreak was controlled in just three months.\n  This experience illustrates a key lesson of history: disease and insecurity are old friends.\n  It was no coincidence that the 1918 flu pandemic erupted in the middle of the First World War, and killed more people than the First World War itself.\n  It\u2019s no coincidence that the final frontier for eradicating polio is in the most insecure regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n  It\u2019s no coincidence that Ebola has spread in the most insecure region of the DRC.\n  Without peace, health can be an unattainable dream.\n  But the opposite can also be true: epidemics have the potential to cause severe political, economic and social instability and insecurity.\n  Health security is therefore not just the health sector\u2019s business. It\u2019s everybody\u2019s business.\n  There are three main scenarios in which a coordinated response between the health and security sectors is essential:\n  First, high-impact epidemics in situations of conflict and insecurity, such as Ebola. In the last few years, 80% of outbreaks requiring an international response have occurred in countries affected by fragility, conflict and insecurity.\n  Second, the emergence of a pathogen with pandemic potential, moving rapidly from country to country and requiring an immediate and large-scale response in countries.\n  And third, the deliberate or accidental release of biological agents \u2013 a hopefully rare event for which we must nonetheless be prepared.\n  The second of these three scenarios is what we are seeing now with the outbreak of COVID-19.\n  Although PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern) is declared, with 99% of cases in China, this is still very much an emergency for that country. Because in the rest of the world we only have 505 cases and in China we have more than 66,000 cases.\n  Let me be clear: it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take.\n  What I can tell you is what encourages us, and what concerns us.\n  We are encouraged that the steps China has taken to contain the outbreak at its source appear to have bought the world time, even though those steps have come at greater cost to China itself. But it\u2019s slowing the spread to the rest of the world.\n  We\u2019re encouraged that outside China, we have not yet seen widespread community transmission.\n  We\u2019re encouraged that the global research community has come together to identify and accelerate the most urgent research needs for diagnostics, treatments and vaccines.\n  We\u2019re encouraged that we have been able to ship diagnostic kits, as well as supplies of masks, gloves, gowns and other personal protective equipment to some of the countries that need it most.\n  We\u2019re encouraged that an international team of experts is now on the ground in China, working closely with their Chinese counterparts to understand the outbreak, and to inform the next steps in the global response.\n  But we also have concerns.\n  We\u2019re concerned by the continued increase in the number of cases in China.\n  We\u2019re concerned by reports from China yesterday of the number of health workers who have been infected or have died.\n  We\u2019re concerned by the lack of urgency in funding the response from the international community.\n  We\u2019re concerned about the severe disruption in the market for personal protective equipment, which is putting front line health workers and carers at risk.\n  We\u2019re concerned about the levels of rumours and misinformation that are hampering the response.\n  And most of all, we\u2019re concerned about the potential havoc this virus could wreak in countries with weaker health systems.\n  The outbreaks of Ebola and COVID-19 underscore once again the vital importance for all countries to invest in preparedness and not panic.\n  Two years ago, WHO and the World Bank founded the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, an independent body to assess the state of the world\u2019s readiness for a pandemic. My sister Gro Bruntland, the co-chair of the Board, is actually here.\n  Last year the board published its first report, which concluded the world remains badly prepared.\n  For too long, the world has operated on a cycle of panic and neglect. We throw money at an outbreak, and when it\u2019s over, we forget about it and do nothing to prevent the next one.\n  The world spends billions of dollars preparing for a terrorist attack, but relatively little preparing for the attack of a virus, which could be far more deadly and far more damaging economically, politically and socially.\n  This is frankly difficult to understand, and dangerously short-sighted.\n  ===\n  Today, I have three requests for the international community.\n  First, we must use the window of opportunity we have to intensify our preparedness.\n  China has bought the world time. We don\u2019t know how much time.\n  All countries must be prepared for the arrival of cases, to treat patients with dignity and compassion, to prevent onward transmission, and to protect health workers.\n  WHO is working with manufacturers and distributors of personal protective equipment to ensure a reliable supply of the tools health workers need to do their job safely and effectively.\n  But we\u2019re not just fighting an epidemic; we\u2019re fighting an infodemic.\n  Fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus, and is just as dangerous.\n  That\u2019s why we\u2019re also working with search and media companies like Facebook, Google, Pinterest, Tencent, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube and others to counter the spread of rumours and misinformation.\n  We call on all governments, companies and news organizations to work with us to sound the appropriate level of alarm, without fanning the flames of hysteria.\n  Second, this is not a job for health ministers alone. It takes a whole-of-government approach.\n  But that approach must be coherent and coordinated, guided by evidence and public health priorities.\n  In many countries, measures have been taken by one part of government without appropriate consultation with the health ministry, or consideration of the impact of these measures.\n  Now more than ever is the time for us to let science and evidence lead policy.\n  If we don\u2019t, we are headed down a dark path that leads nowhere but division and disharmony.\n  And third, we must be guided by solidarity, not stigma. I repeat this: we must be guided by solidarity, not stigma.\n  The greatest enemy we face is not the virus itself; it\u2019s the stigma that turns us against each other. We must stop stigma and hate!\n  [Applause]\n  Much has been written and said about my praise for China.\n  I have given credit where it\u2019s due, and I will continue to do that, as I would and I did for any country that fights an outbreak aggressively at its source to protect its own people and the people of the world, even at great cost to itself.\n  It\u2019s easy to blame. It\u2019s easy to politicize. It\u2019s harder to tackle a problem together, and find solutions together.\n  We will all learn lessons from this outbreak. But now is not the time for recriminations or politicization.\n  We have a choice. Can we come together to face a common and dangerous enemy? Or will we allow fear, suspicion and irrationality to distract and divide us?\n  In our fractured and divided world, health is one of the few areas in which international cooperation offers the opportunity for countries to work together for a common cause.\n  This is a time for facts, not fear.\n  This is a time for rationality, not rumours.\n  This is a time for solidarity, not stigma. \n  I thank you.",

ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) has been shown to be one of the major receptors that mediate the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells, which also happens in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Several researches have indicated that some patients have abnormal renal function or even kidney damage in addition to injury in respiratory system, and the related mechanism is unknown. This arouses our interest in whether coronavirus infection will affect the urinary and male reproductive systems. Here in this study, we used the online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs. The results indicate that ACE2 highly expresses in renal tubular cells, Leydig cells and cells in seminiferous ducts in testis. Therefore, virus might directly bind to such ACE2 positive cells and damage the kidney and testicular tissue of patients. Our results indicate that renal function evaluation and special care should be performed in 2019-nCoV patients during clinical work, because of the kidney damage caused by virus and antiviral drugs with certain renal toxicity. In addition, due to the potential pathogenicity of the virus to testicular tissues, clinicians should pay attention to the risk of testicular lesions in patients during hospitalization and later clinical follow-up, especially the assessment and appropriate intervention in young patients' fertility",

[Epub ahead of print]  Comparison of influenza-specific neutralizing antibody titers determined using different assay readouts and hemagglutination inhibition titers: good correlation but poor agreement.Sicca F1, Martinuzzi D2, Montomoli E2, Huckriede A3.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Determination of influenza-specific antibody titers is commonly done using the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) and the viral microneutralization assay (MN). Both assays are characterized by high intra- and inter-laboratory variability. The HAI assay offers little opportunity for standardization. For the MN assay, variability might be due to the use of different assay protocols employing different readouts. We therefore aimed at investigating which of the MN assay readout methods currently in use would be the most suitable choice for a standardized MN assay that could serve as a substitute for the HAI assay. For this purpose, human serum samples were tested for the presence of influenza specific neutralizing antibodies against A/California/7/09 H1N1 (49 sera) or A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (50 sera) using four different infection readout methods for the MN assay (cytopathic effect, hemagglutination, ELISA, RT qPCR) and using the HAI assay. The results were compared by correlation analysis and by determining the level of agreement before and after normalization to a standard serum. Titers as measured by the 4 MN assay readouts showed good correlation, with high Person's r for most comparisons. However, agreement between nominal titers varied with readouts compared and virus strain used. In addition, Pearson's correlation of MN titers with HAI titers was high but agreement of nominal titers was moderate and the average difference between the readings of two assays (bias) was virus strain-dependent. Normalization to a standard serum did not result in better agreement of assay results. Our study demonstrates that different MN readouts result in nominally different antibody titers. Accordingly, the use of a common and standardized MN assay protocol will be crucial to minimize inter-laboratory variability. Based on reproducibility, cost effectiveness and unbiased assessment of results we elected the MN assay with ELISA readout as most suitable for a possible replacement of the HAI assay.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Our study aim was to assess the barriers and facilitators regarding maternal immunization acceptance among pregnant women after the launch of this program.\nSTUDY DESIGN:  We conducted a multi-center survey in three Italian cities between March and June 2018. Collected data were analyzed anonymously, and included information about current recommendations of maternal immunization, antenatal care characteristics and reasons for accepting or rejecting vaccination.\nRESULTS:  A total of 743 pregnant women completed the survey. Half of the study population were aged 25-35 years and 88 % were Italian. Only 18 % pregnant women received advice to be vaccinated. In this group, the vaccine was recommended in most cases by an obstetrician-gynecologist (68 %) and during a routine antenatal visit (74 %). Self-reported influenza and pertussis vaccination coverage was 6.5 % (95 % confidence interval, 4.9 %-8.5 %) and 4.8 % (95 % confidence interval, 3.5 %-6.6 %), respectively. The main vaccination barriers identified were lack of vaccine recommendation by any health-care provider (81 %) and safety concerns (18 %). Respondents mentioned the willingness to protect their offspring (82 %) and themselves (66 %) and having received immunization advice by a maternal care provider (62 %), as the main vaccination facilitators.\nCONCLUSIONS:  Lack of immunization advice by health-care providers and safety concerns were the main vaccination barriers against influenza and pertussis, among surveyed pregnant women. Vaccine delivery in the antenatal care setting could lead to increase of vaccine acceptance among pregnant women.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Host Innate Immune Response of Geese Infected with Clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses.Wu S1, Huang J1, Huang Q2, Zhang J1, Liu J1, Xue Q1, Li W1, Liao M1, Jiao P1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Since 2014, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N6 viruses have circulated in waterfowls and caused human infections in China, posing significant threats to the poultry industry and the public health. However, the genetics, pathogenicity and innate immune response of H5N6 HPAIVs in geese remain largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the genetic characteristic of the two H5N6 viruses (GS38 and DK09) isolated from apparently healthy domestic goose and duck in live poultry markets (LPMs) of Southern China in 2016. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the HA genes of the two H5N6 viruses belonged to clade 2.3.4.4 and were clustered into the MIX-like group. The MIX-like group viruses have circulated in regions such as China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. The NA genes of the two H5N6 viruses were classified into the Eurasian sublineage. The internal genes including PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS of the two H5N6 viruses derived from the MIX-like. Therefore, our results suggested that the two H5N6 viruses were reassortants of the H5N1 and H6N6 viruses and likely derived from the same ancestor. Additionally, we evaluated the pathogenicity and transmission of the two H5N6 viruses in domestic geese. Results showed that both the two viruses caused serious clinical symptoms in all inoculated geese and led to high mortality in these birds. Both the two viruses were transmitted efficiently to contact geese and caused lethal infection in these birds. Furthermore, we found that mRNA of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), interferons (IFNs), and stimulated genes (ISGs) exhibited different levels of activation in the lungs and spleens of the two H5N6 viruses-inoculated geese though did not protect these birds from H5N6 HPAIVs infection. Our results suggested that the clade 2.3.4.4 waterfowl-origin H5N6 HPAIVs isolated from LPMs of Southern China could cause high mortality in geese and innate immune-related genes were involved in the geese innate immune response to H5N6 HPAIVs infection. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the evolution, pathogenic variations of these viruses and enhance virological surveillance of clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 HPAIVs in waterfowls in China.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  H5N6; genetics; goose; host innate immune response; pathogenicity\n\n PMID: \t32046051 \tDOI: \t10.3390/microorganisms8020224 \n  Free full text",

Few studies on its rate were reported throughout China and for populations with chronic diseases. An estimation of the rates in China was accomplished.\nMETHODS:  All data were from a national cross-sectional survey of a sample representing the population aged 40 years or older in mainland China in 2014-15. A total of 74,484 individuals with complete self-reported influenza vaccination status were analyzed in 2018-19.\nRESULTS:  The overall influenza vaccination rate was 2.4% (95% CI 1.4-3.3) with 1.7% (95% CI 1.2-2.2) for the age group 40-59 years and 3.8% (95% CI 1.6-5.9) for the group \u226560 years. The rate was 4.0% (95% CI 2.0-5.9) among people with a chronic disease. People with asthma and people with emphysema had the highest rates (7.1%, 95% CI 3.2-11.0 and 6.6%, 95% CI 3.6-9.7) while people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and people with chronic bronchitis had the lower rates (3.6%, 95% CI 2.0-5.2 and 4.8%, 95% CI 2.6-7.0). The rate was the highest among former smokers (3.3%, 95% CI 2.3-4.4) compared to current smokers (1.8%, 95% CI 0.9-2.7) and never smokers (2.5%, 95% CI 1.4-3.6). People living with finance-reimbursed vaccination policy, a positive factor for vaccination, had a higher vaccination rate (11.5%, 95% CI 10.8-12.2) (p < 0.05). People with older age, higher education level, occupation of professionals or technical personnel, living in rural areas or Northern China, former/never smoking were more likely to be vaccinated (p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS:  The influenza vaccination rate is low among adults aged \u226540 years, those \u226560 years and those with chronic diseases in China. Reimbursement policy targeting the elderly should be implemented widely and strategies towards patients with chronic diseases need urgent attention to increase the influenza vaccination coverage.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Brainstem folding in an influenza child with Dandy-Walker variant.Li SY1, Li PQ1, Xiao WQ2, Liu HS2, Yang SD3.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  Influenza in children is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Nervous system diseases are a factor relating to increased mortality rate. However, reports of how these underlying diseases contribute to the death of children with influenza are rare.\nCASE SUMMARY:  A 4-year-old-girl developed type A influenza-related encephalopathy (IAE) with seizures, acute disorder of consciousness, and intracranial hypertension (cerebrospinal fluid pressure: 250 mmH2O), and the Dandy-Walker variant was found by her first magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when admission. Three days later, she suddenly presented anisocoria, acute pulmonary edema, and coma, and the later MRI found that she had compressed brainstem, oblongata \"Z-like folding\", and swelling bilateral basal ganglia. After admission, the patient were tested for routine and special biomarkers and underwent neuroimaging and neuroelectrophysiology examinations as well as Oseltamivir and intravenous immunogloblin treatments. When predicting that unstable intracranial structures detected by MRI might have disastrous consequences in the progression of IAE, she was transferred into the pediatric intensive care unit and underwent continuous assessment of clinical condition while she did not have instability of basic vital signs; at the same time, her parents were fully informed about the risk and prognosis. Although she was ultimately dead from brain stem failure, the parents expressed understanding and did not trigger a doctor-patient conflict.\nCONCLUSION:  In case of finding an unstable intracranial structure, intensive care should be given to IAE patient and their clinical condition should be monitored continuously.\n  \u00a9The Author(s) 2020.

Wild migratory birds and contaminated environmental sources such as waterbodies soiled with bird droppings play a significant role in the transmission of AI viruses. The objective of the present study was to develop a sensitive and user-friendly method for the concentration and detection of AI viruses from environmental water sources.\nMethods:  Municipal potable water, surface water from reservoirs and sea were spiked with low pathogenic AI viruses. To concentrate the viruses by precipitation, a combination of potassium aluminium sulphate with milk powder was used. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed for virus detection, and the results were compared with a virus concentration method using erythrocytes. Drinking water specimens from poultry markets were also tested for the presence of AI viruses.\nResults:  A minimum of 101.0 EID50(50% egg infectious dose)/ml spiked H5N1 and 101.7 EID50/ml spiked H9N2 viruses were detected from spiked potable water; 101.0 and 102.0 EID50/ml spiked H5N1 virus was detected from surface water and seawater samples, respectively. The present method was more sensitive than the erythrocyte-binding method as approximately 10-fold higher infectious virus titres were obtained. AI H9N2 viruses were detected and isolated from water from local poultry markets, using this method.\nInterpretation & conclusions:  Viability and recovery of the spiked viruses were not affected by precipitation. The present method may be suitable for the detection of AI viruses from different environmental water sources and can also be applied during outbreak investigations.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Avian influenza virus; detection; environmental water; outbreak; surveillance; virus precipitation\n\n PMID: \t32048625 \tDOI: \t10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_1697_18",

One dose (0.5 ml) of either vaccine contained 15 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin of each influenza virus strain recommended by WHO for the Northern hemisphere in 2016-2017 flu season. The observation period lasted 21 days. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03016143.Results: Assessment of immunogenic activity of the vaccine under study showed that in 21 days the portion of participants with 4-fold seroconversions was 80.0% to \u0410/H1N1; 65.0% to \u0410/H3N2 and 64.0% to B virus. Antibody titer increase factor in the group of subjects that received RIBSP vaccine was 13.4 for \u0410/H1N1; 5.2 for \u0410/H3N2 and 5.2 for B virus. The subjects that received RIBSP vaccine demonstrated 88% seroprotection rate against \u0410/H1N1; 75% against \u0410/H3N2 and 61% against B virus. In the course of evaluating the vaccine safety, no serious adverse events were recorded. All changes of laboratory data were slight and single in most cases. All recorded local reactions have been light in character and these have been predicted reactions observed at vaccination against influenza.Conclusion: Comparison vaccines RIBSP and VAXIGRIP\u00ae, showed similar immunogenic activity. The RIBSP vaccine is safe and immunogenic for the elderly and conforms to international criteria in CPMP/BWP/214/96.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Humoral immunity; Influenza virus; Vaccines/vaccines strains\n\n PMID: \t32048890 \tDOI: \t10.1080/21645515.2019.1705691",

This study aimed to review the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines with MF59 adjuvant and non-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccines among all age groups against specific influenza vaccine strains.\nMETHODS:  Literature search of PubMed, Embase, Medline, OVID, and Cochrane Library Trials (CENTRAL) was implemented up to March 1, 2019. Homogeneity qualified studies were included forData were extracted such as study country location, demographic characteristics, and measure outcomes, and were analyzed by a random effect model and sensitivity analyses to identify heterogeneity. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.\nRESULTS:  We retrieved 1,021 publications and selected 31 studies for full review, including 17 trials for meta-analysis and 6 trials for qualitative synthesis. MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccines demonstrated better immunogenicity against specific vaccine virus strains compared to non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine both in healthy adult group (RR\u200a=\u200a2.10; 95% CI: 1.28-3.44) and the healthy aged (RR\u200a=\u200a1.26; 95% CI: 1.10-1.44).\nCONCLUSION:  The quality of evidence is moderate to high for seroconversion and seroprotection rates of influenza vaccine. MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccines are superior to non-adjuvanted influenza vaccines to enhance immune responses of vaccination in healthy adults and older adults, and could be considered for routine use especially the monovalent prepandemic influenza vaccines.\n\n\n PMID: \t32049815 \tDOI: \t10.1097/MD.0000000000019095 \n  Free full text",

Understanding the transmission patterns and epidemic features of influenza may facilitate the improvement of preventive and control measures. This study aims to assess the epidemic features of influenza among different climate zones and identify high-risk zones across Gansu province, China.\nMETHODS:  We collected weekly influenza cases at county-level between 1st January 2012 and 31st December 2016, as well as climate zones classification shapefile data from K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate map. We compared the epidemic features (Frequency index (\u03b1), Duration index (\u03b2) and Intensity index (\u03b3)) of influenza among different climate zones. Spatial cluster analysis was used to examine the high-risk areas of transmission of influenza.\nRESULTS:  The distribution of cases existed significant differences among eight climate zones (F-test: 267.02, p < 0.05). The highest mean weekly incidence rate (per 100,000 population) was 0.59 in snow climate with dry winter and warm summer (Dwb). The primary (relative risk (RR): 3.61, p < 0.001) and secondary (RR: 2.45, p < 0.001) clusters were located in Dwb. The highest values of \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 were 1.00, 261 and 154.38 in Dwb. The hot spots (high-high clusters) of the epidemic indices were detected in Dwb.\nCONCLUSIONS:  This study found the variability of epidemic features of influenza among eight climate zones. We highlight that Dwb was the high-risk zone where influenza clustered with the highest incidence rate and epidemic temporal indices. This provide further insight into potential improvement of preventive measures by climate zones to minimize the impact of epidemics.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.

We estimated the end-of season vaccine effectiveness (VE) by age, among community patients with influenza-like illness (ILI), considering the hemagglutinin (HA) gene mutations and amino acid substitutions of influenza A (H3N2) viruses detected. Methods: Nose-throat samples were analyzed for the presence of influenza virus, type/subtype, and HA gene sequence. HA gene sequences and amino acid substitutions were compared to the influenza A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2)-like 2018-2019 vaccine virus, and a phylogenetic tree was generated. Influenza VE against influenza A (H3N2) was estimated using the test-negative design. VE was estimated by age group and by 15 year moving age intervals. Results: In total, 90% of the influenza A (H3N2) viruses belonged to the 3C.3a clade, constituting a unique situation in the northern hemisphere. Adjusted all-age influenza A (H3N2) VE was -3.5% (95% CI: -51.2 to 29.1). Although adjusted VEs were very low among infants, children, and young adults, a VE of 45% (95% CI: -19.2 to 74.6) was estimated among adults aged \u226545 years old. Conclusions: The higher VE point estimates among older adults may be related to previous exposure to similar influenza viruses.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  drift; influenza A (H3N2); influenza vaccine; vaccine effectiveness\n\n PMID: \t32050460 \tDOI: \t10.3390/vaccines8010078",

[Epub ahead of print]  Risk assessment for recrudescence of avian influenza in caged layer houses following depopulation: the effect of cleansing, disinfection and dismantling of equipment.Gale P1, Sechi S2, Horigan V1, Taylor R1, Brown I3, Kelly L1,2.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Following an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) in a poultry house, control measures are put in place to prevent further spread. An essential part of the control measures based on the European Commission Avian Influenza Directive 2005/94/EC is the cleansing and disinfection (C&D) of infected premises. Cleansing and disinfection includes both preliminary and secondary C&D, and the dismantling of complex equipment during secondary C&D is also required, which is costly to the owner and also delays the secondary cleansing process, hence increasing the risk for onward spread. In this study, a quantitative risk assessment is presented to assess the risk of re-infection (recrudescence) occurring in an enriched colony-caged layer poultry house on restocking with chickens after different C&D scenarios. The risk is expressed as the number of restocked poultry houses expected before recrudescence occurs. Three C&D scenarios were considered, namely (i) preliminary C&D alone, (ii) preliminary C&D plus secondary C&D without dismantling and (iii) preliminary C&D plus secondary C&D with dismantling. The source-pathway-receptor framework was used to construct the model, and parameterisation was based on the three C&D scenarios. Two key operational variables in the model are (i) the time between depopulation of infected birds and restocking with new birds (TbDR) and (ii) the proportion of infected material that bypasses C&D, enabling virus to survive the process. Probability distributions were used to describe these two parameters for which there was recognised variability between premises in TbDR or uncertainty due to lack of information in the fraction of bypass. The risk assessment estimates that the median (95% credible intervals) number of repopulated poultry houses before recrudescence are 1.2 \u00d7 104 (50 to 2.8 \u00d7 106), 1.9 \u00d7 105 (780 to 5.7 \u00d7 107) and 1.1 \u00d7 106 (4.2 \u00d7 103 to 2.9 \u00d7 108) under C&D scenarios (i), (ii) and (iii), respectively. Thus for HPAIV in caged layers, undertaking secondary C&D without dismantling reduces the risk by 16-fold compared to preliminary C&D alone. Dismantling has an additional, although smaller, impact, reducing the risk by a further 6-fold and thus around 90-fold compared to preliminary C&D alone. On the basis of the 95% credible intervals, the model demonstrates the importance of secondary C&D (with or without dismantling) over preliminary C&D alone. However, the extra protection afforded by dismantling may not be cost beneficial in the context of reduced risk of onward spread.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  control; notifiable avian disease; outbreak; policy; poultry house\n\n PMID: \t32051058 \tDOI: \t10.1017/S175173112000018X",

[Clinical features of influenza with plastic bronchitis in children].[Article in Chinese]\n\nYang Q1, Bao YM, Yi QW, Wang W, Zheng YJ.\nAuthor informationAbstract OBJECTIVE:  To study the clinical features of influenza with plastic bronchitis (PB) in children, and to improve the awareness of the diagnosis and treatment of PB caused by influenza virus.\nMETHODS:  A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 70 children with lower respiratory influenza virus infection from October 2018 to October 2019. According to the presence or absence of PB, they were divided into an influenza+PB group with 12 children and a non-PB influenza group with 58 children. Related clinical data were collected for the retrospective analysis, including general information, clinical manifestations, laboratory examination, imaging findings, treatment, and prognosis.\nRESULTS:  In the influenza+PB group, most children experienced disease onset at the age of 1-5 years, with the peak months of January, February, July, and September. Major clinical manifestations in the influenza+PB group included fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The influenza+PB group had significantly higher incidence rates of shortness of breath and allergic diseases such as asthma than the non-PB influenza group (P<0.05). Of the 12 children in the influenza+PB group, 7(58%) had influenza A virus infection and 5 (42%) had influenza B virus infection, among whom 1 had nephrotic syndrome. For the children in the influenza+PB group, major imaging findings included pulmonary consolidation with atelectasis, high-density infiltration, pleural effusion, and mediastinal emphysema. Compared with the non-PB influenza group, the influenza+PB group had a significantly higher proportion of children who were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (P<0.05). Bronchoscopic lavage was performed within 1 week after admission, and all children were improved and discharged after anti-infective therapy and symptomatic/supportive treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS:  Influenza with PB tends to have acute onset and rapid progression, and it is important to perform bronchoscopy as early as possible. The possibility of PB should be considered when the presence of shortness of breath, allergic diseases such as asthma or nephrotic syndrome in children with influenza.\n\n\n PMID: \t32051075",

Necroptotic cell death is potently immunogenic, and limits IAV spread by directly eliminating infected cells and by mobilizing both innate and adaptive immune responses. The benefits of necroptosis to the host, however, may sometimes be outweighed by the potentially deleterious hyperinflammatory consequences of activating this death modality in pulmonary and other tissues.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 American Society for Microbiology.\n\n\n PMID: \t32051270 \tDOI: \t10.1128/JVI.01101-19",

[Epub ahead of print]  Estimating the fiscal impact of three vaccination strategies in Italy.Ruggeri M1, Di Brino E1, Cicchetti A1.\nAuthor informationAbstract OBJECTIVES:  When assessing the economic value of vaccines, decision makers should adopt a full societal perspective. One approach for estimation of the fiscal impact of a disease is to use the human capital method to determine productivity losses. The aim of this study was to test an analytical framework developed for the estimation of the fiscal impacts of vaccination programs for influenza (FLU), pneumococcus (PC), and herpes zoster (HZ), in Italy.\nMETHODS:  We tested the framework in a two-stage analysis. First, we estimated the fiscal impact of the disease, second we performed a cost-benefit analysis of the individual benefits of vaccination against the cost of the vaccine. To estimate the fiscal impact of the diseases, the human capital approach was used. Epidemiological data were extrapolated from the literature. A Monte Carlo simulation enabled exploration of the uncertainty in the model variables.\nRESULTS:  For FLU, assuming 2.1 million people infected, the total expected impact was EUR 999,371,520; the estimated fiscal impact was EUR 159,563,520. For PC, assuming 90,000 people infected, the total impact was EUR 148,055,040 and the estimated fiscal impact was EUR 23,639,040. For HZ, assuming 6,400 people infected, the total impact was EUR 4,777,200, with EUR 630,000 resulting from a decrease in fiscal taxation.\nCONCLUSIONS:  In conclusion, our work shows how traditional methods aimed at estimating the cost of illness from a social perspective can be improved by additionally considering the fiscal impact, which accounts for the decrease in fiscal revenues due to illness.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Fiscal impact; Productivity loss; Social cost; Vaccination strategy\n\n PMID: \t32052725 \tDOI: \t10.1017/S0266462320000069",

Group-AV patients were initiated on Oseltamivir without any antibiotic in treatment regimen while Group-AV+AZ patients were initiated on Oseltamivir and Azithromycin combination therapy for at least 3-5 days. Patients were evaluated for different clinical outcomes.Results: A total of 227 and 102 patients were identified for Group-AV and Group-AV+AZ respectively. The identified patients of both groups were mostly unvaccinated. Multivariate regression analysis showed that incidences of secondary bacterial infections were significantly less frequent (23.4% vs 10.4%; P-value=0.019) in Group-AV+AZ patients.

The CDC estimates that flu has sickened at least 26 million Americans this season and led to 250,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths.\n  The percentage of clinic visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) rose to 6.8% last week, up from 6.6% the week before, while the share of respiratory samples at clinical labs that tested positive for flu rose from 30.1% to 30.8%.\n  The number of jurisdictions reporting high ILI activity\u2014another clinic-visit marker\u2014dropped a bit, from 47 to 46. The number of jurisdictions reporting regional or widespread flu remained at 51 for the third week in a row.\n  Among specimens tested at public health labs, 66.2% were influenza A and 33.8% influenza B for the week. Until recent weeks, flu B had predominated the entire season. Of the A strains subtyped, 95.5% were the H1N1 strain and 4.5% the H3N2 strain.\n  The hospitalization rate rose to 41.9 per 100,000 population, which the CDC says is similar to levels usually seen at this time of the year. The previous week saw a hospitalization rate of 35.5 per 100,000 population. As in previous weeks, the elderly have the highest hospitalization rates.\n  The 14 deaths in children occurred from the end of December 2019 to last week. Ten were tied to influenza B and 4 to influenza A. Of the latter, 2 were subtyped, with 1 being the H1N1 strain and one H3N2.\nFeb 14 CDC FluView update\n\nSix African and Asian countries report new polio cases  Six countries in Africa and Asia\u2014Pakistan, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Angola, Ethiopia, and the Philippines\u2014have reported a total of 21 new polio cases in the past week, according to the latest update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI).\n  Ethiopia led the list with 7 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2): 4 in Oromiya province and 3 in the Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples' Regional State (SNNPR). Only one case had onset of paralysis this year. Of 12 cVDPV2 cases reported in Ethiopia so far, 4 cases are linked to an outbreak in neighbouring Somalia, the GPEI said.\n  The DRC reported 2 cases of cVDPV2 in Kwilu province and 2 in Sankuru, according to the DRC country update in the report. With onsets last year, these raised the number of 2019 cVDPV cases to 84. (A summary of new cases in the same report mentioned only 2 cases in the DRC; further information about the DRC case count could not be immediately obtained.)\n  The DRC reported 2 cases of cVDPV2 in Kwilu province and 2 in Sankuru. With onsets last year, these raised the number of 2019 cVDPV cases to 84.\n  In Angola, 3 cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week, 1 each in Bi\u00e9, Huambo, and Namibe provinces. None of the cases had onset this year. The country had 114 vaccine-derived cases in seven outbreaks last year.\n  Nigeria reported its first cVDPV2 case with onset this year, in Anambra province. The government reported 18 cVDPV2 cases in the country last year.\n  The Philippines also noted its first cVDPV2 case with onset this year, in Central Luzon province. The count of vaccine-derived cases for 2019 remains at 15.\n  So far this year, 18 new polio cases (12 WPV and 6 cVDPV) have been reported globally, compared with 15 (9 WPV and 6 cVDPV) at this time last year.\nFeb 13 GPEI report",

No details were available about the members who are part of the joint mission.\n  Meanwhile the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean regional office (WHO EMRO) today on Twitter confirmed Egypt's first COVID-19 case, which was reported by the country's health ministry today. The WHO's Egypt office said on its Twitter account that the patient is a foreigner who is asymptomatic and is isolated in the hospital in stable condition.\nConfirmed health worker infections triple  At a media briefing in China today, a top health official said 1,716 healthcare workers have been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, 6 of them fatally, Reuters reported today.\n  Zeng Yixin, the National Health Commission (NHC) vice minister, said the number of infected healthcare workers is rising and that they are facing heavy and tiring workloads. He said 87% of the infected medical staff are from Hubei province, the outbreak's epicenter.\n  The number reported today is more than triple the 500 case number reported earlier this week by the South China Morning Post, based in information shared by Chinese hospital sources. They told the paper that at least 500 cases had been reported as of the middle of January.\n  Before that, China had first acknowledged only 14 or 15 cases in a Wuhan hospital. Then in a Feb 7 medical journal report on 138 cases at a Wuhan hospital, Chinese researchers noted that hospital-related transmission was responsible for 41% of the illnesses\u201440 health workers and 17 patients.\n  At today's WHO media briefing, Tedros said the information on health care worker infections is a critical piece of information \"because health workers are the glue that holds the health system and outbreak response together. But we need to know more about this figure, including the time period and circumstances in which the health workers became sick.\"\n  Mike Ryan, MD, who directs the WHO's health emergencies program, said for now it appears that the percentage of healthcare worker infections for COVID-19 is lower than for other coronaviruses, but added that it's not a guarantee. \"We've always said the real point of entry for coronavirus is a busy emergency room.\" WHO officials said health workers in China are under tremendous pressure, and they're eager learn how medical teams were exposed, such as in emergency departments or while treating patients.\n  Meanwhile, China's National Health Commission today reported 5,090 new confirmed cases, boosting the overall 63,851. The new cases presumably reflect a number of clinically confirmed cases from Hubei province, based on the country's announcement yesterday about a change in reporting criteria for the outbreak's epicenter.\n  Also, China reported 121 more deaths and 2,174 more severe cases, raising those overall totals to 1,380 and 10,204, respectively. Health officials deleted some earlier Hubei cases, because some had been double-counted.\nLocal cases climb in Singapore, Japan  Singapore's health ministry today reported 9 more COVID-19 infections, all of them apparently local cases, raising the country's total to 67, the most outside of China, excluding the cluster on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.\n  Six of the new cases are part of a known church cluster, and one is a contact of an earlier confirmed case. Investigations are under way into how the other two patients were exposed to the virus.\n  In related developments, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned today that the COVID-19 outbreak could push the country into an economic recession and that the country was bracing for a \"significant hit\" in the quarters ahead, Reuters reported, based on comments Loong made in a Facebook video.\n  Elsewhere, Japan's health ministry today reported 6 more cases in five different cities, raising its total to 37. Investigations are under way into the source of exposure, though one patient had a close conversation with a tourist from Wuhan. Two have links to the Diamond Princess cruise ship, including a taxi driver who drove passengers from the boat after they disembarked, the Straits Times reported today. One is the patient who was at the same facility where an infected surgeon worked.\n  The WHO said today in its daily situation report that it received reports of 58 new cases outside of China over the last 24 hours, raising the total to 505 in 24 countries. Two of the illnesses were fatal.\nStudy: Hospitalized babies fared well  In research developments, a team from China today reported the first findings in hospitalized infants, a small group of 9, all of whom were contacts of an infected family member. Investigators published their findings in a research letter to the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).\n  The babies\u2014ages 1 month to 11 months\u2014were hospitalized between December and Feb 6 in seven different cities, though seven of them were reported to be living in Wuhan or had links to Wuhan.\n  Four had fever and two had mild upper respiratory symptoms. None of them needed intensive care or experienced severe illness. Seven of the babies were girls, and researchers said further study is needed to assess if girls are more susceptible to the disease.\nSee also:\n  Feb 14 WHO EMRO tweet\n  Feb 14 WHO Egypt office tweet\n  Feb 14 China NHC daily report\n  Feb 14 Reuters story on infected health workers\n  Feb 14 Singapore health ministry statement\n  Feb 14 Reuters story on Singapore's economy\n  Feb 14 Japan health ministry statement\n  Feb 14 Japan health ministry statement on 37th case\n  Feb 14 Straits Times story\n  Feb 14 WHO daily situation report\n  Feb 14 JAMA letter",

Then the crisis passes and no one pays attention until the next crisis.\"\n\nNow that the next crisis seems to be arriving in the form of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, exactly how ready are US hospitals?\n\nMost agree that the good intentions of 2014 prompted some progress, but whether it's enough is the $10 million question.\n\nAs the challenges specific to this virus begin to emerge, experts say hospitals are\u2014or should be\u2014preparing for a surge in patients, training healthcare workers in the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and coordinating with public health officials on testing procedures.\n\nProgress since earlier outbreaks\n\n\nThe SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic of 2003 offers perhaps the best lesson for hospitals, Toner said: \"The greatest risk is from an unsuspected patient in an unprepared hospital.\"\n\nMore recently, the Ebola scare underscored the need for streamlined communication and collaboration, something not easy to accomplish in the disjointed US healthcare system.\n\nTo address that need, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) formed the National Ebola Training and Education Center (NETEC) in 2015. Led by three organizations that successfully treated Ebola patients\u2014Emory University, the University of Nebraska Medical Center/Nebraska Medicine and the New York Health and Hospitals Corporation, Bellevue Hospital Center\u2014NETEC now offers hospitals centralized knowledge: resources, including education and training; readiness consultations; and a research network that can fast-track studies through its own institutional review board.\n\nHHS also created a network for future infectious disease outbreaks, designating 10 hospitals as regional special pathogen treatment centers. Not only are those 10 frontline hospitals better prepared for an outbreak, but they educate other hospitals between outbreaks, said Courtney Gidengil, MD, MPH, a senior physician policy researcher at the Rand Corporation who co-authored a report on hospital readiness for infectious disease outbreaks in 2018.\n\nThat report applauded those efforts, but also recommended steps to strengthen and build on them and formalize networks, since the degree to which the more than 5,000 US hospitals use those resources varies. And which hospital a patient with COVID-19 presents to is completely random: there's no path to direct a patient to a hospital that's particularly well prepared, Gidengil said.\n\n\"One of the biggest concerns is that while front-line hospitals are prepared, it's completely unpredictable where a patient will present,\" she said, referring to the regional hub hospitals.\n\nMost healthcare centers, Toner noted, don't even have a full-time emergency manager. The person tapped for that job usually has other responsibilities, most of which appear more urgent until an outbreak arrives.\n\n\"I think that most hospitals probably have plans which they probably have not looked seriously at since Ebola in 2014 or the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. And if they looked at their plans, they probably have not done the same degree of education, training, and practice that they needed to do since the last infectious disease emergency.\"\nA likely hospital scenario\n\n\nIdeally, said Paul Biddinger, MD, chief of the division of emergency preparedness at Massachusetts General Hospital, the Region 1 regional special pathogen treatment center, each hospital would be prepared now to treat a patient having COVID-19 symptoms like this:\n\nAs soon as someone walks into a hospital, signage, questionnaires, and prompts in the electronic health record would be in place to ask about possible symptoms and exposure to the COVID-19 virus. Once the person is suspected of having COVID-19, that patient would be given an N95 respirator (see yesterday's CIDRAP News story) and placed in an isolation room.\n\nThen, only staff who have been trained in proper protocols for donning and doffing PPE\u2014likely from the emergency department\u2014would provide clinical assessment and care. If the patient's symptoms warrant testing, the hospital would contact the state public health department. If health department experts agreed with the need for testing, they would contact the CDC. The hospital would send the sample to the state, and the state would pass it on to the CDC.\n\nIf COVID-19 patients are generally well, they could be isolated at home and carefully monitored by public health officials. If they need to be hospitalized, they would need to be in an airborne infection isolation [AII] room with trained staff and overall guidance to manage visitors and items entering and leaving the room. \"They need to manage as though they are infected until we know they are not,\" Biddinger said.\n\nBut even if a hospital can perform those steps successfully on a few patients, what happens if the caseload increases 100-fold?\n\nOnly limited surge capacity\n\n\nIt's still unclear exactly how contagious COVID-19 is, but experts say it appears to transmit more like the flu than Ebola, and it has spread rapidly in China and appears to be escalating in Singapore.\n\nEspecially if patients continue to need isolation rooms, hospitals could quickly get overwhelmed, Biddinger said.\n\n\"The more patients we have, the harder it will become,\" Biddinger said. \"It places a severe demand on personal protective equipment and on the spaces we have available.\"\n\nEven the regional hubs, which are required to have at least 10 AII rooms, would be hard-pressed to treat masses of patients with COVID-19 simultaneously. Some hospitals have the ability to turn an entire floor or wing into a negative-pressure area, Biddinger said, but that produces other challenges, such as requiring healthcare workers to wear PPE the entire time they're in the space, and the ability to make a definitive diagnosis before a patient enters the area. It also displaces the patients who had been housed in that section.\n\n\"If we start to see large numbers of patients presenting for diagnosis or who need hospitalization or intensive care, we already operate at full capacity or beyond, so it's extremely challenging to change quickly and make sure we can provide safe care for everyone,\" Biddinger said.\n\nIndeed, if the mortality rate of COVID-19 continues to drop as many experts expect, the bigger health threat could become the lack of services for critically ill people in overcrowded hospitals, Gidengil said.\n\nA surge of patients could also pose supply issues, experts said, especially PPE. Not only is there already a tremendous demand for PPE in China, but an escalating outbreak could shut down many of the factories that manufacture such supplies in China.\n\nChallenges posed by PPE\n\n\nWhen two nurses who treated the first Ebola patient in the country contracted the diseasein 2014\u2014even though adequate facilities and equipment were available\u2014the lesson of proper donning and doffing of PPE hit home.\n\nNow, with more than 1,700 health care workers infected in China, experts are reminding hospitals that training staff on proper protocols could be critical in preventing COVID-19 spread in healthcare settings.\nEven though healthcare workers should be relatively familiar with the PPE, including N95s, Gidengil said, healthcare facilities should be fitting the respirators, offering refreshers on donning and doffing, and reviewing best practices.\n\n\"You can contaminate yourself by touching the outside of the equipment and then touching yourself,\" Toner said. \"Or by taking things off in the wrong order.\"\n\nThe good news is that message is better received now, Biddinger said.\n\nOver the past 5 years, Mass General has developed a toolkit of plans, protocols, exercises and videos for various diseases requiring different types of PPE \"We've pushed that out across the entire region to help other hospitals get ready faster,\" Biddinger said.\n\nOffsite testing slows hospital response\n\n\nComplicating matters at the moment is the current cumbersome process of testing patients. In the beginning stages, all tests for COVID-19 in the country had to be sent to the CDC in Atlanta, via state public health departments, a process that quickly created bottlenecks.\n\nSeveral public health labs received their own test kits on Feb. 7, but some reported glitches when they tried to validate the tests, including the Minnesota Department of Health, according to Richard N. Danila, PhD, MPH, deputy state epidemiologist. The CDC has said it will send replacements \"soon.\" Once state public health labs\u2014and eventually, major hospitals\u2014have effective kits, the turnaround time should be reduced. But for now the lag time to get results is several days, Danila said.\n\nIn the meantime, hospitals have to figure out who needs to be treated with special precautions and how to best isolate patients.\n\nIt's a predicament complicated by high flu activity. Distinguishing between the flu and COVID-19\u2014especially with a rapid flu test that is not highly sensitive\u2014is tricky, Toner said. At the moment, hospitals can earmark potential COVID-19 cases by the person's connection to China or someone known to have the disease. But if the virus starts spreading locally, it will become even harder to discern without distinguishing features from the flu, Toner said.\n\n\nUncertainty remains\n\n\"Part of the question remains, prepared for what?\" Biddinger said in pondering how the outbreak might evolve. \"Obviously it is very hard to plan because there are so many significant unknowns.\"\n\nAs understanding of the COVID-19 virus and transmission pattern builds over the coming weeks, hospitals will have to refine readiness efforts, he said.\n\nIn some scenarios, that could come as a relief: If evidence points toward transmission via large droplets only, for example, \"that would be a clear game-changer,\" Biddinger said, since AII rooms and N95 respirators wouldn't be needed.\n\nIn the meantime, healthcare leaders should be managing fear and building trust in US healthcare, experts said.\n\n\"The more we feed fear about the virus and only talk about the narrative of its deadly potential, the more we run the risk of overloading hospitals with patients with mild illness,\" he said, noting that that has happened in China.\n\n\"There's no question we are in a better position now to follow the CDC's 'Identify, Isolate and Inform' guidance than we were in 2014-15,\" Biddinger said. \"Emergency departments have good training resources, they understand the importance of this, and they can build on previous plans for prior outbreaks.\"\n\n\nSee also:\nFeb 13 CIDRAP News story \"China reports gush of retrospective COVID-19 cases\"\nFeb 12 CIDRAP News story \"Glitch delays COVID-19 tests for states as first evacuees cleared\"",

Its first phase will be launched at public health labs that are part of the flu surveillance system in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, and New York City.\n  At a media briefing today, Nancy Messonnier, MD, who directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said surveillance at those five sites is just a starting point and that COVID-19 surveillance will expand nationally in the coming weeks. \"This is an efficient way for us to stand up surveillance,\" she said.\n  Though the goal is still to contain the virus, global health officials worry that it may be already circulating undetected in countries outside China. For now, all 15 cases in the United States have been linked to Hubei province travelers or their close contacts, but Messonnier said the pattern could change, and federal health officials want to be prepared.\n  The initial US plan to detect community spread hinges on public health lab workers testing samples that are negative for flu for the virus that causes COVID-19. She said any positive tests would be a warning signal that would drive a change in public health strategy.\n  Messonnier said the CDC has the resources it needs to respond to and prepare for COVID-19. She expressed gratitude to Congress for earlier investments that built the flu surveillance system that health officials are now leaning on to watch for an outbreak of the new respiratory disease.\n  And she said rapid-response funding has been a game changer: \"Right now, funding hasn't been a constraint.\"\nTesting protocol change for evacuees  Also today, Messonnier explained a change in testing for quarantined evacuees. The initial group of 195 people were tested for the virus, but since then, she said, the CDC has learned more about how the virus behaves in people.\n  About 600 people are still in quarantine, and the CDC will now limit testing to people with a history of exposure who have symptoms. She said testing people too early may result in a negative test that could provide a false sense of security. Messonnier emphasized that the worry isn't about false negative results, but rather that virus levels haven't risen enough to become detectable.\n  Evacuees have their temperatures taken twice a day, and health officials continuously monitor their symptoms.",

I am speaking to you from Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, where I have met with President Tshisekedi, ministers, UN colleagues and other partners \u2013 to review the impressive progress that has been made toward ending the Ebola outbreak, and to talk about future plans to ensure that everyone in the DRC can access quality health services going forward.\n  I have been impressed with the commitment of President Tshisekedi and his government to ending the outbreak in eastern DRC and I would like to urge the whole world to recommit to getting to zero Ebola cases. But it is also vitally important that resources and attention focus on strengthening the country\u2019s health system and bolstering preparedness.\n  Whether it\u2019s Ebola or COVID-19, investing in preparedness is the smartest way to ensure disease outbreaks are identified and stopped quickly.\n  I am glad to say that countries around the world are in a better state of preparedness for COVID-19 than they were just a week ago, and WHO\u2019s efforts to help countries boost their lab capacity continue.\n  Now the latest numbers on the COVID-19 outbreak.\n  As you know, China has changed the way it reports data from Hubei province.\n  There are now a total of 47,505 laboratory-confirmed cases in China, and 16,427 cases that have been clinically-confirmed in Hubei province.\n  While it\u2019s not uncommon in outbreaks for case definitions to change over time as more information becomes available, we are seeking further clarity on how clinical diagnosis is being made, to ensure other respiratory illnesses including influenza are not getting mixed into the COVID-19 data.\n  In total, there have been 1,381 deaths in China, including 121 reported today.\n  Outside China, there have been 505 cases in 24 countries and two deaths. \n  The vice minister of the national health commission has said that as of Tuesday 1716 health care workers have been infected, and six have died.\n  This is a critical piece of information, because health workers are the glue that holds the health system and outbreak response together. But we need to know more about this figure, including the time period and circumstances in which the health workers became sick.\n  WHO guidelines have been developed for health workers taking care of hospitalised adults and paediatric patients with acute infections. These guidelines have been made available to all countries.\n  As I said the other day, we have been in regular contact with suppliers, asking them to prioritize production and distribution of personal protective equipment to health workers on the front lines. We are also in touch with Member States on this important issue.\n  I\u2019m glad to say that the WHO-led Joint Mission with China on COVID-19is moving forward. We expect the full team to touch down over the weekend.\n  The mission consists of 12 international and WHO experts and a similar number of national expert counterparts from the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n  The Joint Mission will include in-depth workshops, a data review with the principal ministries, a series of meetings with key national-level institutions and field visits in three provinces to understand the application and impact of response activities at provincial and county levels, including urban and rural settings. \n  The goal of the joint mission is to rapidly inform the next steps in the COVID-19 response and preparedness activities in China and globally.\n  Particular attention will be paid to understanding the transmission of the virus, the severity of disease, and the impact of ongoing response measures.\n  Furthermore, it will be important to review which type of information is needed so that the world can use this window of opportunity to prepare health systems and workers for possible outbreaks.  \n  Clearly this is an evolving picture. Health workers and responders in China are working with virtually no sleep in difficult conditions. But we need to ensure that we\u2019re getting the most accurate data, as quickly as possible, to assist China and support the global response.\n  We\u2019re working with our Chinese counterparts on these issues, and this is also part of the scope of work for the WHO-led joint mission with China.\n  Finally, I wish to thank Cambodia for demonstrating to the world the meaning of solidarity.\n  While other countries turned away the Westerdam cruise ship, Cambodia allowed it to dock.\n  Today hundreds of passengers are disembarking and are en route to their home countries.\n  20 passengers who reported signs of illness have tested negative for the COVID-19 virus.\n  I hope that other countries will follow Cambodia\u2019s lead.\n  Lastly, I want to say again, from my heart, that this is the time for solidarity, not stigma. There are worrying signs that the world is not hearing the call for unity and standing in unison with those at the epicenter in China who are saving lives and alleviating suffering.\n  I thank you.",

In a study published this week in Emerging Infectious Diseases, epidemiologists from the Tennessee Department of Health and Vanderbilt University report that nearly a quarter of the community-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (CO MRSA BSIs) identified in the state from 2015 through 2017 were related to injection drug use (IDU). During that period, IDU-related cases more than doubled.\n  The study also found that cases linked to drug use were more common among white, uninsured women between the ages of 18 and 49.\n  The findings could help explain why CO MRSA BSI rates rose by more than 37% from 2011 through 2016 in Tennessee, while remaining steady nationwide.\n  Although MRSA BSIs are typically associated with previous healthcare procedures and hospitalization, use of commonly injected drugs like heroin and the synthetic opioid fentanyl is also a known risk factor, because MRSA typically lives on the skin and can easily get into the bloodstream, especially if users don't clean their skin or are reusing needles. And in Tennessee, as in other states, opioid abuse in recent years has shifted from prescription opioids to heroin and fentanyl.\n  \"If you are injecting anything through your skin directly into the bloodstream, that is a prime opportunity to introduce bacteria into your bloodstream, especially if you are not using safe injection practices,\" said lead study author Meghana Parikh, VMD, MPH, an epidemiologist with the Tennessee Department of Health.\nAn alarming trend  To explore what might be behind the rise in CO MRSA BSI cases across the state, Parikh and her colleagues used the National Healthcare Safety Network database and the Tennessee Hospital Discharge Data System to identify MRSA BSIs diagnosed in patients over the age of 13 and to further characterize the demographics and clinical aspects of those cases.\n  Cases were identified as IDU-related if a hospital visit in the 6 months before or after the MRSA BSI diagnosis contained a diagnostic code for drug use. Cases were classified as community-onset if the culture was obtained on or before the third day of hospitalization.\n  Overall, the team identified 7,646 MRSA BSI cases from January 2015 through December 2017, and found a 17.7% increase in cases over the 2-year period (from 2,333 in 2015 to 2,746 in 2017).\n  Nearly 90% of the cases were community-onset, with 57% diagnosed in the emergency department. IDU-related cases represented 24.1% of the overall cases, and rose from 375 in 2015 to 821 in 2017\u2014a 118% increase. IDU-related cases diagnosed in the emergency department rose by nearly 200%.\n  \"That was incredibly alarming to us,\" Parikh said.\n  Analysis of demographic characteristics among the CO MRSA BSI patients revealed that the median age of IDU-related BSIs was 40 years (versus 63 for non-IDU-related cases), and that 69.7% of the IDU-related cases occurred in 18- to 49-year-olds. Just over half of the IDU-related cases were women, and 88.9% were white. Roughly a third were uninsured.\n  \"Our IDU-related patients tend to be much younger, they tend to be more often white, and also uninsured,\" Parikh said. \"Those are the demographics that seemed to really jump out at us.\"\n  The prevalence of endocarditis, hepatitis C, and skin and other soft-tissue infections\u2014conditions that tend to be associated with injection drug use\u2014was also significantly higher than in non-IDU-related cases. And more than one additional IDU-related diagnosis was found in 84.2% of IDU-related MRSA BSI cases.\nChanging demographics  These findings are significant, Parikh said, because they represent a shift in the demographics typically associated with MRSA BSIs, which are the most dangerous type of staph infection and can cause severe illness and death. Historically, most MRSA BSI cases have been hospital-onset, occurring in older inpatients with multiple comorbidities not related to drug use.\n  But the types of patients identified in the study, and the high prevalence of community-onset infections, might signify that hospitals need to approach MRSA BSI prevention and treatment differently.\n  Over the past two decades, prevention and treatment strategies have focused on hospital-onset MRSA infections, and those strategies have had an impact. According to a March 2019 CDC report, hospital-onset MRSA BSIs fell by 17.1% a year from 2005 through 2012, before levelling off from 2013 through 2016. Community-onset MRSA BSIs have declined slower, however, while methicillin-susceptible S aureus BSIs have climbed. CDC officials suggested at the time of the report that these trends could be linked to the nationwide opioid epidemic.\n  At the very least, Parikh believes the findings of the study can help heighten awareness among emergency department clinicians that these younger, female MRSA BSI patients may be injection drug users.\n  \"We're suggesting that maybe if we're seeing more and more people coming into the emergency department with MRSA BSI, and they tend to be younger females, and also white, that maybe we also need to be looking at these other injection drug use\u2013related events as well,\" she said. \n  The fact that CO MRSA BSI patients are more likely to be uninsured, Parikh and her colleagues write in the study, could also have implications for follow-up care, because those patients may be less likely to afford follow-up treatment.\n  \"We need to be considering how we can follow up with them better,\" she said.\n  In addition, Parikh suggested that these findings could start a conversation about the role that hospitals can play in helping opioid addicts get the treatment they need. She noted that previous studies have found that interventions like medication-assisted therapy and screening and referral to treatment can be effective in acute-care settings but have been underused. \n  \"Maybe this paper could be a conversation starter to see if there's a way that we can incorporate addiction treatment more into our acute-care settings,\" she said.\nSee also:\n  Feb 12 Emerg Infect Dis study\n  Mar 5, 2019, CIDRAP News story \"CDC: Progress stalled against staph, MRSA infections\"",

The earliest human infections had occurred by early December 2019, and a large wet market in central Wuhan was linked to most, but not all, of the initial cases [2]. While evidence from the initial outbreak investigations seemed to suggest that 2019-nCoV could not easily spread between humans [3], it is now very clear that infections have been spreading from person to person [2]. We recently estimated that more than 75,000 infections may have occurred in Wuhan as at 25 January 2020 [4], and increasing numbers of infections continue to be detected in other cities in mainland China and around the world. A number of important characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection have already been identified, but in order to calibrate public health responses we need improved information on transmission dynamics, severity of the disease, immunity, and the impact of control and mitigation measures that have been applied to date.\n\n\n     Transmission dynamics\n  Go to section...\n\n\n\n  Infections with 2019-nCoV can spread from person to person, and in the earliest phase of the outbreak the basic reproductive number was estimated to be around 2.2, assuming a mean serial interval of 7.5 days [2]. The serial interval was not precisely estimated, and a potentially shorter mean serial interval would have corresponded to a slightly lower basic reproductive number. Control measures and changes in population behaviour later in January should have reduced the effective reproductive number. However, it is too early to estimate whether the effective reproductive number has been reduced to below the critical threshold of 1 because cases currently being detected and reported would have mostly been infected in mid- to late-January. Average delays between infection and illness onset have been estimated at around 5\u20136 days, with an upper limit of around 11-14 days [2,5], and delays from illness onset to laboratory confirmation added a further 10 days on average [2].\n  Chains of transmission have now been reported in a number of locations outside of mainland China. Within the coming days or weeks it will become clear whether sustained local transmission has been occurring in other cities outside of Hubei province in China, or in other countries. If sustained transmission does occur in other locations, it would be valuable to determine whether there is variation in transmissibility by location, for example because of different behaviours or control measures, or because of different environmental conditions. To address the latter, virus survival studies can be done in the laboratory to confirm whether there are preferred ranges of temperature or humidity for 2019-nCoV transmission to occur.\n  In an analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases of infection, 73% of cases with illness onset between 12 and 22 January reported no exposure to either a wet market or another person with symptoms of a respiratory illness [2]. The lack of reported exposure to another ill person could be attributed to lack of awareness or recall bias, but China\u2019s health minister publicly warned that pre-symptomatic transmission could be occurring [6]. Determining the extent to which asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission might be occurring is an urgent priority, because it has direct implications for public health and hospital infection control. Data on viral shedding dynamics could help in assessing duration of infectiousness. For severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), infectivity peaked at around 10 days after illness onset [7], consistent with the peak in viral load at around that time [8]. This allowed control of the SARS epidemic through prompt detection of cases and strict isolation. For influenza virus infections, virus shedding is highest on the day of illness onset and relatively higher from shortly before symptom onset until a few days after onset [9]. To date, transmission patterns of 2019-nCoV appear more similar to influenza, with contagiousness occurring around the time of symptom onset, rather than SARS.\n  Transmission of respiratory viruses generally happens through large respiratory droplets, but some respiratory viruses can spread through fine particle aerosols [10], and indirect transmission via fomites can also play a role. Coronaviruses can also infect the human gastrointestinal tract [11,12], and faecal-oral transmission might also play a role in this instance. The SARS-CoV superspreading event at Amoy Gardens where more than 300 cases were infected was attributed to faecal-oral, then airborne, spread through pressure differentials between contaminated effluent pipes, bathroom floor drains and flushing toilets [13]. The first large identifiable superspreading event during the present 2019-nCoV outbreak has apparently taken place on the Diamond Princess cruise liner quarantined off the coast of Yokohama, Japan, with at least 130 passengers tested positive for 2019-nCoV as at 10 February 2020 [14]. Identifying which modes are important for 2019-nCoV transmission would inform the importance of personal protective measures such as face masks (and specifically which types) and hand hygiene.\n\n\n     Disease severity and immunity\n  Go to section...\n\n\n\n  The first human infections were identified through a surveillance system for pneumonia of unknown aetiology, and all of the earliest infections therefore had pneumonia. It is well established that some infections can be severe, particularly in older adults with underlying medical conditions [15,16], but based on the generally mild clinical presentation of 2019-nCoV cases detected outside China, it appears that there could be many more mild infections than severe infections. Determining the spectrum of clinical manifestations of 2019-nCoV infections is perhaps the most urgent research priority, because it determines the strength of public health response required. If the seriousness of infection is similar to the 1918/19 Spanish influenza, and therefore at the upper end of severity scales in influenza pandemic plans, the same responses would be warranted for 2019-nCoV as for the most severe influenza pandemics. If, however, the seriousness of infection is similar to seasonal influenza, especially during milder seasons, mitigation measures could be tuned accordingly.\n  Beyond a robust assessment of overall severity, it is also important to determine high risk groups. Infections would likely be more severe in older adults, obese individuals or those with underlying medical conditions, but there have not yet been reports of severity of infections in pregnant women, and very few cases have been reported in children [2].\n  Those under 18 years are a critical group to study in order to tease out the relative roles of susceptibility vs severity as possible underlying causes for the very rare recorded instances of infection in this age group. Are children protected from infection or do they not fall ill after infection? If they are naturally immune, which is unlikely, we should understand why; otherwise, even if they do not show symptoms, it is important to know if they shed the virus. Obviously, the question about virus shedding of those being infected but asymptomatic leads to the crucial question of infectivity. Answers to these questions are especially pertinent as basis for decisions on school closure as a social distancing intervention, which can be hugely disruptive not only for students but also because of its knock-on effect for child care and parental duties. Very few children have been confirmed 2019-nCoV cases so far but that does not necessarily mean that they are less susceptible or that they could not be latent carriers. Serosurveys in affected locations could inform this, in addition to truly assessing the clinical severity spectrum.\n  Another question on susceptibility is regarding whether 2019-nCoV infection confers neutralising immunity, usually but not always, indicated by the presence of neutralising antibodies in convalescent sera. Some experts already questioned whether the 2019-nCoV may behave similarly to MERS-CoV in cases exhibiting mild symptoms without eliciting neutralising antibodies [17]. A separate question pertains to the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection or of disease [18,19]. If either of these were to be relevant, the transmission dynamics could become more complex.\n\n\n     Control and mitigation measures\n  Go to section...\n\n\n\n  A wide range of control measures can be considered to contain or mitigate an emerging infection such as 2019-nCoV. Internationally, the past week has seen an increasing number of countries issue travel advisories or outright entry bans on persons from Hubei province or China as a whole, as well as substantial cuts in flights to and from affected areas out of commercial considerations. Evaluation of these mobility restrictions can confirm their potential effectiveness in delaying local epidemics [20], and can also inform when as well as how to lift these restrictions.\n  If and when local transmission begins in a particular location, a variety of community mitigation measures can be implemented by health authorities to reduce transmission and thus reduce the growth rate of an epidemic, reduce the height of the epidemic peak and the peak demand on healthcare services, as well as reduce the total number of infected persons [21]. A number of social distancing measures have already been implemented in Chinese cities in the past few weeks including school and workplace closures. It should now be an urgent priority to quantify the effects of these measures and specifically whether they can reduce the effective reproductive number below 1, because this will guide the response strategies in other locations. During the 1918/19 influenza pandemic, cities in the United States, which implemented the most aggressive and sustained community measures were the most successful ones in mitigating the impact of that pandemic [22].\n  Similarly to international travel interventions, local social distancing measures should be assessed for their impact and when they could be safely discontinued, albeit in a coordinated and deliberate manner across China such that recrudescence in the epidemic curve is minimised. Mobile telephony global positioning system (GPS) data and location services data from social media providers such as Baidu and Tencent in China could become the first occasion when these data inform outbreak control in real time.\n  At the individual level, surgical face masks have often been a particularly visible image from affected cities in China. Face masks are essential components of personal protective equipment in healthcare settings, and should be recommended for ill persons in the community or for those who care for ill persons. However, there is now a shortage of supply of masks in China and elsewhere, and debates are ongoing about their protective value for uninfected persons in the general community.\n  The Table summarises research gaps to guide the public health response identified.\n    Table.

Establishing robust estimates of the clinical severity of infections is probably the most pressing, because flattening out the surge in hospital admissions would be essential if there is a danger of hospitals becoming overwhelmed with patients who require inpatient care, not only for those infected with 2019-nCoV but also for urgent acute care of patients with other conditions including those scheduled for procedures and operations. In addressing the research gaps identified here, there is a need for strong collaboration of a competent corps of epidemiological scientists and public health workers who have the flexibility to cope with the surge capacity required, as well as support from laboratories that can deliver on the ever rising demand for diagnostic tests for 2019-nCoV and related sequelae. The readiness survey by Reusken et al. in this issue of Eurosurveillance testifies to the rapid response and capabilities of laboratories across Europe should the outbreak originating in Wuhan reach this continent [23].\n  In the medium term, we look towards the identification of efficacious pharmaceutical agents to prevent and treat what may likely become an endemic infection globally. Beyond the first year, one interesting possibility in the longer term, perhaps borne of wishful hope, is that after the first few epidemic waves, the subsequent endemic re-infections could be of milder severity. Particularly if children are being infected and are developing immunity hereafter, 2019-nCoV could optimistically become the fifth human coronavirus causing the common cold.\n\nhttps://www.eurosurveillance.org/con...#html_fulltext",

Coronaviruses, Electron Micrograph\nBackgroundOn December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China.1 Illnesses have since been linked to a previously unidentified strain of coronavirus, designated 2019 Novel Coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV. As of February 7, 2020, tens of thousands of people have been infected and over 500 have died, mostly in China.2 The disease has spread to several other countries, including the United States.\n\nOn January 30, 2020, the Emergency Committee convened by the WHO Director-General declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).3 The next day, on January 31, 2020, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency pursuant to Public Health Service Act (PHSA) Section 319, retroactively dated to January 27, 2020.4\n\nAs the scope of the epidemic widens in China, as of early February, U.S health officials continue to state that the immediate health risk from the new virus to the general American public is low.5 With the situation rapidly changing, both WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) post frequent updates.6\n\nThis report discusses selected actions taken by the federal government to quell the introduction and spread of 2019-nCoV in the United States. The HHS Secretary has taken several specific actions to address the 2019-nCoV threat. While some of these actions are based in generally applicable authorities of the Secretary, other authorities may be contingent upon the Secretary or another federal official making a determination or declaration, specific to that authority, regarding the existence of a public health emergency or threat. Each of the actions taken by the Secretary, its statutory basis, and any distinct declarations and determinations supporting the action is presented in this report.\n\nAdditional CRS products about this outbreak may be found on the \"2019 Novel Coronavirus\" Hot Topics tab at www.crs.gov/.

Experts do not know the origin of 2019-nCoV, though genetic analysis and other features suggest an animal source.8\n\nFigure 1. Coronaviruses, Electron Micrograph\n\n\n\nSource: CDC Public Health Image Library: https://phil.cdc.gov/Details.aspx?pid=10270.\n\nNote: Surface projections on the viral envelope of a poultry coronavirus form the halo or \"corona\" that gives this virus group its name.\n\n\n\n\nHealth officials and researchers are still learning about 2019-nCoV. According to CDC, 2019-nCoV typically causes respiratory infections characterized by a fever, cough, and sometimes breathing difficulty\u2014a suite of symptoms that is common during influenza season.9 Features that have yet to be clarified include routes of transmission (e.g., through the air, from contaminated surfaces); the incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms); and whether an infected person without symptoms can transmit infection.10 Although it was first reported that 2019-nCoV infections resulted from an animal contact, Chinese officials confirmed person-to-person transmission on January 21, 2020.11 Chinese officials have also reported transmission of the virus from asymptomatic patients.12 However, this finding has yet to be confirmed by U.S. and international health officials and other experts. While WHO and other health experts acknowledge transmission among asymptomatic individuals is possible, scientists agree that asymptomatic transmission is unlikely to be a driver of the outbreak.13\n\nAt this time no specific treatment or preventive vaccine exists for 2019-nCoV infections. Care for patients is supportive: maintaining hydration, preventing secondary infections, and providing respiratory support, such as use of a ventilator, if needed.14Domestic ResponseIn the United States, communicable disease control involves collaboration among federal agencies, state health departments, and international partners. Authority to compel isolation (for sick patients), quarantine (for healthy exposed persons), and disease reporting generally rests in state law.15 The HHS Secretary and, by delegation, CDC have broad authority to assist in the control of communicable diseases through international cooperation, federal-state cooperation, and public health emergency response activities.16 In addition, CDC (by delegation) has explicit authority to detain, examine, and release persons arriving into the United States, and traveling between states, who are suspected of having a communicable disease.17 Other authorities, such as those in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA, P.L. 82-414), allow for other actions relevant to communicable disease control, such as travel restrictions.18\n\nThe use of federal and state disease control authorities and other key actions taken in response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak are discussed below. These activities of federal agencies in collaboration with state and local governments include, among others (1) investigation of 2019-nCoV cases and infection control measures in the community, (2) travel restrictions and/or quarantine requirements on certain travelers who have recently visited China, (3) medical countermeasure development, and (4) health system preparedness. Federal agencies involved include several HHS agencies, such as CDC, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in collaboration with other agencies such as the U.S. Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Investigation and Control of 2019-nCoV Cases in the CommunityTo curb the spread of 2019-nCoV cases in the community, state, tribal, and local health departments, with support from CDC, work to identify cases, investigate the possible spread of disease, and take infection control measures.\n\nCase identification begins with testing for 2019-nCoV. CDC urges clinicians to consider a patient's travel and/or contact history and a 14-day incubation period when deciding whether to inform health departments and obtain patient specimens (e.g., mucus, urine) for 2019-nCoV testing. Health care providers are urged to report possible cases to state, tribal, and/or local health departments, which then report to CDC.19\n\nCDC has developed a diagnostic test for the 2019-nCoV virus and initially performed all domestic testing on suspected patients.20 On February 5, 2020, CDC announced that it would begin distributing test kits to state and local laboratories, following an authorization from the FDA (see the \"Medical Countermeasures\" section for more details).21 CDC has been facilitating the collection and transport of specimens until the diagnostic test is made locally available.22\n\nOnce a patient is reported and in the process of having specimens tested, he or she is considered a patient under investigation (PUI) for 2019-nCoV. CDC has developed guidelines for isolation and other precautions for PUIs (including potential PUIs) or those receiving supportive care for 2019-nCoV infection in healthcare settings.23 A key goal of the guidelines is the prevention of disease transmission to health care workers, who may be exposed through high-risk procedures, such as maintaining an ill patient on a ventilator.24\n\nDisease investigation for confirmed cases involves contact tracing\u2014identifying and evaluating individuals who had contact with the patient to determine if transmission has occurred. These investigations are generally conducted by state, tribal, and local health officials, often with support and technical assistance from CDC.25 As of February 3, 2020, CDC has reported two U.S. cases of person-to-person transmission of 2019-nCoV among close household contacts and has indicated that it expects to find additional cases of person-to-person transmission.26\n\nAs of February 3, 2020, CDC reported that it had \"deployed multidisciplinary teams to Washington, Illinois, California, and Arizona to assist health departments with clinical management, contact tracing, and communications.\"27 In addition, the Public Health Emergency Declaration by Secretary Azar, pursuant to PHSA Section 319, gives state, local, and tribal health departments more flexibility to reassign personnel to respond to 2019-nCoV if their salaries are funded in whole or in part by PHSA authorized programs.28Travel Restrictions and Quarantine Requirements Restrictions and Requirements in EffectCDC and the U.S Department of State have issued advisories to avoid unnecessary travel to China, including a rare Level 4 advisory from the State Department to avoid all travel to China.29 In addition, the Trump Administration has imposed entry restrictions and quarantine requirements in response to the entry of individuals who may pose a risk of introducing the 2019 Novel Coronavirus into the United States.\n\nWith respect to entry restrictions, President Trump issued a proclamation on January 31, 2020, that suspends the entry of any foreign national who has been in China within the prior 14 days, subject to some exceptions.30 The exceptions cover lawful permanent residents (LPRs), most immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and LPRs, and some other groups.31 The proclamation directs the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish procedures for implementing and enforcing the entry restrictions, which by the terms of the proclamation took effect at 5:00 p.m. (EST) on February 2, 2020. For statutory authority, the proclamation relies principally upon Section 212(f) of the INA.32 That statute authorizes the President \"to suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens\" whose entry he \"finds ... would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\"33 The Supreme Court has held that Section 212(f) \"exudes deference to the President\" and gives him mostly unfettered discretion to decide \"when to suspend entry,\" \"whose entry to suspend,\" \"for how long,\" and \"on what conditions.\"34 The presidential proclamation is in effect until terminated by the President.35 The proclamation also directs the HHS Secretary to \"recommend that the President continue, modify, or terminate this proclamation.\"36 Such recommendation is required \"no more than 15 days after the date of this order and every 15 days thereafter.\"37\n\nQuarantine requirements also went into effect on February 2, 2020, according to a DHS announcement.38 All persons, including U.S. nationals, LPRs, and their immediate families who arrive in the United States within 14 days after having been in China are to arrive and be screened at one of 11 designated arrival airports, and such persons may be subject to mandatory quarantine, pursuant to the standing quarantine authorities of the HHS Secretary under PHSA Section 361.39 Persons showing symptoms of illness are to be evaluated by CDC staff to determine if they should be taken to a hospital for medical evaluation and to get care as needed.40 Asymptomatic persons are generally to be held under federal quarantine for up to 14 days if they have traveled from China's Hubei province. However, asymptomatic persons who have traveled from other parts of China may be allowed to self-quarantine for 14 days.41\n\nPersonnel from DHS components\u2014namely Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)\u2014are involved in excluding foreign nationals from entry and in assisting CDC personnel with implementation of quarantines for those who are permitted entry under these requirements.42\n\nOf note, in addition to announcing the United States' use of entry restrictions and quarantine authority on January 31, HHS Secretary Azar declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency, pursuant to PHSA Section 319.43 This declaration was not statutorily required for the abovementioned entry restrictions and quarantine requirements to go into effect. Each of these authorities is independent of the others.  Potential Effects of Travel Restrictions on the Spread of 2019-nCoVProposals to restrict the movement of people from affected regions or countries are part of early discussions when novel communicable diseases arise. WHO generally advises against nations imposing travel restrictions on other nations, citing limited evidence of the effectiveness of such measures in controlling outbreaks and the harmful economic effects they have on nations struggling with outbreaks.44 Voluntary movement restrictions are urged instead (see text box below).\n\nIn sum, WHO recommends exit screening\u2014screening for symptoms of illness at the point of departure\u2014as preferable to entry screening (i.e., at the point of arrival) as a means to prevent spread of the disease. Other than interventions for individuals who are found to be ill at exit and/or entry screening, WHO does not recommend broader travel restrictions.\n\nThe effect of travel restrictions on the spread of communicable diseases is considered poorly understood for several reasons, including (1) limited contemporary examples for study; (2) the inherent variability in the natural progression of global disease outbreaks, even those caused by the same pathogen; (3) variation in actions taken by affected countries and restrictions imposed by other countries; and (4) difficulty in accounting for the effects of nongovernmental actions such as event cancellations and airline flight adjustments. In response to the emergence of 2019-nCoV, China imposed sweeping internal movement restrictions,45 a measure that is likely, in later analyses, to obscure or confound any additional transmission-damping effects that the U.S-imposed travel restrictions may achieve.\n\nSeveral studies have examined the potential effects of travel restrictions on disease spread, particularly looking at the global spread of influenza and at the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003. Of note, these analyses sometimes indicated delays in the speed of spread of an outbreak. However, the effect of travel restrictions on the ultimate geographic spread of the outbreak\u2014or on the reduction of overall morbidity or mortality\u2014is unclear, and the evidence base is limited. Some studies have found no effect of travel restrictions on overall morbidity and mortality of infectious disease.46 Others have found that very strict travel restrictions may effectively prevent the spread of disease (i.e., complete border closure) or that travel restrictions might be more effective when combined with other infection control measures, such as quarantine and isolation.47 In particular, compulsory movement restrictions may rely on public support in order to be effective, as well as to avoid discrimination and loss of public trust. Many suggest that if public support and trust are essential in any case, enlisting movement restriction through voluntary measures may be just as effective, with less societal disruption.48\n\nIn explaining the difference between the United States' response to the 2019-nCoV and the 2009 h1n1 pandemic flu, CDC official Nancy Messonnier stated that in the case of 2019-nCoV, the virus was caught early, before it spread around the world, and that CDC is taking advantage of the window of opportunity to slow its spread into the United States.49WHO Current Guidance Regarding International Travel During 2019-nCoV\n\n\t\t\t\"With the information currently available for the novel coronavirus, WHO advises that measures to limit the risk of exportation or importation of the disease should be implemented, without unnecessary restrictions of international traffic\u2026.\n\nAdvice for exit screening in countries or areas with ongoing transmission of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV (currently People's Republic of China): Conduct exit screening at international airports and ports in the affected areas, with the [aim of] early detection of symptomatic travellers for further evaluation and treatment, and thus prevent exportation of the disease, while minimizing interference with international traffic;\u2026.\n\nAdvice for entry screening in countries/areas without transmission of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV that choose to perform entry screening: The evidence from the past outbreaks shows that effectiveness of entry screening [to prevent disease spread] is uncertain\u2026. Temperature screening to detect potential suspect cases at Point of Entry may miss travellers incubating the disease or travellers concealing fever during travel and may require substantial investments. A focused approach targeting direct flights from affected areas could be more effective and less resource demanding\u2026.Currently the northern hemisphere (and China) is in the midst of the winter season when Influenza and other respiratory infections are prevalent. When deciding implementation of entry screening, countries need to take into consideration that travellers with signs and symptoms suggestive of respiratory infection may result from respiratory diseases other than 2019-nCoV, and that their follow-up may impose an additional burden on the health system\u2026.\n\n\t\t\tWHO advises against the application of any restrictions of international traffic based on the information currently available on this event.\"\n\nSource: WHO, \"Updated WHO Advice for International Traffic in Relation to the Outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV,\" January 27, 2020, https://www.who.int/ith/2019-nCoV_ad...al_traffic/en/.\n\n\nMedical Countermeasures Potential Products for Use in the 2019-nCoV ResponseMedical countermeasures (MCMs) are medical products that may be used to treat, prevent, or diagnose conditions associated with emerging infectious diseases or chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) threats. Examples of MCMs include biologics (e.g., vaccines, monoclonal antibodies), drugs (e.g., antimicrobials, antiretrovirals), and devices (e.g., diagnostic tests and personal protective equipment such as gloves, respirators/masks, and gowns).50 FDA regulates MCMs domestically. Currently, there are no FDA-approved MCMs for 2019-nCoV, although FDA has authorized the use of an unapproved diagnostic test via an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).51 Federal agencies, pharmaceutical and biotech companies, nongovernmental organizations, and global regulators have been working to expedite the development and availability of MCMs for 2019-nCoV. Examples of such efforts include the following:Diagnostics. CDC developed the 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.52 On February 4, 2020, FDA issued an EUA, which permits the distribution of the unapproved diagnostic test to and for use by state and local partners.53 (EUAs are described in more detail below). Several federal agencies are working with industry partners to develop rapid diagnostic point-of-care tests for 2019-nCoV, including NIH, particularly through the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID); ASPR, through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA); and the Department of Defense (DOD).54\n\nOn February 5, 2020, BARDA announced an Easy Broad Agency Announcement (EZ-BAA) to solicit applications for development funding of 2019-nCoV molecular diagnostics. The submissions must have a viable plan to meet requirements for the FDA to consider EUA within 12 weeks of an award.55Therapeutics. Research and development into several treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV are underway by federal agencies, international partners, and industry. Drawing from research on the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, NIAID is assessing potential treatment strategies such as antiviral drugs and animal models that can be used to test potential MCMs. In addition, NIAID is developing assays and other research tools to study 2019-nCoV.56 On February 4, 2020, BARDA announced that it would expand an existing collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. to develop monoclonal antibodies that could be used to treat 2019-nCoV infections.57 This partnership would build upon an existing technology used to develop monoclonal antibody therapeutics to treat Ebola and MERS.\n\nScientists in China are testing drugs currently approved for treatment of HIV, influenza (flu), or malaria for potential effectiveness against 2019-nCoV.58 For example, in China, AbbVie's HIV drug Kaletra has been recommended as treatment for patients who have tested positive for 2019-nCoV, while the drug undergoes clinical testing. Johnson & Johnson has reportedly provided its HIV drug Prezcobix to China to test as a potential treatment as well.59 Scientists are also testing many experimental treatments in the research pipeline.60 For example, Gilead is working with health authorities in China to determine whether its experimental antiviral drug Remdesivir can safely and effectively treat 2019-nCoV infections.61Vaccines. At least eight different 2019-nCoV vaccine development initiatives among federal agencies, industry, research institutions, and philanthropies have been announced.62 Of note, the NIAID Vaccine Research Center (VRC) is collaborating with the drug company Moderna and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to advance a vaccine candidate. Moderna expects this vaccine to enter phase 1 clinical testing in the spring of 2020.63 CEPI is also supporting vaccine development by the University of Queensland (Australia) and the drug companies GlaxoSmithKline and Inovio.64 Johnson & Johnson stated that it is mobilizing efforts to develop a possible preventive vaccine candidate against 2019-nCoV.65\nFDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)Clinical testing and the FDA review process typically take several years, so it will take time for MCMs in development to reach the commercial market. However, experimental products may become available in the United States prior to FDA approval pursuant to an EUA. FDA encourages industry and government sponsors (e.g., CDC) to engage with FDA prior to submitting a formal request for an EUA, if possible.\n\nUnder most circumstances, drugs, medical devices, and biologics may be introduced into interstate commerce only if they have been approved, cleared, or licensed by FDA. Under certain circumstances, however, FDA may permit a medical product to be provided to patients outside the standard regulatory framework, including through issuance of an EUA. In the absence of an approved MCM for 2019-nCoV, FDA may enable access to investigational MCMs by issuing an EUA, if the HHS Secretary declares that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of an unapproved product or an unapproved use of an approved medical product.66 The HHS Secretary's declaration must be based on one of four determinations; for example, a determination that there is an actual or significant potential for a public health emergency that affects or has significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad.67 Following the HHS Secretary's declaration, FDA, in consultation with ASPR, NIH, and CDC, may issue an EUA authorizing the emergency use of a specific drug, device, or biologic, provided that certain criteria are met (e.g., that there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product).68\n\nOn February 4, 2020, the HHS Secretary determined that there is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and that involves the 2019-nCoV.69 This determination allowed FDA to assess and ultimately allow the emergency use of the CDC-developed diagnostic test for 2019-nCoV. This emergency determination by the HHS Secretary is distinct from the Public Health Emergency declaration made pursuant to PHSA Section 319.  Health System PreparednessThere is concern that if 2019-nCoV spreads widely in the community, it will overwhelm existing health care system capacity to care for patients and prevent future infections. Given that it is currently flu season, many health care facilities are already at or near patient capacity. The ASPR is the principal advisor to the HHS Secretary on the public health and medical preparedness and response for public health emergencies.70 While 2019-nCoV has not spread widely enough to warrant broad U.S. health system response activities, ASPR and CDC have indicated the following actions in preparation for the potential spread of 2019-nCoV:Capacity assessment and monitoring. ASPR and CDC are projecting the potential long-term impact of 2019-nCoV and assessing the capacity of the health care system to respond to a larger outbreak. A sustained response could engage the Regional Treatment Network for Ebola and Other Special Pathogens, a tiered health system response network developed with funding provided by Congress for response to the Ebola outbreak in 2015.71\nSupply chain management. Both ASPR and CDC have indicated that they are working with health care and industry partners to ensure an adequate supply of medical products needed to contain the outbreak, such as personal protective equipment (PPE; e.g., surgical masks). A chief concern in supply chain management is that many medical products or drugs are manufactured, at least in part, in China, the epicenter of the current outbreak.72\nStrategic National Stockpile (SNS).The SNS, managed by ASPR, provides select medicines and medical supplies during public health emergencies when local supply chains are disrupted.73 ASPR states it is working to ensure the adequacy of SNS supplies to prepare for the possible spread of 2019-nCoV.\nMobilization of healthcare surge capacity. ASPR has indicated that it is working to ensure the availability of additional HHS health care support, such as deployment of the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS), in the event that local health care systems require augmentation to respond to the 2019-nCoV outbreak.74\nResponse FundingCDC and other federal agencies may have the authority needed to respond to the 2019-nCoV epidemic, but their ability to act may be affected by the availability of appropriations. Annual appropriations and standing transfer authority provide the HHS Secretary with some flexibility.75 Upon a declaration of a Public Health Emergency pursuant to PHSA Section 319\u2014which HHS Secretary Azar made on January 31, 2020\u2014HHS may access a Public Health Emergency Fund,76 but the fund does not have an available balance at this time. Separately, funding has generally not been available under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act) for the response to infectious disease outbreaks. As a result, Congress and the President provided supplemental appropriations for the response to the recent Ebola and Zika virus outbreaks in FY2015 and FY2016.77\n\nIn 2018, Congress established an Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund (IDRRRF) for CDC, providing appropriations of $50 million for FY2019 (P.L. 115-245) and $85 million for FY2020 (P.L. 116-94), available until expended.78 These funds may be made available for an infectious disease emergency if the HHS Secretary either (1) declares a Public Health Emergency pursuant PHSA Section 319, or (2) determines that the infectious disease outbreak has significant potential to occur and, if it occurs, the potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens, both domestically and abroad.\n\nBefore HHS Secretary Azar declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency under PHSA Section 319, he issued a determination on January 25, 2020, allowing the allotment of $105 million from the IDRRRF for the 2019-nCoV response.79 Secretary Azar had previously determined that the U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo allowed the use of up to $30 million from the IDRRRF. If both the Ebola and 2019-nCoV amounts are fully used, all funds currently in the IDRRRF would be exhausted.80 On February 2, 2020, HHS reportedly notified Congress of its intention to use the Secretary's standing authority to transfer up to $136 million for 2019-nCoV response efforts, of which $75 million would be made available to CDC, $52 million for ASPR, and $8 million for the HHS Office of Global Affairs.81\n\nCDC has an additional source of emergency support through the CDC Foundation, a 501(c)(3) public charity established by Congress \"to support and carry out activities for the prevention and control of diseases, disorders, injuries, and disabilities, and for promotion of public health.\"82 The CDC Foundation activated its Emergency Response Fund (ERF) to support 2019-nCoV response on January 27, 2020, as requested by CDC.83 Funds have been donated to the ERF for this response by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, among others. Although the support provided by the foundation for outbreak response has been modest compared with supplemental appropriations, the foundation has greater spending flexibility and can sometimes procure response supplies and services more quickly than CDC through federal procurement processes.84\n\nThe trajectory of the 2019-nCoV outbreak is uncertain. If the United States experiences sustained person-to-person transmission of the novel virus in the future, the nation's public health and health care systems could be stretched to respond, and resources mobilized from the IDRRRF, HHS transfer authority, and the CDC Foundation may potentially be insufficient. Some Members of Congress have suggested that the Trump Administration consider a request for supplemental funding.85\n\n\n\nAuthor Contact Information\n\nSarah A.

However, in general, a recipient account may not be increased by more than 3%. Congressional appropriators must be notified in advance of any transfer. Another FY2020 appropriations provision (P.L. 116-94, Division A, Title V, \u00a7514) addresses the Secretary's authority to reprogram funds from one program, project, or activity in a given budget account to a different program, project, or activity within the same budget account.

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "Starting in about 2005, there was a worldwide scare that Influenza H5N1, also known as bird flu, was going to cause a pandemic. At the time, there were a number of online forums established to help understand pandemics and allow people to share ideas about how to prepare for one.\n\nSeveral of these forums included CurEvents, Flutracker, Fluwiki(e),Fluwiki 2, This Blue Marble, and FluTrackers. Of these, only Flutrackers.com is still active as you are reading here. Several of these domain registrations lapsed and were taken over by others. Hopefully, someday, someone will compile a history of these early disease tracking forums and the colorful characters that originated online disease tracking and pandemic preparation in the 21st century.\n\nOne of these people, gsgs, is a member here and has been participating in disease tracking here at FluTrackers since 2006. He copied more than 1900 threads from between 2005 and 2007 from the Fluwiki forum. These threads discuss information about a potential H5N1 pandemic but also have extensive information about home and family preparation for a pandemic circa 2006. Much of it is still relevant today if COVID-19 becomes a worldwide pandemic.\n\nThe link to the Fluwiki threads collected by gsgs can be found at: http://magictour.free.fr/fw/",

Signs and symptoms of COVID-19Based on current evidence, COVID-19 presents with flu-like symptoms including:cough\ndifficulty breathing\na fever (feeling hot or feverish or has measured by a doctor or nurse)\n\nThe current evidence is that most cases appear to be mild. The majority of those that have died in the current outbreak appear to have had pre-existing health conditions or have had weakened immune systems. 2. Case definitionOn 6 February the UK\u2019s Chief Medical Officers agreed on a precautionary basis to expand the clinical case definition for COVID-19 to include:China\nHong Kong\nJapan\nMacau\nMalaysia\nRepublic of Korea\nSingapore\nTaiwan\nThailand\n\nThe UK\u2019s Chief Medical Officers\u2019 advice to passengers who have travelled or passed through (such as transit through an airport) any of these countries in the previous 14 days and who develop flu like symptoms (cough, fever, shortness of breath) should:stay indoors and avoid contact with other people, as you would with the flu\ncall NHS 111 to inform them of recent travel to the country\n\nPlease follow this advice even if symptoms are minor. 3. TransmissionAlthough evidence is still emerging, information to date indicates human-to-human transmission is occurring. Hence, precautions to prevent human-to-human transmission are appropriate for both suspected and confirmed cases (see infection prevention and control guidance). COVID-19 infections have been reported in healthcare workers in China. 3.1 How COVID-19 is caught and spreadSeasonal flu and coronavirus are both spread from person to person by close contact. Some examples of how it can be spread include:large droplets from coughing and or sneezing by an infected person within a short distance (usually one metre or less) of someone\ntouching or shaking the hand of an infected person and then touching your mouth, eyes or nose without first washing your hands\ntouching surfaces or objects (such as door handles) that have become contaminated with the virus and then touching your mouth, eyes or nose without first washing your hands\n\nIt is advisable to check Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and local guidance and advice on avoiding infection during the current outbreak if travelling overseas.\n\nLatest advice from the UK Government is available.\n\nIn practice, it can be difficult to ascertain with any degree of reliability if someone who is asymptomatic has been exposed if they do not report this directly. 4. General precautions 4.1 Possible risk to staffStaff and crew in contact with international passengers (or the general public) are not considered to be at a heightened risk of contracting coronavirus as a result of their work. This means that they are at no greater risk of contracting coronavirus than any other member of the public. 4.2 Taking necessary precautionsThere is currently no vaccine for coronavirus but there are things you can do to help stop coronavirus spreading.\n\nPublic Health England (PHE) recommends that the following general cold and flu precautions are taken to help prevent people from catching and spreading COVID-19:cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze\nput used tissues in the bin straight away\nwash your hands with soap and water often \u2013 use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available\ntry to avoid close contact with people who are unwell\nclean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces\ndo not touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean\n4.3 How long can the virus survive?How long any respiratory virus survives will depend on a number of factors, for example:what surface the virus is on\nwhether it is exposed to sunlight\ndifferences in temperature and humidity\nexposure to cleaning products\n\nUnder most circumstances, the amount of infectious virus on any contaminated surfaces is likely to have decreased significantly by 24 hours, and even more so by 48 hours.\n\nOnce the virus is transferred to hands, it survives for fewer than 5 minutes. Regular cleaning of frequently touched hard surfaces and hands will therefore help to reduce the risk of infection. 4.4 FacemasksStaff are not recommended to wear respiratory masks. They do not provide protection from respiratory viruses. Respiratory masks are only recommended to be worn by symptomatic passengers to reduce the risk of transmitting the infection to other people.\n\nPHE recommends that the best way to reduce any risk of infection is good hygiene and avoiding direct or close contact (closer than 2 metres) with any potentially infected person. Any member of staff who deals with members of the public from behind a screen will be protected from airborne particles.  4.5 Hand hygiene standards to followIf staff are concerned that they may be exposed to risk, they should wash their hands regularly. Washing with water and soap is preferable to wipes and gels as it removes any potential infection directly. Wipes and gels are good alternatives if that\u2019s all you have available. See hand washing guidance. 4.6 Handling post or freightStaff should continue to follow existing risk assessments and safe systems of work. There is no perceived increase in risk for handling post or freight from specified countries. 4.7 If a passenger becomes unwell at a transport hubWhere possible staff should ask if they have recently returned from one (or passed through) any of the areas listed in the COVID-19 case definition in the last 14 days. If they have then, where possible, staff should remove themselves to be at least 2 metres distance from the passenger and call for medical assistance, informing the medical staff that they have been to a specified country in the last 14 days.\n\nIf they have not been to a specified area in the last 14 days, then normal practice should continue. 4.8 Cleaning standardsCoronavirus symptoms are similar to a flu-like illness and include cough, fever, or shortness of breath. Once symptomatic, all surfaces that the passenger has come into contact with must be cleaned including:all surfaces and objects which are visibly contaminated with body fluids\nall potentially contaminated high-contact areas such as toilets, door handles, telephones\nclothing and linen used by the passenger should be set aside pending assessment of the passenger by a healthcare professional\n\nPublic areas where a symptomatic passenger has passed through and spent minimal time in (such as corridors) but which are not visibly contaminated with body fluids do not need to be specially cleaned and disinfected.\n\nFurther advice on environmental cleaning standards for potential COVID-19 contamination is available.  4.9 What staff should do if they think they have been exposed to COVID-19If you think you have been exposed or if you develop symptoms consistent with coronavirus, in England call the NHS 111 helpline or the equivalent in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.\n\nIf overseas, follow your transport company\u2019s arrangements for seeking medical advice. 5. Arrivals into the UK 5.1 MaritimeMaritime Declarations of Health are already required for all ships arriving from a foreign port. If the maritime declaration of health reports any instances of illness, the usual procedures for infectious diseases will be followed.\n\nIn addition, for vessels that arrive with potential cases, PHE\u2019s local Health Protection Team (HPT) will deliver enhanced port health monitoring commensurate with that in place at airports for the passengers and crew on board.\n\nEnhanced monitoring arrangements involve assessing recent travel history; who they have been in contact with and where they are going next, as well as a possible medical assessment. Medical assessments will be carried out by trained medical staff and not by Border Force or other staff.\n\nPassengers and crew will also be given advice on what to do should they develop symptoms later, again consistent with enhanced monitoring arrangements at airports. 5.2 AviationDirect flights to the UK from specified areas are required to provide health announcements to passengers relating to the current COVID-19 outbreak. Flights are also required to provide a general declaration 60 minutes before landing on any passenger health issues or suspected cases. 5.3 International railEurostar runs trains between the UK and France, the Netherlands and Belgium so has no direct links with specified areas. Visitors may fly into Europe from specified areas but then travel around by other modes of transport including Eurostar, however there is no assessment of Eurostar passengers\u2019 recent travel history. Currently Eurostar has no enhanced port health monitoring in place, although this will be kept under review. Performing body or bag searchesPHE recommend that passengers be asked if they have travelled to (or passed through) any of the specified areas in the last 14 days. If they have and feel unwell, then the passenger should be immediately assessed by Port Health staff prior to the search.\n\nFor all well passengers, PHE recommend that staff use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser that contains at least 60% alcohol after each search.  5.4 If a passenger becomes symptomatic on-board a vessel, train or aircraftCooperate with the emergency medical service or public health officials at the relevant port or airport, as far as possible.\n\nKeep your transport company operations centre informed of any requests by the public health officials such as requests for passenger information (except where provided by the passengers themselves) and crew details.\n\nIf the emergency medical services or public health officials are concerned that the ill person may have COVID-19, they are likely to request specific information to assist with the clinical and public health risk assessment, such as:what are the main symptoms of the case?\ndo they have a fever?\nwere they unwell during the journey and if so:what symptoms did they have?\nwere there any episodes of contamination with bodily fluids (including vomit, diarrhoea and blood) of the crew or passengers during the journey or during disembarkation?\nare there any co-passengers? Clarify with them, about both the case and themselves\nhow long the case has been unwell?\nwhat have the symptoms been?\nhave they had a temperature?\nwhere exactly have they come from?\nhave the co-passengers experienced any symptoms, and if so, clarify using the information above\n\nContacts of suspected COVID-19 caseAny contacts of a possible case need to be isolated or quarantined. In practice for passengers who have travelled via airplane, this will include all passengers in the 2 rows in front and behind of where the possible case was sat. 6.

Understanding the cost associated to measles outbreaks can inform cost-of-illness and cost-effectiveness studies of measles and measles prevention. We performed a literature review and identified 10 published studies from 2001-2018 that presented cost estimates from 11 measles outbreaks. Median total costs per measles outbreak were $152,308 (range, $9,862-$1,063,936); median cost per case was $32,805 (range, $7,396-$76,154) and median cost per contact was $223 (range, $81-$746). There was limited data on direct and indirect costs associated with measles. These findings highlight how costly measles outbreaks can be, the value of this information for public health department budgeting, and the importance of more broadly documenting the cost of measles outbreaks.",

Aria Bendix\n\n24 minutes ago Associated PressChinese authorities have started diagnosing coronavirus cases in the Hubei province via CT scans.\nThe scans aren't as thorough as a blood tests, but doctors in Wuhan, where the virus originated, are reportedly running short on test kits.\nTo diagnose the virus, physicians look for white patches called \"ground glass,\" which signal fluid in the lungs.\nAuthorities in China's Hubei province reported a dramatic spike in coronavirus cases on Thursday: 14,840 new cases.\n\nIt was most reported in a single day since the outbreak began in December. The Hubei Health Commission also reported that an additional 242 people had died.\n\nBut the virus didn't suddenly becoming more aggressive \u2014 instead, Hubei officials said they changed the way they count cases. Rather than relying only on blood tests, which are in limited supply and can take take days to yield results, officials have started including diagnoses made via CT scans in their daily case totals. \n\nThe scans are considered less thorough than a blood test, but the New York Times reported last week that doctors in Wuhan, where the virus originated, are running short on test kits.\n\nPatients diagnosed via CT scan \u2014 what Chinese officials call \"clinically diagnosed cases\" \u2014 present symptoms of the virus in their lungs, but either haven't been lab-tested or died before the test could be administered. \nThe latest figures suggest the virus has killed at least 1,370 people and infected more than 60,000 in total. That number is expected to rise significantly as CT scans capture more cases in the coming days.\n\nHere's what physicians look for in the scans.  Normal lungs should appear black on a CT scan.Karan Bunjean/Shutterstock\nIt's common to have small masses of tissue, or lung nodules, that show up as tiny white dots.

She is responsible for the isolation of the first district, which is the place where the eighth hospital of Guangzhou city treats severe and critically ill patients. As of February 12, a total of 13 critically ill patients and more than 20 critically ill patients have been treated. At the same time, she is also carrying out non-stop scientific research on the treatment of new coronary pneumonia.\n\n\u3000\u3000Recently, she accepted an exclusive interview with Nanfang Daily to introduce the treatment of patients with severe and critically ill patients with new coronary pneumonia, and responded to the public's concerns about antiviral drugs for new coronary pneumonia.\n\n\u3000\u3000Keywords critical alert\n\n\u3000\u3000Cytokine storm is most likely induced by hypoxia\n\n\u3000\u3000Nanfang Daily: Why do some patients get worse and some patients get better?\n\n\u3000\u3000Li Yueping: We are conducting research on early and critical illness warning factors and found several very clear early warning factors, namely lymphocyte decline, lactate dehydrogenase increase, D2 polymer increase, continuous oxygenation index decrease, Viremia and so on.\n\n\u3000\u3000In addition, we found that exacerbated patients had had an oxygenation index of only 100-150 mmhg (normal value 400-500 mmhg) for more than 12 hours. Such patients may induce cytokine storms due to hypoxia.\n\n\u3000\u3000Many people have said that cytokine storms are sudden, but according to our daily observations from critical medical experts, cytokine storms are not sudden. It is likely to be induced by hypoxia. The same thing is that many people seem to have mild symptoms, shortness of breath, and respiratory distress are not obvious, but in fact, the oxygenation index has decreased significantly, and CT indicates multiple lung fields.\n\n\u3000\u3000Therefore, in the treatment of new coronary pneumonia, oxygen therapy is very important. Whether it is oxygen inhalation, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, or tracheal intubation, it is necessary to ensure that the patient's oxygen is sufficient. If a patient's oxygen supply can be guaranteed in the early stage, his chance of sudden development of severe illness will be a little smaller. At present, the Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou City has a pressurized central oxygen supply and the protection is adequate.\n\n\u3000\u3000Keywords intensive care\n\n\u3000\u3000Maintain organ function to help patients \"pass\"\n\n\u3000\u3000Nanfang Daily: Which antiviral drugs are currently effective?\n\n\u3000\u3000Li Yueping: Kelizhi, Abidol, Chloroquine, Redecide, these are the antiviral drugs that many people have high hopes for. We started this study on January 28. We set strict entry criteria, exclusion criteria, and observation indicators, as well as blank control groups to observe the efficacy of Abidol and Kelizhi. But so far, neither drug has had very encouraging results.\n\n\u3000\u3000We started the experimental research on chloroquine on February 8. In cooperation with the Zhongshan Fifth Hospital of Zhuhai, we launched a multi-center experimental study on chloroquine against viruses. Cao Bin of Beijing is also conducting a multi-center experiment on Radixivir to observe the antiviral effect. To date, these antivirals have not shown efficacy. From the cell level, to the tissue level, and then to the human level, the effect may be far worse.\n\n\u3000\u3000Nanfang Daily: Is it safe to find effective antiviral drugs?\n\n\u3000\u3000Li Yueping: Antiviral effects are one thing, but severe cases are another. Even with antiviral drugs, can it prevent the disease from progressing to severe cases? Not necessarily, this is related to everyone's immune status and subsequent cytokine storms. Virus testing has turned negative for several of our patients, but his condition has worsened. Even if there are antiviral drugs, they may not be able to completely treat all the critically ill patients.\n\n\u3000\u3000Therefore, in the treatment of new coronary pneumonia, intensive medicine is very important. It is to maintain the function of each organ of the patient to slowly survive the duration of the virus, including the support of the ventilator to the lung, and ECMO (external membrane pulmonary oxygenation). Support for cardiopulmonary function.\n\n\u3000\u3000This time with new coronary pneumonia, the virus lasts a long time, and lung failure takes a long time, and it takes a long time to support it. We now have 3 patients on ECMO. Of the 8 patients who were transferred to the Institute, there were also 3 of them. It has been 10 days. No patient has been successfully taken offline yet. Now we are in a quarantine area and we have gathered the three \"ace soldiers\" of infection, severe illness and breathing, hoping to work together to overcome this disease.\n\n\u3000\u3000Keywords outbreak control...http://news.southcn.com/gd/content/2..._190322421.htm",

Over the past 21 days, officials confirmed 13 new cases, 12 in Beni and 1 in Mabalako, which is also in North Kivu province. Three of those patients died, all in the community, which raised the risk of disease spread.\n  \"Although recent trends of this outbreak, including the small number of weekly cases and limited geographic area affected by EVD are encouraging,\" the WHO said, \"continued vigilance is crucial, particularly for contact identification and follow up, in order to interrupt possible nosocomial transmission linked to traditional practitioner facilities.\"\n  \"The security situation in several EVD-affected health areas remain unstable and unpredictable,\" the WHO added. \"On 8 February, a health centre was attacked in Butembo, destroying equipment and infrastructure. On 8 February 2020, an attack on civilians in Mabalako Health Zone led to a suspension of response activities for 48 hours.\"\n  Since Feb 9, the WHO has logged 2 new cases, 1 on Feb 10 and 1 yesterday. The DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said the case reported yesterday was in Beni. No new cases were reported today, according to the WHO's online dashboard, keeping the outbreak total at 3,432 cases, including 2,249 deaths. Authorities are tracking 461 suspected cases.\nFeb 12 WHO situation report\nFeb 12 CMRE update\nWHO Ebola dashboard\n\nMCR-1 colistin resistance gene identified in Wyoming hospital patient  A urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria carrying the MCR-1 colistin resistance gene was identified in a Wyoming hospital patient in early 2019, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Wyoming Department of Health (WDH) reported today in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). It's the first MCR-1-carrying isolate identified in Wyoming or surrounding states.\n  The patient, who had a history of recurrent UTIs, was admitted to the hospital in mid-December 2018, and admission urine culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing identified the infecting pathogen as carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production. Further testing identified resistance to 16 antibiotics. In early January 2019, the Texas Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network found additional resistance to colistin and identified a plasmid-mediated MCR-1 gene.\n  WDH subsequently began in investigation to determine where the patient might have acquired the organism, but was not able to identify the route of acquisition. The patient had not traveled internationally or been exposed to livestock, but had experience repeated UTIs caused by K pneumoniae and Escherichia coli in the previous 2 years and had been treated with antibiotics. The authors of the case report suggest this could have increased the risk for acquiring antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n  A point-prevalence survey conducted to identify possible transmission of the MCR-1 gene to other patients found six patients who were in the same hospital unit at the same time as the index patient; rectal screening of four of those patients was negative. The patient recovered after receiving appropriate antibiotics and was discharged from the hospital in January 2019.\n  The first US patient carrying MCR-1 was identified in Pennsylvania in July 2016, and since then MCR-1-carrying isolates have been identified in 20 more states. Colistin is considered a last-resort antibiotic.\nFeb 14 MMWR case report\n\nStudy: 3-dose pneumococcal vaccine tops 2-dose regimen in infants  A study today in Pediatrics suggests that children under 1 year old are less likely to suffer pneumococcal disease if they receive three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) than if they get only two doses, but the difference in infection rates has dropped in recent years as pneumococcal strains targeted by vaccines have become less common.\n  Researchers from the CDC, state health departments, and other institutions looked at the rates of invasive pneumococcal disease in children under 5 years from 2001 through 2016, using the CDC's Active Bacterial Core Surveillance data.\n  They note that most countries use a 3-dose PCV schedule, but a 4-dose schedule\u20143 primary doses and 1 booster\u2014is licensed for infants in the United States. The team compared breakthrough disease rates in children receiving 2 or 3 doses, both with and without booster doses (2+1 versus 3+1; 2+0 versus 3+0). Children who received 7-valent and 13-valent PCV (PCV7 and PCV13) doses were included.\n  The researchers found 71 PCV7 and 49 PCV13 breakthrough infections among children who received the schedules studied. PCV13 breakthrough infections were higher in children under 1 year old who received 2 doses (2+0) than in the 3-dose (3+0) group: incidence rates (IRs) per 100,000 were 7.8 versus 0.6. The IR ratio was 12.9, with a 95% confidence interval of 4.1 to 40.4. The results for PCV7 cases were similar.\n  In addition, the study revealed that differences in case numbers between the 2-dose and 3-dose regimens in children under age 1 were greater in 2010 and 2011 (IR for 2+0 group, 18.6; IR for 3+0 group, 1.4) than in 2012 through 2016 (IR for 2+0 group, 3.6; IR for 3+0 group, 0.2).\n  \"Fewer PCV breakthrough infections occurred in the first year of life with 3 primary doses,\" the team concluded. \"Differences in breakthrough infection rates by schedule decreased as vaccine serotypes decreased in circulation.\"\nFeb 13 Pediatrics abstract\n\nVietnam reports two more H5N6 avian flu outbreaks in poultry  Vietnam reported two more outbreaks of H5N6 highly pathogenic avian flu yesterday, a day after four other outbreaks were reported in the northern part of the country, according to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).\n  A total of 1,000 birds were infected and died out of 8,731 susceptible birds on the two affected farms, the OIE said.

It said the classification has allowed doctors to get patients with suspected infections, based on pneumonia findings on radiographic imaging, into appropriate treatment faster.\n  Subtracting the retrospective cases, the NHC's report today reflects 1,820 lab-confirmed cases, down from 2,015 new cases reported yesterday, for an overall total of 59,804 illnesses. For severe cases, 174 were subtracted from the total, putting the current number at 8,030. And 254 more deaths were reported, lifting the outbreak's fatality count to 1,367.\n  So far, 5,911 people have been discharged from the hospital.\n  At a media briefing today, Mike Ryan, MD, director of the WHO's health emergencies program, emphasized that the addition of the clinically diagnosed illnesses doesn't reflect a surge of new cases. He said the clinical case definition for Hubei province allowed doctors to report cases, initiate patient care, and start the public health response more quickly, without having to wait for lab confirmation.\n  He said the WHO is waiting for details on how the cases were spread across the earlier outbreak weeks and that it will continue to track both lab-confirmed and clinically confirmed cases.\nTests positive for 2 more US evacuees  Elsewhere, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported two more COVID-19 infections in quarantined evacuees from Hubei province, raising the nation's total to 15.\n  Last night, the CDC said it confirmed a COVID-19 illness in a person who is part of a quarantined group that arrived in California on Feb 7, the second to be confirmed at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. It said the two patients arrived on different planes and were housed in separate facilities, and there are no epidemiologic links between them.\n  Chris Braden, MD, who leads the CDC's on-site team, said in a statement that there is no sign of human-to-human spread at the facility, but the CDC will conduct contact tracing as part of its response.\n  Today, the CDC confirmed another similar case, but involving a person quarantined at JBSA-Lackland Air Force Base in Texas after returning on a charter flight on Feb 7. The individual is the first to experience symptoms at the Texas facility and has been isolated and is receiving care at a nearby designated hospital.\n  The CDC warned that it expects more cases in the coming days and weeks, including those among people who recently returned from Wuhan, the city in Hubei province that has been hit the hardest. An earlier group of 195 evacuees completed their quarantine period and have returned to their communities, but 600 are still in federal quarantine and are being closely monitored.\nJapan reports death, 44 sick on cruise ship  Elsewhere, Japan reported a death in one of four newly reported local cases, marking the second death outside of China. The health ministry said in a statement that the woman who died is in her 80s and is from Kanagawa prefecture. She first sought care on Jan 28 and was hospitalized when her condition worsened.\n  One of the other local cases today involves a 70-year-old man who works as a taxi driver in Tokyo, and an investigation into the source of his illness is under way. The others include a man in his 50s from Wakayama prefecture and a man in his 20s from Chiba prefecture. Japan now has 30 COVID-19 cases.\n  Also today the country reported that 44 more COVID-19 cases have been confirmed on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, bringing the overall total to 218. The boat has been quarantined in Yokohama port since Feb 3.\nWesterdam cruise ship arrives in Cambodia  Meanwhile, the Westerdam cruise ship today arrived in Cambodia, after it was turned away by four countries over fears of COVID-19.\n  At today's WHO media briefing, Ryan said some of the passengers had mild upper respiratory symptoms and were still on board for testing.\n  Later in the day, WHO's Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said on Twitter that 20 passengers tested negative for the virus, and he thanked Cambodia's health ministry and government for their act of global solidarity.\n  The boat was carrying 2,257 people, which included 802 crew members.\nMore local spread in Singapore, Vietnam  Singapore's health ministry confirmed 8 more cases today, lifting its total to 58. Four of the patients are linked to a church cluster, 2 are Bangladeshi citizens linked to a work cluster, 1 is a family member of an earlier confirmed patient, and the exposure for another is still under investigation.\n  Vietnam's health ministry today reported 1 more case, which involves the father of a previously confirmed case. The country has now confirmed 16 COVID-19 infections.\n  The WHO said in its latest daily situation report that over the past 24 hours it has receive reports of 6 more cases outside of China, raising the total to 447 from 24 countries.\nPromising remdesivir findings in monkeys  A preclinical trial of remdesivir, meanwhile, an antiviral drug being studied in China's outbreak that has been used on a compassionate basis for some COVID-19 patients, showed promising results in rhesus monkeys against a related coronavirus, a team from the US National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) reported today in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences (PNAS).\n  Scientists experimentally infected the treatment-group monkeys with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which is closely related to the virus that causes COVID-19.\n  The drug prevented disease when given before infection and improved the conditions of monkeys who received it after infection, when compared with the untreated control group. After receiving the drug either 24 hours before infection or 12 hours after infection, the animals were observed for 6 days.\n  All control animals who didn't receive remdesivir showed signs of disease. Those treated before infection had no symptoms and lower virus replication levels in the lungs. For monkey treated after infection, illnesses were less severe than controls, lung levels of virus were lower, and lung damage wasn't as severe.\n  The team concluded that the findings support further clinical trials for both MERS-CoV and COVID-19.\n  Made by Gilead, remdesivir showed in vitro and in vivo activity against other coronaviruses such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus and MERS-CoV. Though not licensed or approved, Gilead has provided it for emergency use in a few COVID-19 patients, including at least one in the United States.\nSee also:\n  Feb 13 China NHC statement\n  Feb 12 CDC statement on 14th case\n  Feb 13 CDC statement on 15th case\n  Feb 13 Japanese health ministry statement on ship infections\n  Feb 13 Japanese health ministry statement on fatal case\n  Feb 13 Japanese health ministry statement on Tokyo taxi driver case\n  Feb 13 Japanese health ministry statement on Wakayama prefecture case\n  Feb 13 Japanese health ministry statement on Chiba prefecture case\n  Feb 13 Tedros tweet\n  Feb 13 Singapore health ministry statement\n  Feb 13 Vietnamese health ministry information\n  Feb 13 PNAS study\n  Feb 13 NIAID press release on the study",

Routine testing \u2018showed no COVID-19 activity\u2019Speaking to journalists, Dr. Ryan explained that routine winter testing of patients with chest ailments in hospitals in China, Singapore and Hong Kong had not indicated widespread COVID-19 transmission.\n\n\u201cIn emergency rooms and as part of normal winter respiratory disease surveillance, they\u2019ve been actively testing thousands of samples that are not suspect cases of COVID,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re just not seeing COVID activity amongst those samples, and that would give an indication that the iceberg may not be that great \u2013 [but] it\u2019s not a guarantee.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, fears that only a fraction of cases were being detected were \u201cas valid as speculations in the other direction\u201d, Dr. Ryan insisted, before adding that no specific treatments existed for patients, beyond \u201cstandard antivirals\u201d used for previous coronavirus outbreaks, such as during the SARS epidemic in 2003.\n\nVaccines and new drugs would take a long time and require a huge investment in of hundreds of millions of dollars, Dr. Ryan explained, before urging public and private investment to spread the risk. Jump in infections explained by new protocolDr. Ryan said that the latest data showing a jump in infections reflects a change in how cases are being diagnosed and reported by Chinese authorities.\n\nFrom now on in Hubei province only, trained medical professionals are authorized to classify a suspected case of COVID-19 as a clinically diagnosed case based on chest imaging, rather than having to have a laboratory confirmation, the WHO official said.\n\n\u201cThis allows clinicians to move and report cases more quickly, not having to wait for lab confirmation, which means that people get clinical care more quickly, and also allows public health responses in terms of contact tracing and other important public health measures to be initiated.\u201d Cambodian cruise ship gesture welcomedConfirmation of the latest infection tally comes after WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed the Cambodian authorities\u2019 decision to allow a cruise ship to dock there.\n\nIt had been reportedly denied entry elsewhere because of fears that its passengers may have contracted the virus.\n\n\u201cPeople with mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms are being treated on the Westerdam by cruise doctors & 20 of those are being tested for COVID19,\u201d the WHO chief tweeted earlier in the day.\n\nHe noted that the samples have been transported to laboratories via helicopter at Sihanoukville Seaport and that all passengers and crew remain on board in quarantine.\n\nThree cruise ships had either experienced delayed port clearance or been denied entry to ports. Often, said the WHO chief, without an evidence-based risk assessment.\n\n\u201cWHO stands ready to provide any additional support to the Government, especially in building preparedness capacities for COVID19,\u201d he added, before noting that he was \u201cdeeply grateful to the Government, particularly Prime Minister Hun Sen\u201d, for their gesture.\n\nIn an earlier tweet, the he also thanked Germany\u2019s health authorities after Health Minister Jens Spahn called for more support from fellow European Union members to fight the epidemic.\n\nTo date, Germany has reportedly identified 16 cases of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cI fully agree agree that we need to work as one to keep the world safe from this virus,\u201d WHO chief tweeted.\n\nhttps://news.un.org/en/story/2020/02/1057331",

Cowling, and Lauren Ancel Meyers \nAuthor affiliations: University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA (Z. Du, L.A. Meyers); Institut Pasteur, Paris, France (L. Wang, S.

Meyers)\n\nSuggested citation for this article AbstractOn January 23, 2020, China quarantined Wuhan to contain 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We estimated the probability of transportation of COVID-19 from Wuhan to 369 other cities in China before the quarantine. Expected COVID-19 risk is >50% in 130 (95% CI 89\u2013190) cities and >99% in the 4 largest metropolitan areas.\n\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus, since named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, emerged in Wuhan, China (1), causing a respiratory illness that the World Health Organization has named 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (2). By January 31, 2020, a total of 192 fatalities and 3,215 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported in Wuhan; 8,576 additional cases were spread across >300 cities in mainland China, and 127 exported cases were reported in 23 countries spanning Asia, Europe, Oceania, and North America. The rapid global expansion, rising fatalities, unknown animal reservoir, and evidence of person-to-person transmission potential (3,4) initially resembled the 2003 SARS epidemic and raised concerns about global spread.\n\nOn January 22, 2020, China announced a travel quarantine of Wuhan and by January 30 expanded the radius to include 16 cities, encompassing a population of 45 million. At the time of the quarantine, China was already 2 weeks into the 40-day Spring Festival, during which residents and visitors make several billion trips throughout China to celebrate the Lunar New Year (5). Considering the timing of exported COVID-2019 cases reported outside of China, we estimate that only 8.95% (95% credibility interval [CrI] 2.22%\u201328.72%) of persons infected in Wuhan by January 12 might have had COVID-19 confirmed by January 22. By limiting our estimate to infections occurring \u226510 days before the quarantine, we account for an \u22485\u20136-day incubation period and 4\u20135 days between symptom onset and case detection (Appendix) (2\u20134,6). The low detection rate coupled with an average lag of 10 days between infection and detection (7) suggest that newly infected persons who traveled out of Wuhan just before the quarantine might have remained infectious and undetected in dozens of cities in China for days to weeks. Moreover, these silent importations already might have seeded sustained outbreaks that were not immediately apparent.\n\nWe estimated the probability of transportation of infectious COVID-2019 cases from Wuhan to cities throughout China before January 23 by using a simple model of exponential growth coupled with a stochastic model of human mobility among 369 cities in China (Appendix). Given that \u224898% of all trips taken during this period were made by train or car, our analysis of air, rail, and road travel data yields more granular risk estimates than possible with air passenger data alone (8).\n\n\nFigure. Risks for transportation of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from Wuhan, China, before a quarantine was imposed on January 23, 2020. A) Daily travel volume to and from Wuhan, given as...\n\nBy fitting our epidemiologic model to data on the first 19 cases reported outside of China, we estimate an epidemic doubling time of 7.31 days (95% CrI 6.26\u20139.66 days) and a cumulative total of 12,400 (95% CrI 3,112\u201358,465) infections in Wuhan by January 22 (Appendix). Both estimates are consistent with a similar epidemiologic analysis of the first 425 cases confirmed in Wuhan (4). Assuming these rates of early epidemic growth, we estimate that 130 cities in China have a >50% chance of having a COVID-2019 case imported from Wuhan in the 3 weeks preceding the quarantine (Figure). By January 26, a total of 107 of these 130 high-risk cities had reported cases. However, 23 had not, including 5 cities with importation probabilities >99% and populations >2 million: Bazhong, Fushun, Laibin, Ziyang, and Chuxiong.\n\nUnder our lower bound estimate of 6.26 days for the doubling time, 190/369 cities lie above the 50% threshold for importation. Our risk assessment identified several cities throughout China likely to be harboring yet undetected cases of COVID-19 a week after the quarantine, suggesting that early 2020 ground and rail travel seeded cases far beyond the Wuhan region under quarantine.\n\nOur conclusions are based on several key assumptions. To design our mobility model, we used data from Tencent (https://heat.qq.comExternal Link), a major social media company that hosts applications including WeChat (\u22481.13 billion active users in 2019) and QQ (\u2248808 million active users in 2019) (Statista, https://www.statista.comExternal Link); consequently, our model might be demographically biased by the Tencent user base. Further, considerable uncertainty regarding the lag between infection and case detection remains. Our assumption of a 10-day lag is based on early estimates for the incubation period of COVID-19 (4) and prior estimates of the lag between symptom onset and detection for SARS (9). We expect that estimates for the doubling time and incidence of COVID-19 will improve as reconstructed linelists and more granular epidemiologic data become available (Appendix). However, our key qualitative insights likely are robust to these uncertainties, including extensive prequarantine exportations throughout China and far greater case counts in Wuhan than those reported before the quarantine.\n\nDr. Du is a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of Texas at Austin.

Asymptomatic transmission or symptomatic only?\n  These are the defining questions surrounding the person-to-person transmission of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 that have yet to be answered\u2014or answered sufficiently\u2014for US experts monitoring the disease. And the answers hold the key to infection control policies that will become necessary as the disease continues to infect tens of thousands in China and hundreds more across the globe.\n  Yesterday the media reported that a Japanese doctor who was monitoring cruise ship passengers quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess in the port of Yokohama contracted the virus despite wearing gloves and a surgical mask. He joins the more than 500 healthcare workers in Wuhan, China, who have also reportedly contracted the disease\u2014just by the middle of January.\n  These infections put into question how effective infection control policies are at preventing transmission.\nMasks vs respirators\u2014key differences  In its newly published infection prevention and control recommendations for COVID-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of N95 respirators in a healthcare setting with the suspected novel coronavirus, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended surgical masks for general patient care and respirators for aerosol-generating procedures only.\n  Face masks have become ubiquitous in China, sold on the street, and worn by almost everyone in public. A new survey, the Premise Coronavirus Awareness Survey, showed that in Taiwan 79.9% of people questioned said they were wearing masks in an effort to protect themselves from COVID-19. A similar percentage was noted in the Philippines.\n  Bruce Ribner, MD, medical director of the Serious Communicable Diseases Unit at Emory University Hospital, said the two masks serve very different functions. A surgical mask, or procedural mask, is meant to protect the environment from the wearer.\n  \"It's meant to keep the surgeon's respiratory issues away from a patient,\" Ribner explained. A surgical mask does a good job of trapping large droplets, and some aerosol transmission, he said. Many of the masks being worn in China, though, are not designed for medical use or to any standards and so their effectiveness in trapping droplets is unknown.\n  A respirator, such as an N95, fits tighter to the face and is meant to help protect the wearer from inhaling infectious droplets in the environment.\n  \"We don't really know how the coronavirus is being transmitted from person to person, because no one has done the NIOSH studies that simulate the cough big droplets that land 3 to 6 feet away from a person or the little droplets that can travel long distances and in air handling system,\" Ribner said. \"So we have to use what we know about other coronaviruses and influenza when it comes to this disease.\"\n  What we know, Ribner said, is that multiple modes of transmission are likely at play, including large droplets, small droplets (or aerosols), and contaminated hands.\n  At Emory, Ribner is responsible for the care of patients treated for Ebola, Lassa fever, and other serious pathogen diseases.\n  Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, which publishes CIDRAP News, says, \"The very unsettling data regarding the number of infected healthcare workers in the Wuhan area and the infection of a Japanese doctor working with those quarantined on the cruise ship and who used standard PPE [personal protective equipment]\u2014except for a surgical mask instead of an N95 respirator\u2014should be a real wake-up call to all of us about how do we really protect against this critical occupational risk.\"\nHow the virus travels in the air  Donald Milton, MD, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland, helped prove via the use of his Gesundheit machine that influenza could be spread via aerosol transmission. He said he is in contact with colleagues in Singapore who are attempting to study the transmission of the COVID-19 viruses, which are often called nCoV but are officially named SARS-CoV-2.\n  Though Chinese officials said earlier this week that they believe the coronavirus is transmitted only via droplets, implying they do not believe airborne or contact transmission plays a role, Milton said that statement is likely rooted in fear, not science.\n  \"To me this sounds like someone trying to deal with panic, because people panic when they hear airborne transmission and long-distance transmission,\" he said. He said there has been scientific evidence or aerosol transmission of MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), so it is likely possible for this novel coronavirus, as well.\n  Milton cautions that the difference between aerosol and droplet transmission is largely in name only. Respiratory droplets, emitted with a sneeze or a cough, are commonly thought to land within 6 feet of patients and are too large to be buoyant on air currents. Respiratory aerosols are droplets too, Milton said, but smaller and light enough to travel farther.\n  \"You cannot tell the difference epidemiologically between something aerosol transmitted by weak sources and large droplet spray,\" said Milton. \"They behave so similar, it's very hard to pick up the difference.\"\n  He said he suspects the capability of long-distance transmission with COVID-19 will be connected to source strength, or how symptomatic a person is.\nProtection may depend on resources  For Ribner, the issue of correct mask use will linger until the exact route of transmission is documented, and it is established if an asymptomatic person (one having no symptoms) can shed the virus before becoming sick.\n  \"If we have a person who is shedding nCoV in the environment, the best way to stop transmission is to stick a surgical procedure mask on them,\" Ribner said. \"In the best of all worlds, anyone coming into the room with an nCoV patient would wear a respirator.\"\n  But if a respirator is not available, because of cost or manufacturing, the next best option is a surgical mask, Ribner said. He said that likely contributes to the WHO's surgical mask recommendation.\n  \"The WHO is sensitive to the fact that not every part of the world has the resources of the US and Western Europe,\" he said.\nKeeping health workers from becoming patients  But Osterholm counters, \"Frankly, the WHO recommendation that surgical masks provide adequate protection for healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients is not consistent with data we have from similar transmission dynamics we see with influenza virus.\"\n  In an op-ed today in the Washington Post, Osterholm and coauthor Mark Olshaker stressed, \"In a very real sense, what happens to our health-care workers will be the metric of how we respond to this unfolding crisis. If we don't do all we can to protect them, they will quickly transition from providers to patients, further stressing already overburdened facilities.\"\n  They add, \"Governments must support private-sector manufacturers in providing N95s and other equipment to front-line health-care providers and other essential workers. In terms of minimizing illness and death, this will be more important than any border closing, airport screening, or quarantine.\"\nSee also:\n  Feb 12 New York Times Japanese cruise ship story\n  Feb 11 Premise Data news release on COVID-19 survey\n  Feb 12 CDC guidance on respirator use\n  Feb 13 Washington Post op-ed",

The initial cases were linked to exposures in a seafood market in Wuhan.1 As of January 27, 2020, the Chinese authorities reported 2835 confirmed cases in mainland China, including 81 deaths. Additionally, 19 confirmed cases were identified in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and 39 imported cases were identified in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, United States, Vietnam, Singapore, Nepal, France, Australia and Canada. The pathogen was soon identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is closely related to sever acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV).2 Currently, there is no specific treatment against the new virus. Therefore, identifying effective antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed.\n  An efficient approach to drug discovery is to test whether the existing antiviral drugs are effective in treating related viral infections. The 2019-nCoV belongs to Betacoronavirus which also contains SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). Several drugs, such as ribavirin, interferon, lopinavir-ritonavir, corticosteroids, have been used in patients with SARS or MERS, although the efficacy of some drugs remains controversial.3 In this study, we evaluated the antiviral efficiency of five FAD-approved drugs including ribavirin, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, nafamostat, chloroquine and two well-known broad-spectrum antiviral drugs remdesivir (GS-5734) and favipiravir (T-705) against a clinical isolate of 2019-nCoV in vitro.\n  Standard assays were carried out to measure the effects of these compounds on the cytotoxicity, virus yield and infection rates of 2019-nCoVs. Firstly, the cytotoxicity of the candidate compounds in Vero E6 cells (ATCC-1586) was determined by the CCK8 assay. Then, Vero E6 cells were infected with nCoV-2019BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/20192 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05 in the presence of varying concentrations of the test drugs. DMSO was used in the controls. Efficacies were evaluated by quantification of viral copy numbers in the cell supernatant via quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and confirmed with visualization of virus nucleoprotein (NP) expression through immunofluorescence microscopy at 48\u2009h post infection (p.i.) (cytopathic effect was not obvious at this time point of infection). Among the seven tested drugs, high concentrations of three nucleoside analogs including ribavirin (half-maximal effective concentration (EC50)\u2009=\u2009109.50\u2009\u03bcM, half-cytotoxic concentration (CC50)\u2009>\u2009400\u2009\u03bcM, selectivity index (SI)\u2009>\u20093.65), penciclovir (EC50\u2009=\u200995.96\u2009\u03bcM, CC50\u2009>\u2009400\u2009\u03bcM, SI\u2009>\u20094.17) and favipiravir (EC50\u2009=\u200961.88\u2009\u03bcM, CC50\u2009>\u2009400\u2009\u03bcM, SI\u2009>\u20096.46) were required to reduce the viral infection (Fig. 1a and Supplementary information, Fig. S1). However, favipiravir has been shown to be 100% effective in protecting mice against Ebola virus challenge, although its EC50 value in Vero E6 cells was as high as 67\u2009\u03bcM,4 suggesting further in vivo studies are recommended to evaluate this antiviral nucleoside. Nafamostat, a potent inhibitor of MERS-CoV, which prevents membrane fusion, was inhibitive against the 2019-nCoV infection (EC50\u2009=\u200922.50\u2009\u03bcM, CC50\u2009>\u2009100\u2009\u03bcM, SI\u2009>\u20094.44). Nitazoxanide, a commercial antiprotozoal agent with an antiviral potential against a broad range of viruses including human and animal coronaviruses, inhibited the 2019-nCoV at a low-micromolar concentration (EC50\u2009=\u20092.12\u2009\u03bcM; CC50\u2009>\u200935.53\u2009\u03bcM; SI\u2009>\u200916.76). Further in vivo evaluation of this drug against 2019-nCoV infection is recommended. Notably, two compounds remdesivir (EC50\u2009=\u20090.77\u2009\u03bcM; CC50\u2009>\u2009100\u2009\u03bcM; SI\u2009>\u2009129.87) and chloroquine (EC50\u2009=\u20091.13\u2009\u03bcM; CC50\u2009>\u2009100\u2009\u03bcM, SI\u2009>\u200988.50) potently blocked virus infection at low-micromolar concentration and showed high SI (Fig. 1a, b).\nFig. 1: The antiviral activities of the test drugs against 2019-nCoV in vitro. \n\na Vero E6 cells were infected with 2019-nCoV at an MOI of 0.05 in the treatment of different doses of the indicated antivirals for 48\u2009h. The viral yield in the cell supernatant was then quantified by qRT-PCR. Cytotoxicity of these drugs to Vero E6 cells was measured by CCK-8 assays. The left and right Y-axis of the graphs represent mean % inhibition of virus yield and cytotoxicity of the drugs, respectively. The experiments were done in triplicates. b Immunofluorescence microscopy of virus infection upon treatment of remdesivir and chloroquine. Virus infection and drug treatment were performed as mentioned above. At 48\u2009h p.i., the infected cells were fixed, and then probed with rabbit sera against the NP of a bat SARS-related CoV2 as the primary antibody and Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Abcam) as the secondary antibody, respectively. The nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye. Bars, 100\u2009\u03bcm. c and d Time-of-addition experiment of remdesivir and chloroquine. For \u201cFull-time\u201d treatment, Vero E6 cells were pre-treated with the drugs for 1\u2009h, and virus was then added to allow attachment for 2\u2009h. Afterwards, the virus\u2013drug mixture was removed, and the cells were cultured with drug-containing medium until the end of the experiment. For \u201cEntry\u201d treatment, the drugs were added to the cells for 1\u2009h before viral attachment, and at 2\u2009h p.i., the virus\u2013drug mixture was replaced with fresh culture medium and maintained till the end of the experiment. For \u201cPost-entry\u201d experiment, drugs were added at 2\u2009h p.i., and maintained until the end of the experiment. For all the experimental groups, cells were infected with 2019-nCoV at an MOI of 0.05, and virus yield in the infected cell supernatants was quantified by qRT-PCR c and NP expression in infected cells was analyzed by Western blot d at 14\u2009h p.i.\n\n\nFull size image\n\n  Remdesivir has been recently recognized as a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of RNA viruses (including SARS/MERS-CoV5) infection in cultured cells, mice and nonhuman primate (NHP) models. It is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus infection.6 Remdesivir is an adenosine analogue, which incorporates into nascent viral RNA chains and results in pre-mature termination.7 Our time-of-addition assay showed remdesivir functioned at a stage post virus entry (Fig. 1c, d), which is in agreement with its putative anti-viral mechanism as a nucleotide analogue. Warren et al. showed that in NHP model, intravenous administration of 10\u2009mg/kg dose of remdesivir resulted in concomitant persistent levels of its active form in the blood (10\u2009\u03bcM) and conferred 100% protection against Ebola virus infection.7 Our data showed that EC90 value of remdesivir against 2019-nCoV in Vero E6 cells was 1.76\u2009\u03bcM, suggesting its working concentration is likely to be achieved in NHP. Our preliminary data (Supplementary information, Fig. S2) showed that remdesivir also inhibited virus infection efficiently in a human cell line (human liver cancer Huh-7 cells), which is sensitive to 2019-nCoV.2\n  Chloroquine, a widely-used anti-malarial and autoimmune disease drug, has recently been reported as a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug.8,9 Chloroquine is known to block virus infection by increasing endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion, as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV.10 Our time-of-addition assay demonstrated that chloroquine functioned at both entry, and at post-entry stages of the 2019-nCoV infection in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1c, d). Besides its antiviral activity, chloroquine has an immune-modulating activity, which may synergistically enhance its antiviral effect in vivo. Chloroquine is widely distributed in the whole body, including lung, after oral administration. The EC90 value of chloroquine against the 2019-nCoV in Vero E6 cells was 6.90\u2009\u03bcM, which can be clinically achievable as demonstrated in the plasma of rheumatoid arthritis patients who received 500\u2009mg administration.11 Chloroquine is a cheap and a safe drug that has been used for more than 70 years and, therefore, it is potentially clinically applicable against the 2019-nCoV.\n  Our findings reveal that remdesivir and chloroquine are highly effective in the control of 2019-nCoV infection in vitro. Since these compounds have been used in human patients with a safety track record and shown to be effective against various ailments, we suggest that they should be assessed in human patients suffering from the novel coronavirus disease.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s414...3ggOQQRryV5f60",

Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\nMethods  Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\nFindings  All nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (<1\u00b70\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2079 cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8\u20139 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9\u201310. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\nInterpretation  The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\nFunding  Hubei Science and Technology Plan, Wuhan University Medical Development Plan.\n\nfull article\n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/l...360-3/fulltext",

            "flu_trackers_post_content": "Problematic Lab Testing For The Novel Coronavirus\n\n\n\n#14,858\n\nFor several weeks there have been murmurs - first in Chinese social media - and more recently from more official sources, that the lab tests being used to detect the novel coronavirus in China - and elsewhere - aren't as sensitive as we'd hope.\nPatients - even those with overt symptoms - sometimes test negative, even though they are actually infected. \nThis isn't a new problem, and we've seen it in the past with avian flu (H5N1 in particular), and with MERS-CoV. Nearly two weeks ago, on February 1st, I wrote:\nWhile the rapid development of an RT-PCR test for the novel coronavirus has provided doctors and public health officials an important tool in the fight against this epidemic, no lab test is 100% perfect, and there are unanswered questions over the current test's sensitivity and specificity.Sensitivity is defined as the ability of a test to correctly identify individuals who have a given disease or condition.\nSpecificity is defined as the ability of a test to exclude someone from having a disease or illness.\nIt isn't known exactly when an infected person - who may be exhibiting no, or few symptoms - will likely begin to test positive. How the patient's samples are taken, and transported to the lab, can affect impact reliability. And viral shedding - at least with MERS-CoV - has been shown to be intermittent, which may sometimes foil lab testing. \nYesterday, the CDC announced they had uncovered some problems with the test kits they have recently sent out to all 50 states and to 30 countries; the test failed to consistently identify positive samples. This from quote from a statement by Dr. Nancy Messonnier yesterday.\nAs you know, this is a dynamic, rapidly evolving situation, and our response continues to be based on the latest science. We continue to be flexible to meet the public health challenges that the virus presents, and clearly a success is the CDC rapid development of a diagnostic and rapid deployments to the states, which was clearly important to try to bring the testing closer to patients to avoid delays that have been inherent in sending samples to CDC. When the state receives these test kits, their procedure is to do quality control themselves in their own laboratories.\nAgain, that is part of the normal procedures, but in doing it, some of the states identified some inconclusive laboratory results. We are working closely with them to correct the issues and as we\u2019ve said all along, speed is important, but equally or more important in this situation is making sure that the laboratory results are correct. During a response like this, we know things may not always go as smoothly as we would like. We have multiple levels of quality control to detect issues just like this one. We\u2019re looking into all of these issues to understand what went wrong, and to prevent these same things from happening in the future. \nWith any new test, hiccups are to be expected, particularly given how little we know about this novel coronavirus, and how quickly the test was developed.\n\nBut in October of 2017, a full 5 years after MERS-CoV was first identified, we look at study in AJIC: Intermittent Positive Testing For MERS-CoV, that found intermittent positive results for MERS-CoV on reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests were still a problem. The authors (including Memish and Al-Tawfiq) wrote:\nOur data indicate that 2 to 3 nasopharyngeal samples are needed to produce the highest yield of positive results for MERS-CoV. In addition, 2 negative results 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization are needed to clear patients from MERS-CoV. Evaluation of the yield of sputum samples is needed to assess the effectiveness against nasopharyngeal swabs. \nAccordingly, the CDC's interim recommendations for specimen collection for MERS are more rigorous, calling for `Collection of all three specimen types (not just one or two of the three), lower respiratory, upper respiratory and serum specimens for testing using the CDC MERS rRT-PCR assay is recommended.'\nIn recent day there have been reports out of China that their test kits may only pick up 30% to 50% of infected cases, and last night's inclusion of nearly 15,000 clinically diagnosed cases(without a positive lab test) would seem to bolster those claims. \nTwo days ago, in Japan MOH: 2 Wuhan Evacuees Test Positive For Coronavirus 10 Days After Return, we saw a report on two cases who initially tested negative - one tested negative twice (once even after a fever and cough appeared) - who developed COVID-19 more than 10 days after returning from Wuhan.\n\nTo all of this we can add a study - published yesterday - in Radiology, that found multiple patients with positive chest CTs and other symptoms who continued to test negative for the novel coronavirus.\nRadiology. 2020 Feb 12:200343. doi: 10.1148/radiol.2020200343. [Epub ahead of print]Chest CT for Typical 2019-nCoV Pneumonia: Relationship to Negative RT-PCR Testing.Xie X1, Zhong Z1, Zhao W1, Zheng C1, Wang F1, Liu J1.\nAbstract\n\nSome patients with positive chest CT findings may present with negative results of real time reverse-transcription-polymerase chain- reaction (RT-PCR) for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). \nIn this report, we present chest CT findings from five patients with 2019-nCoV infection who had initial negative RT-PCR results. All five patients had typical imaging findings, including ground-glass opacity (GGO) (5 patients) and/or mixed GGO and mixed consolidation (2 patients).\nAfter isolation for presumed 2019-nCoV pneumonia, all patients were eventually confirmed with 2019-nCoV infection by repeated swab tests. A combination of repeated swab tests and CT scanning may be helpful when for individuals with high clinical suspicion of nCoV infection but negative RT-PCR screening. \nGiven the challenges we've seen in the past with obtaining accurate lab tests on deep lung infections from avian flu and MERS-CoV, the limitations and problems with our current lab tests are not surprising.\nWhile I expect testing will improve in the days and weeks ahead, there will likely never be a 100% reliable test for this novel coronavirus \nBetween sub-optimal sample collection, intermittent viral shedding by the host, sample degradation during transport, and the limitations of the test itself, some false negatives are inevitable. While expected, this does make this novel coronavirus harder to contain. \nNo matter how diligently countries test, some infected cases will get through the screening process. \nWhich means that when we hear that Country X has only 5 cases, or that Country Z has none, we need to take that information with a sizable grain of salt.\n\n\nhttps://afludiary.blogspot.com/2020/...for-novel.html",

Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity. We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6. We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1....07.20021154v1",

Research funders were also on hand to discuss how to mobilize resources so that crucial studies can start immediately.\n  At a media telebriefing today, WHO officials said Chinese researchers participated remotely, and they helped ground the discussions based on the realities on the ground in the outbreak region.\n  Soumya Swaminathan, MD, the WHO's chief scientist, said the top priority was a simpler diagnostic test, which will also be useful for lower-income countries that don't have complex lab facilities. She said another very high priority is information on optimal treatment and the best treatment protocols, which need studies based on standard data collection.\n  She said more research on transmission and epidemiology is also crucial. \"We really need to understand this virus\u2014its transmission, age-groups, underlying conditions, what makes it more severe, impacts of interventions,\" she said. \"We have a lot to learn from studying all of these.\"\n  WHO officials said today there are four vaccines in development, with one or two of them poised to enter human trials in 3 or 4 months, and, if successful, a vaccine might be available for wider use in 12 to 18 months. They said researchers are still working on a master protocol to study existing therapies, used singly or in combination.\nCases continue steady rise in China  China yesterday reported 2,015 new cases, down from 2,479 reported the day before, raising the overall total to 44,653, according to the latest update from the country's National Health Commission (NHC). Also, officials reported 871 new serious cases and 97 more deaths, putting those totals at 8,204, and 1,113, respectively. So far 4,740 have been discharged from the hospital.\n  At today's media briefing, Ryan said deaths are on the rise, because there's a lag time between the time when cases surge, such as they did in the past 2 weeks, and when people with serious disease succumb from the disease.\n  Sylvie Briand, MD, PhD, the WHO's director of epidemic and pandemic diseases, said WHO officials have confirmed that China has adapted its case definition to include asymptomatic and mild cases that weren't included in the initial case definition. She said it's normal to adapt the case definition as outbreaks unfold, and Chinese health officials are now able to test contacts and look for transmission chains.\n  Mike Ryan, MD, who directs the WHO's health emergencies program, said the shift is likely to generate even more confirmed cases, likening the case definition change to throwing a wider net with a finer mesh. \"This is what we want to see in the containment phase.\"\nMore Japan cruise ship cases  In developments outside of China, Japan's health ministry today reported 39 more COVID-19 cruise ship cases, raising the total to 174. Media reports said one of the newly confirmed patients is the Japanese quarantine office assigned to the ship.\n  The Diamond Princess has been in Yokohama port since Feb 3.\n  Meanwhile, another ship that has been denied entry by four countries over fears of the virus, even though no suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported on it, was allowed by Cambodia to dock and for passengers to disembark.\n  At today's WHO media briefing, Tedros said the Westerdam is expected to arrive in Cambodia tomorrow. \"This is an example of international solidarity,\" he said, adding that the WHO will issue a communique to countries about the need to make risk assessments based on evidence.\n  Singapore today reported three more cases today, all of them locally acquired, including two linked to a church, according to a statement from the country's health ministry. Singapore has now reported 50 cases.\n  At today's WHO media briefing, Ryan said that less than one fourth of the cases outside of China involve local spread, and that there are only eight cases for which a plausible exposure source hasn't been found. \"We have a good view of the virus,\" he said. \"There could be others, but this is what we see.\"\n  In its situation report today, the WHO said that, over the last 24 hours it received reports of 46 new cases outside of China, raising the total to 441 cases from 24 countries.\nSaliva, pregnancy findings  In research developments today, investigators from Hong Kong writing in Clinical Infectious Diseases said they detected the COVID-19 virus in saliva samples from 11 of 12 people they sampled.\n  On serial sampling, they saw a declining trend, and they concluded that the findings are useful, because saliva samples could be a noninvasive specimen for testing. They also noted the saliva findings have implications for infection control.\n  Meanwhile, a research team from China in a case series of nine pregnant women hospitalized in Wuhan with lab-confirmed COVID-19 found that of samples collected from six, all were negative for the virus. The researchers published their report today in The Lancet.\n  The nine babies were delivered via caesarean section. The samples that tested negative included amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples.\n  The authors concluded that the findings from the small group suggest no evidence of vertical transmission in women who have COVID-19 pneumonia late in their pregnancies.\nSee also:\n  Feb 12 Tedros media briefing comments\n  Feb 12 WHO R and D meeting press release\n  Feb 12 China NHC update\n  Feb 12 Japanese health ministry statement\n  Feb 12 Singapore health ministry statement\n  Feb 12 WHO daily situation report\n  Feb 12 Clin Infect Dis abstract\n  Feb 12 Lancet study",

Apparently, one of the reagents used in the tests wasn't performing consistently. \"Things may not always go as smoothly as we'd like,\" she said, adding that the reagent will be remanufactured.\n  For now, states will continue to send all of their COVID-19 clinical specimens to the CDC for testing.\nFirst evacuees in California return home  The first group of Wuhan evacuees completed their 14-day quarantine and were released yesterday to return home, posing no threat to the community, Messonnier said.\n  So far, airport screening has processed more than 30,000 travelers from China who have passed through 11 airports.\n  Though all cases identified in the United States have been linked to Wuhan travelers or their close contacts, preparation continue with the assumption that could gain a foothold in the United States, and changes in community transmission in the United States or other countries could drive changes in recommendations.\nCDC ready to help in China  In international developments, Messonnier said the CDC is in contact with Japanese health officials, because there are an unspecified number of sick Americans on the quarantined cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama port.\n  \"It's concerning that there is a high number of cases,\" she said.\n  So far, the CDC hasn't been invited to be part of an international joint mission to China, she said, though it stands ready to participate if asked. Currently, a three-member advance team from the WHO is in Beijing to meet with Chinese health officials and flesh out details of the joint mission.\nTrump tweet about seasonality called premature  On Feb 7 following a conversation with China's president about the outbreak, President Donald Trump tweeted that as the weather becomes warmer the virus will become weaker and die out.\n  When asked about Trump's tweet, Messonnier said most respiratory viruses are indeed seasonal, but COVID-19 is a new disease that health officials have been observing for only 6 weeks, so it's premature to make assumptions on whether it will continue to circulate into the spring and summer.\n  She added that the CDC, in its outbreak planning, isn't counting on a drop in virus activity as the weather warms.\nTesting on 13th US patient  Yesterday, the CDC confirmed an illness in a patient under federal quarantine in San Diego's Marine Corps Air Station Miramar after returning on an evacuation flight from Wuhan. A media report said the patient was sent back to quarantine following a mix-up in testing.\n  At today's media briefing, Messonnier said a few people with symptoms on the flight were immediately transported to the hospital and that a system for matching individuals to lab specimens didn't work correctly. The initial test run didn't include the patient's sample. She said the situation was unfortunate, but there were extra quality control measures in place.\n  Appropriate infection control procedures were in place the whole time, Messonnier said.\nHHS, Janssen to work on vaccine  The US Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS's) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) will expand an existing partnership with New Jersey\u2013based Janssen Research & Development, part of Johnson & Johnson, HHS said yesterday in a news release.\n  Janssen and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of ASPR, will share research and development costs and expertise to help speed Janssen's candidate COVID-19 vaccine into clinical trials.\n  BARDA Director Rick Bright, PhD, said, \"With emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19, speed is crucial to saving lives and reducing further spread of the virus. Janssen is a proven partner with a flexible, rapid, vaccine platform which gives us an edge in the race to protect people in the U.S. and worldwide from the health security threat posed by this novel coronavirus.\"\n  Janssen also will ramp up production and manufacturing capacities to manufacture the candidate vaccine, similar to the approach it used with its Ebola vaccine, which is now being used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nSee also:\n  Feb 7 CNN report on Trump's tweet\n  Feb 11 CIDRAP News story \"Deaths from newly named coronavirus disease top 1,000\"\n  Feb 11 HHS news release",

Efforts must focus on building the country's health system, he added, as part of steps to prevent the next outbreak.\n  Robert Steffen, MD, the emergency committee's chair, said the committee is pleased about significant progress in the two hardest-hit provinces and that only two health districts have recently reported cases. The committee downgraded the risk to the regional and national areas from very high to high. The global risk is low. He said there are still two dark clouds on the horizon with the outbreak: continued aggression by rebel groups and a lack of global financial support for the outbreak response.\n  Today's meeting was the emergency committee's sixth for the DRC's outbreak. WHO emergency committees typically meet every 3 months, or sooner if needed, to reassess developments and tweak their recommendations.\n  According to the WHO's online Ebola dashboard, there is one new Ebola case, raising the total to 3,432. So far, 2,249 people have died from their infections, and health officials are still investigating 537 suspected cases. For the week ending Feb 9, three new cases were reported, all from Beni.\nFeb 12 WHO statement\nWHO online Ebola dashboard\n\nSaudi Arabia reports 6th MERS case this month  Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health (MOH) reported another new MERS-CoV case today, the sixth case this month.\n  The new case involves a 34-year-old man from Dhahran whose exposure to MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) is listed as primary, meaning it is unlikely he contracted the virus from another person. The man's camel contact status is unknown, and he is not a healthcare worker.\n  Saudi Arabia reported 15 cases in January, including a probable healthcare-related cluster of 6 cases in Abha.\n  The WHO said in its latest monthly update that, since 2012, it has received reports of 2,499 MERS-CoV cases, at least 861 of them fatal. The vast majority of these cases were in Saudi Arabia.\nFeb 12 MOH report \n\nEPA registers first Candida auris disinfectants for hospitals  The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today announced the availability of 11 products that can be used to disinfect surfaces against the multidrug-resistant fungus Candida auris, an emerging pathogen that has proven difficult for healthcare facilities to eradicate.\n  Agency officials say they hope that the products registered today, which include sporicidal and germicidal sprays and wipes, will help hospitals and nursing homes reduce the spread of the pathogen, which can cause severe and deadly invasive infections, persists on healthcare surfaces, and spreads easily between patients.\n  \"Disinfecting surfaces is one of the best ways to stop the spread of C. auris infections, and EPA's efforts are helping to ensure that healthcare providers have products that can effectively reduce the spread of the dangerous fungus,\" Alexandra Dapolito Dunn, JD, assistant administrator of the EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, said in an agency press release.\n  The EPA says it's been working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to ensure the products are effective. Prior to these 11 products being registered, there were no antimicrobial pesticides registered specifically for use against C auris. But the CDC says testing has confirmed that some disinfectants with an EPA claim for Clostridioides difficile are also effective against the fungus.\n  Since it was first detected in the United States in July 2016, C auris has spread to hospitals in 16 states. According to the CDC's most recent case count, there were 988 confirmed C auris cases as of Dec 31, 2019, and 30 probable cases. An additional 2,051 patients have been found to be colonized.\n  The CDC says research into disinfection methods that are effective against C auris is ongoing.\nFeb 12 EPA press release\nFeb 12 CDC case count page\n\nNew initiative aims to reduce antibiotic residue in pharma manufacturing  The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) launched a new initiative this week that aims to reduce emissions of antibiotic residue from pharmaceutical manufacturing.\n  The Responsible Antibiotics Manufacturing Platform (RAMP) will bring together governments, civil society, and the pharmaceutical industry to improve responsible manufacturing and the supply of antibiotics.\n  \"Reducing emissions of antibiotics from manufacturing is a shared responsibility,\" Nicolai Schaaf, program manager of SIWI\u2019s Pharma Team, said in a SIWI press release. \"This requires changes both in industry practices and when it comes to market demand and regulation. Acknowledging this as a shared objective in the fight against antimicrobial resistance is the starting point for our collaboration platform.\"\n  The platform was launched in New Delhi, India. India is one of the world's largest manufacturers of antibiotics, and studies of wastewater from Indian pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities have found high concentrations of antibiotic residues. Experts believe that when this water is released into the environment, the antibiotic residues can promote the development and spread of antibiotic resistance.\n  The launch comes on the heels of legislation introduced by the Indian Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change that would make India the first country to limit the concentration of antibiotics in wastewater discharged by the pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities.\nFeb 10 SIWI press release",

The counties are in the western, northeastern, and southern regions of the state. \"Early detection is key,\" Harms added. \"We want to increase the surveillance in close proximity to the positive deer to hopefully catch any other positives in the area.\"\n  The 43 new cases more than doubles the previous high of 18 confirmed in 2018-19, according to Radio Iowa. Iowa officials have now logged 89 CWD-positive deer since the disease was first found in the state in 2013-14. The Iowa DNR tested almost 7,000 deer tissue samples statewide during the 2019-20 hunting season.\n  CWD is a deadly neurologic prion disease that affects cervids\u2014members of the deer family. Though the disease has not yet jumped to humans, some experts fear it could mimic bovine spongiform encephalopathy (\"mad cow\" disease).\nFeb 11 Iowa DNR press release\nFeb 11 Radio Iowa story\n\nWith 3 new affected counties, CWD now found in 12 South Dakota counties  The South Dakota Game, Fish & Parks (GFP) Commission confirmed 3 new CWD-affected counties, bringing the total to 12. Less than a year ago only 1 South Dakota county was affected.\n  The newly affected counties are Butte, Corson, and Haakon in the western half of the state, according to a GFP news release. GFP official confirmed eight newly affected counties in the fall of 2019.\n  \"We've learned that CWD is not a disease just restricted to the Black Hills and surrounding area, and this definitely creates some challenges moving forward,\" said GFP wildlife program administrator Chad Switzer. \"As the surveillance efforts from the 2019 hunting seasons come to [an] end, an update will be provided to the GFP Commission in March and a report will be made available to the public on our website,\" said Switzer.\n  The GFP recently created regulations for the transportation and disposal of deer and elk carcasses from other states and from hunting units within South Dakota's confirmed CWD areas, but the regulations won't go into effect until later this year.\nFeb 10 South Dakota GFP news release\n\nMontana to begin in-state CWD testing this fall  Montana hunters this fall should be able to have samples from their deer and elk tested for CWD within the state, markedly cutting the waiting time for test results, the Associated Press (AP) reported yesterday.\n  The Montana Department of Livestock's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (VDL) in Bozeman bought equipment to perform tests for the disease. Previously, Montana officials sent thousands of lymph node samples to Colorado State University for testing, which normally provides results in 2 to 3 weeks.\n  The testing is expected to be operational by the fall, and VDL Director Greg Juda, PhD, said that the Bozeman lab should be able to report results in days rather than weeks. \"Once you get to the dissected tissue portion, it should be a relatively rapid turnaround,\" Juda said.\nFeb 11 AP story",

Protecting the U.S. from global pandemics Statement before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs February 12, 2020\n\n\n\nThe epidemic spread of coronavirus in China \u2014 along with community transmission in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan \u2014 sharply increase the chance that we endure pandemic spread. Worse still, the novel coronavirus may become endemic. It could take a new position as a more sinister member of the seasonal pathogens that circulate each year and infect humans.\n\nThe next month is critical. We must prepare for the prospect that the virus evaded our border protections and was already introduced into the U.S. in late December or early January \u2014 when it first appears to have become epidemic in China\u2019s Hubei province. Those index cases could have seeded community spread, and eventually, outbreaks could emerge in America. We have the capacity to contain small outbreaks. But we need to be vigilant and ready.\n\nModels suggest that from the time of first introduction of the virus into China \u2014 which we now suspect occurred sometime in November \u2014 to the time of epidemic spread in China, was about 10 weeks.[i] The experience in the U.S. is likely to be different, not least because our awareness of this risk is prompting collective action that can limit spread. But China\u2019s experience shows that if cases were imported into the U.S. in early January and remain undetected, then we could still be early in our own evolution toward broader outbreaks. Right now, we\u2019re depending largely on clinical surveillance as our primary tool for identifying potential outbreaks since we\u2019re just now deploying diagnostic tools to the Laboratory Response Network. Moreover, we still haven\u2019t broadened our screening criteria to include patients who don\u2019t have a connection to recent travel to China. This limits our ability to identify secondary spread. So, we may know we\u2019re experiencing outbreaks of this disease only when a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia present to a hospital and trigger closer scrutiny by health officials. By that time, there could be dozens or even hundreds of cases in a local community. Controlling broader spread could become a challenge.\n\nRead the full testimony here.",

We need to come together to fight a common enemy that does not respect borders, ensure that we have the resources necessary to bring this outbreak to an end and bring our best science to the forefront to find shared answers to shared problems. Research is an integral part of the outbreak response,\u201d said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cI appreciate the positive response of the research community to join us at short notice and come up with concrete plans and commitment to work together.\u201d\n\nThe meeting, hosted in collaboration with GloPID-R (the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness) brought together major research funders and over 300 scientists and researchers from a large variety of disciplines. They discussed all aspects of the outbreak and ways to control it including:the natural history of the virus, its transmission and diagnosis;\nanimal and environmental research on the origin of the virus, including management measures at the human-animal interface;\nepidemiological studies;\nclinical characterization and management of disease caused by the virus;\ninfection prevention and control, including best ways to protect health care workers;\nresearch and development for candidate therapeutics and vaccines;\nethical considerations for research;\nand integration of social sciences into the outbreak response.\n\n\u201cThis meeting allowed us to identify the urgent priorities for research. As a group of funders we will continue to mobilize, coordinate and align our funding to enable the research needed to tackle this crisis and stop the outbreak, in partnership with WHO,\u201d said Professor Yazdan Yazdanpanah, chair of GloPID-R. \u201cEquitable access \u2013 making sure we share data and reach those most in need,  in particular those in lower and middle-income countries, is fundamental to this work which must be guided by ethical considerations at all times.\u201d  \n\nDuring the meeting, the more than 300 scientists and researchers participating both in person and virtually agreed on a set of global research priorities. They also outlined mechanisms for continuing scientific interactions and collaborations beyond the meeting which will be coordinated and facilitated by WHO. They worked with research funders to determine how necessary resources can be mobilized so that critical research can start immediately.\n\nThe deliberations will form the basis of a research and innovation roadmap charting all the research needed and this will be used by researchers and funders to accelerate the research response.

Of the 48 new cases confirmed outside China yesterday, 40 were on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is currently quarantined in Yokohama.\n\nWe are in constant contact with the Japanese government, the International Maritime Organization, and the owner of the ship to protect the health of all passengers.\n\nNow we have three cruise ships that have experienced delayed port clearance or have been denied entry to ports, often without an evidence-based risk assessment.\n\nTogether with the International Maritime Organization, we will issue a communique to all countries to respect the principle of \u201cfree pratique\u201d for ships and the principle of proper care for all travelers, in accordance with the International Health Regulations.\n\nWe have also established lines of communication with IMO, the Cruise Lines International Association and the major cruise operators to ensure we have accurate information and can provide the right advice.\n\nWHO has published guidance on how to handle public health events like this on ships, and we urge countries and companies to follow that guidance.\n\nI\u2019m also pleased to announce that today Cambodia agreed to accept the Westerdam cruise ship, which has been stranded at sea for several days.\n\nBased on what we have been told, there are no suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 on board the Westerdam.\n\nThe ship will arrive in Cambodia tomorrow morning.\n\nThis afternoon I spoke to Cambodia\u2019s Minister of Health to thank him for allowing the Westerdam to dock in his country, and I would like to use this opportunity to appreciate the government, especially His Excellency the Prime Minister.\n\nThis is an example of the international solidarity we have consistently been calling for.\n\nOutbreaks can bring out the best and worst in people.\n\nStigmatizing individuals or entire nations does nothing but harm the response.\n\nInstead of directing all our energy against the outbreak, stigma diverts our attention and turns people against each other.\n\nI will say it again: this is a time for solidarity, not stigma.\n\n===\n\nAs you know, the research and innovation forum on COVID-19 concluded this afternoon.\n\nI was very encouraged to see the energy and speed with which the global research community has taken up this challenge.\n\nAs we speak, research groups are meeting with the leading research funders to start work immediately on the most pressing questions.\n\nSome of these issues include easy to apply diagnostics, the best approaches for infection prevention, potential therapies that could be used to treat patients, existing vaccine candidates and how to accelerate them, and how to address the infodemic.\n\nWe\u2019re also doing deeper investigations to identify the source of this virus and to prevent further transmission from animals to humans.\n\nWHO is now developing a master plan for coordinating clinical trials and ensuring they are done coherently and consistently.\n\nMeanwhile, we continue to support countries with the tools and equipment they need now to diagnose cases and protect health workers.\n\nWe have shipped diagnostic kits to laboratories around the world, and we will continue to do so.\n\nAnd we\u2019re also sending supplies of masks, gloves, gowns and other personal protective equipment to protect frontline health workers in 18 countries that need our support, and we have more in the pipeline.\n\nFinally, our advance team in China has made good progress in working out the composition of the team and the scope of its work. We hope to have more news to announce soon.\n\nI thank you.\nhttps://www.who.int/dg/speeches/deta...d-19-outbreaks",

Read the entire Travel Advisory.\n\nA novel (new) coronavirus is causing an outbreak of respiratory illness that began in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization determined the rapidly spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\n\nThe Hong Kong government has reported cases of the novel coronavirus in its special administrative region, has upgraded its response level to emergency, its highest response level, and is taking other steps to manage the novel Coronavirus outbreak. On February 8, the Hong Kong government began enforcing a compulsory 14-day quarantine for anyone, regardless of nationality, arriving in Hong Kong who has visited mainland China within a 14-day period. This quarantine does not apply to individuals transiting Hong Kong International Airport and certain exempted groups such as flight crews. However, health screening measures are in place at all of Hong Kong\u2019s borders and the Hong Kong authorities will quarantine individual travelers, including passengers transiting the Hong Kong International Airport, if the Hong Kong authorities determine the traveler to be a health risk. Please refer to the Hong Kong government\u2019s press release for further details.\n\nOn January 30, the Hong Kong government temporarily closed certain transportation links and border checkpoints connecting Hong Kong with mainland China and on February 3 suspended ferry services from Macau.\n\nOn February 10, 2020 the Department of State allowed for the voluntary departure of non-emergency U.S. government employees and their family members due to the novel coronavirus and the impact to Mission personnel as schools and some public facilities have been closed until further notice.\n\nThe Department of State has raised the Travel Advisory for mainland China to Level 4: Do Not Travel due to the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 3 Warning: Avoid all nonessential travel to China.\n\nIf you travel to Hong Kong, you should:Avoid contact with sick people.\nDiscuss travel to Hong Kong with your healthcare provider. Older adults and travelers with underlying health issues may be at risk for more severe disease.\nAvoid animals (alive or dead), animal markets, and products that come from animals (such as uncooked meat).\nCover your mouth and nose with tissue paper when coughing or sneezing.\nWash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.\nMaintain drainage pipes properly and add water to U-traps regularly.\nPut the toilet lid down before you flush to prevent the spread of germs.\n\nIf you traveled to Hong Kong in the last 14 days and feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, you should:Seek medical care right away. Before you go to a doctor\u2019s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.\nAvoid contact with others.\nDo not travel while sick.\nCover your mouth and nose with tissue paper when coughing or sneezing.\nWash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.\nWear a mask and seek medical advice promptly if unwell.\n\nPlease monitor the Hong Kong government\u2019s website for further updates on the coronavirus infection.\n\nSee https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/novel-coronavirus-china and https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/novel-coronavirus-2019.html for additional guidance.\n\nContinue to exercise increased caution in Hong Kong due to civil unrest.\n\nCountry Summary: Since June 2019, large scale and smaller political demonstrations have taken place in various areas of Hong Kong, including MTR stations, shopping malls, universities, and at Hong Kong International airport. While many demonstrations have been peaceful, some have resulted in violent confrontations between protesters and police \u2013 or between protesters and people who oppose the demonstrations \u2013 leading to serious injuries. Police have used a variety of crowd control measures, including tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, and water cannons. Some protesters have lit fires, built barricades, and thrown Molotov cocktails (petrol bombs). Police have identified and seized weapons and explosive materials linked to ongoing protest activity. Any protests that take place without a permit are considered illegal.\n\nProtests, which can take place with little or no notice at any time of the week, are likely to continue and are often accompanied by vandalism and/or violence.\n\nU.S. citizens, as well as U.S. Consulate General employees, have been subject to a People\u2019s Republic of China propaganda campaign falsely accusing the United States of fomenting unrest in Hong Kong.\n\nRead the Safety and Security section on the country information page.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Hong Kong:Monitor local media, local transportations sites and apps like MTR Mobile or CitybusNWFB, and the Hong Kong International Airport website for updates.\nAvoid the areas of the demonstrations.\nExercise caution if you are in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests.\nAvoid taking photographs of protesters or police without permission.\nBe aware of your surroundings.\nKeep a low profile.\nReview your flight status with your airline or at the Hong Kong International Airport website.\nFollow U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong on Facebook and Twitter.\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\nFollow the Department of State on Facebook and Twitter.\nReview the Crime and Safety Report for Hong Kong.\nU.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergency situations.

Unlike most summer blockbusters, this film endeavored to portray the science as accurately as possible (see my review here).\nOne area where the movie took considerable dramatic license was in portraying the development (and deployment) of a vaccine for this never-before-seen virus as happening over a matter of months, rather than years. \nJust 4 months ago, a naturally occuring novel coronavirus sparking an epidemic was the fictional scenario used by Johns Hopkins Center For Health Security (JHCHS) - in concert with the World Economic Forum and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation - in a half-day table top pandemic exercise (#Event201) hosted in New York City.\nJHCHS Pandemic Table Top Exercise (EVENT 201) Videos Now Available OnlineThe JHCHS #Event201 (Fictional) CAPS Pandemic Scenario Johns Hopkins Pandemic Table Top Exercise (EVENT 201) \nIn the JHCHS scenario, there was no possibility of a vaccine being available in the first year, and while there was a fictional antiviral drug that could help the sick, it wouldn't do much to slow the pandemic.\n\nNow, with life imitating art, we've got a very real novel coronavirus - albeit of uncertain severity - spreading across China and slowly spilling out around the world. A vaccine is considered a long shot in anything less than 12 to 18 months, and right now, we don't have a known pharmacological intervention.\nDespite all of this, we are not defenseless. \nLast November, I wrote a multi-blog series (links below) on the WHO's revised 91-page Guidance document on the use of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions during a severe influenza epidemic or pandemic.\nWHO Guidance: Non-pharmaceutical Public Health Measures for Mitigating the Risk and Impact of Epidemic and Pandemic InfluenzaThe WHO NPI Guidance : Personal ProtectionThe WHO NPI Guidance : Social DistancingThe WHO NPI Guidance : Environmental MeasuresThe WHO Pandemic Influenza NPI Guidance : Travel Measures \nWhile many countries have triggered these NPIs a lot sooner (and far more rigorously) than envisioned in this WHO document, when properly and consistently used, they can greatly reduce the spread and impact of a pandemic virus.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) webpage defines NPIs as:\nNonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are actions, apart from getting vaccinated and taking medicine, that people and communities can take to help slow the spread of illnesses like influenza (flu). NPIs are also known as community mitigation strategies. \nMeasures like social distancing, hand hygiene, staying home when sick, avoiding crowds, wearing a mask if you are sick, even the closure of schools or other public venues are all potential NPIs.\n\nWhile some may scoff at their effectiveness, we have a real-world example during the worst flu pandemic in recorded history - the 1918 Spanish flu.\n\n\n\nThe chart above, taken from the PNAS journal article entitled Public Health Interventions and Pandemic Intensity During the 1918 Influenza Pandemic, illustrates what happened in two American cities during the 1918 pandemic.The sharp, but much shorter pandemic wave depicted by the solid line occurred in Philadelphia, where relatively few steps were taken by the public health department to slow the spread of the disease . They even went ahead with a massive Liberty Loan parade on September 28th of that year, apparently heartened by the low number of flu cases reported in Pennsylvania to that point.\nThe dotted line represents St. Louis, which closed schools early and where the Health Department prohibited public gatherings in places like theaters, churches, and restaurants. As you can see, the percentage of cases reported on a daily basis were far fewer in St. Louis, but their pandemic wave lasted nearly twice as long as in Philadelphia.\nDuring the 3 weeks following Philadelphia's parade at least 6,081 deaths from influenza and 2,651 deaths from pneumonia were registered in Pennsylvania, most occurring in Philadelphia (CDC source).At its worst, the percentage of excess people afflicted in the city of Philadelphia was 5 times greater than what St. Louis experienced.\nThe burden on hospitals, mortuaries, and practically all segments of the economy was certainly far greater. \nIn 2017's  Community Pandemic Mitigation's Primary Goal : Flattening The Curve, we look at the HHS/CDC's 2017 revised Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza, which urges communities to be more like St. Louis in a pandemic.\n\nSpecific goals for implementing NPIs early in a pandemic include slowing acceleration of the number of cases in a community, reducing the peak number of cases during the pandemic and related health care demands on hospitals and infrastructure, and decreasing overall cases and health effects (Figure 1). \n\nNPIs don't come without a cost, both economic and societal, but they can greatly limit the impact of a severe epidemic or pandemic, and save lives.\nBut in order to be successful, they must be rigorously observed. \nIf you haven't done so already, now would be a good time to familiarize yourself with the CDC's plans to deal with a severe epidemic. You'll find some earlier blogs on the revised 2017 guidance at:\nCDC/HHS Community Pandemic Mitigation Plan - 2017\n\nPSAF Is The New Pandemic Severity Index \nAdditionally, the CDC has prepared pandemic guidance for a number of other venues:Get Ready for Pandemic Flu: Educational Settings [PDF \u2013 16 pages]\nGet Ready for Pandemic Flu: Workplace Settings [PDF \u2013 16 pages]\nGet Ready for Pandemic Flu: Event Planners [PDF \u2013 16 pages]\nGet Ready for Pandemic Flu: Community and Faith-Based Organizations Serving Vulnerable Populations [PDF \u2013 16 pages]\nGet Ready for Pandemic Flu: Health Communicators [PDF \u2013 17 pages]\n\nWhile it is too soon to know which of these measures will be needed here for the novel coronavirus, much of what you can do now to prepare for a pandemic will hold you in good stead for any prolonged emergency or disaster.\n\nhttps://afludiary.blogspot.com/2020/...t-line-of.html",

An integrative review of the limited evidence on international travel bans as an emerging infectious disease disaster control measure.Errett NA1, Sauer LM2, Rutkow L3.\nAuthor informationAbstract   In our increasingly interconnected world, the potential for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) to spread globally is of paramount concern. Travel bans-herein defined as the complete restriction of travel from at least one geographic region to at least one other international geographic region-are a potential policy solution to control the global spread of disease. The social, economic, and health-related consequences of travel bans, as well as the available evidence on the effectiveness of travel restrictions in preventing the global spread of influenza, have been previously described. However, the effectiveness of travel bans in reducing the spread of noninfluenza EIDs, characterized by different rates and modes of transmission, is less well understood. This study employs an integrative review approach to summarize the minimal evidence on effectiveness of travel bans to decrease the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola virus disease (EVD), and Zika virus disease (ZVD). We describe and qualify the evidence presented in six modeling studies that assess the effectiveness of travel bans in controlling these noninfluenza EID events. We conclude that there is an urgent need for additional research to inform policy decisions on the use of travel bans and other control measures to control noninfluenza EIDs in advance of the next outbreak.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031668\n PMID: \t32031668 \tDOI: \t10.5055/jem.2020.0446",

The daily numbers, while a useful metric, almost certainly badly underestimate the extent of the outbreak in China.\n\nAnd that could be good news, at least as far as the overall CFR of this disease is concerned. Even if the number of deaths is off by a factor of 10, with the number of estimated cases nearly 20 times higher than stated, that would cut the apparent mortality rate in half.\nThe rub is, there are over 7,000 seriously ill people hospitalized in China, and their outcomes are still unknown. Some percentage of these cases will not survive, making an assessment of the severity of this disease very difficult to determine. \nTaking their best shot at it, with the limited data available, the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis has issued their 4th Report, which estimates that 1 in 5 of the severe cases will likely die, and that COVID-19 likely has a CFR of about 1%. \n\nSome excerpts from yesterday's press release/news story by Imperial College of London.\nCoronavirus fatality rate estimated by Imperial scientistsby Kate Wighton, Dr Sabine L. van Elsland11 February 2020\nImperial researchers have released estimates on the fatality rate of the Covid-19 coronavirus.According to the latest estimates from the team, from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial, one percent of people with the disease will die from their infection.Our estimates suggest the impact of the unfolding epidemic may be comparable to the major influenza pandemics of the twentieth century.\n\nThis is the fourth report from the team, who are also part of J-IDEA, the Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics.\nSince the emergence of the new coronavirus (Covid-19) in December 2019, the team have adopted a policy of immediately sharing research findings on the developing pandemic. The new report presents an assessment of the severity of the likely health impact of Covid-19.\nA key measure of severity of any outbreak is the case fatality ratio (CFR) - the proportion of people with a disease who will eventually die as a result of infection. Quantifying this can be challenging.Cases of infection are detected through surveillance, which typically occurs when ill people seek healthcare. Depending on the demands a healthcare system is under, and the capacity to undertake testing, confirmed case numbers reported during an outbreak only ever represent a fraction of the true levels of infection in the community.\nIn addition, it can take weeks for the final clinical outcome of someone infected with a respiratory virus such as Covid-19 to be known and reported.\nFor the new report, the researchers used statistical models that combined data on deaths and recoveries reported in China and in travellers outside mainland China, as well as infections in repatriated citizens.\nDr Ilaria Dorigatti, co-author of the report, said: \u201cThe estimates published in today\u2019s report rely on limited data and the next few weeks will provide valuable information on the outcome of current infections, which will allow us to refine our estimates and fill our knowledge gaps on the severity of this new virus.\u201d\nProfessor Neil Ferguson, co-author of the report, explained: \u201cUnderstanding the likely impact of the unfolding pandemic caused by the Covid-19 virus on human health will be critical to informing the decisions made by countries in the coming weeks in how best to respond to this new public health threat. Our estimates \u2013 while subject to much uncertainty due to the limited data currently available \u2013 suggest that the impact of the unfolding epidemic may be comparable to the major influenza pandemics of the twentieth century. It is therefore vital that countries across the world continue to work together to accelerate the development and testing of effective treatments and vaccines, on the fastest possible timescale. Surveillance and data sharing also need to be further enhanced to allow the spectrum of disease severity caused by this virus to be better understood.\u201d\n\nOne in five fatality rate among severe cases\n\nThe team estimate that people dying now from the virus on average first developed symptoms three weeks ago. This means the numbers of deaths reported today should be compared with the numbers of cases reported over two weeks ago, to gain insight into the true proportion of people who might die from their infection.\n\n(Continue . . . ) \nAssuming these estimates pan out (and that's still a big assumption), a 1% Case Fatality Rate - while half of what was seen during the 1918 pandemic - is still easily 10 to 20 times deadlier than seasonal flu.\n\nWith a global population now nearly 4 times higher than it was at the start of the 1918 pandemic, and an attack rate that could exceed the (20%-30%) attack rate seen during the 1918 pandemic, a 1% CFR would be far from trivial.\nEven at half that rate (.5%), COVID-19 would present a formidable global challenge. \nThese are, of course, imperfect numbers. It may be weeks or even months before we have a reasonable grasp of the CFR and CAR (Case Attack Rate) of this virus - and even then - the impact seen in one part of the world may differ greatly from what is seen in other areas.\nRegions with a decent public health infrastructure are more likely to see fewer cases, and better outcomes, than will low resource countries. \nWhile it seems increasingly likely that COVID-19 will spread globally, how and how quickly that will happen remains unknown.\n\nhttps://afludiary.blogspot.com/2020/...t-numbers.html",

MiRNA Targeted NP Genome of Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccines Provide Cross-Protection against a Lethal Influenza Virus Infection.Gao F1,2, Yang T1, Liu X1, Xiong F1, Luo J1, Yi Y1, Fan J1, Chen Z1, Tan WS2.\nAuthor informationAbstract   The miRNA-based strategy has been used to develop live attenuated influenza vaccines. In this study, the nucleoprotein (NP) genome segment of the influenza virus was inserted by different perfect miRNA-192-5p target sites, and the virus was rescued by standard reverse genetics method, so as to verify the virulence and protective efficacy of live attenuated vaccine in cells and mice. The results showed there was no significant attenuation in 192t virus with one perfect miRNA-192-5p target site, and 192t-3 virus with three perfect miRNA target sites. However, 192t-6 virus with 6 perfect miRNA target sites and 192t-9 virus with 9 perfect miRNA target sites were both significantly attenuated after infection, and their virulence were similar to that of temperature-sensitive (TS) influenza A virus (IAV) which is a temperature-sensitive live attenuated influenza vaccine. Mice were immunized with different doses of 192t-6, 192t-9, and TS IAV. Four weeks after immunization, the IgG in serum and IgA in lung homogenate were increased in the 192t-6, 192t-9, and TS IAV groups, and the numbers of IFN-\u03b3 secreting splenocytes were also increased in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, 192t-6, and 192t-9 can protect the mice against the challenge of homologous PR8 H1N1 virus and heterosubtypic H3N2 influenza virus. MiRNA targeted viruses 192t-6 and 192t-9 were significantly attenuated and showed the same virulence as TS IAV and played a role in the cross-protection.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  NP; cross-protection; influenza virus; live attenuated influenza vaccine; miRNA-192-5p\n\n PMID: \t32028575 \tDOI: \t10.3390/vaccines8010065 \n  Free full text",

Impaired Nuclear Export of the Ribonucleoprotein Complex and Virus-Induced Cytotoxicity Combine to Restrict Propagation of the A/Duck/Malaysia/02/2001 (H9N2) Virus in Human Airway Cells.Kumar S1, Yeo D1,2, Harur Muralidharan N1, Lai SK1, Tong C1, Tan BH2, Sugrue RJ1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   In humans, (A549) cells impaired H9N2 virus nuclear export of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex contrasted with the early and efficient nuclear export of the H1N1/WSN and pH1N1 virus RNP complexes. Although nuclear export of the RNP complex occurred via the nuclear pore complex, H9N2 virus infection also induced modifications in the nuclear envelope and induced cell cytotoxicity. Reduced PA protein levels in H9N2 virus-infected A549 cells occurred, and this phenomenon was independent of virus infection. Silencing the H1N1/WSN PA protein expression leads to impaired nuclear export of RNP complexes, suggesting that the impaired nuclear export of the H9N2 virus RNP complex may be one of the consequences of reduced PA protein levels. Early and efficient export of the RNP complex occurred in H9N2 virus-infected avian (CEF) cells, although structural changes in the nuclear envelope also occurred. Collectively our data suggest that a combination of delayed nuclear export and virus-induced cell cytotoxicity restricts H9N2 virus transmission in A549 cells. However, the early and efficient export of the RNP complex mitigated the effects of virus-induced cytotoxicity on H9N2 virus transmission in CEF cells. Our findings highlight the multi-factorial nature of host-adaptation of the polymerase proteins of avian influenza viruses in non-avian cell environments.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  H9N2 virus; PA protein; avian influenza virus; lamin A/C; nucleoprotein; ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex\n\n PMID: \t32028682 \tDOI: \t10.3390/cells9020355 \n  Free full text",

Maternal influenza infection is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. A case of influenza A (H1N1) during late pregnancy (pregnancy 1, birth 0, pregnancy 30+2 weeks) was admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University on December 16th, 2018. The patient was set on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 1.0, a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O (1 cmH2O = 0.098 kPa), and a tidal volume of 4-6 mL/kg (ideal body weight). However the pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) could only be maintained at about 0.85. The disease was controlled by the treatments of anti-infection, mechanical ventilation, immune therapy, nutritional support, preventive anticoagulant treatment by heparin sodium, adequate negative fluid balance, and other organ support therapy.

Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness among Elementary School Students in Korea during the 2016-2017 Seasons: a Cross-Sectional Survey.Kim YM1, Kang S1, Lim JS1, Kim DH2.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  Annual vaccination is the principal way to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with influenza. In the 2016-2017 influenza seasons, the influenza epidemic appeared to exhibit a different pattern from the previous years. Because of the unusual trend, the incidence of influenza-like patients among school-aged children had increased, causing doubts about the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine among elementary school students in Korea.\nMETHODS:  The study was conducted in elementary schools in each province of Korea in cooperation with the Student Health Policy Division of the Ministry of Education. Each Provincial Office of Education of Korea, except for Jeju, randomly selected one to two elementary schools for each District Office of Education. A total of 2,739 elementary school students were enrolled and vaccination and influenza infection status were collected from the subjects' parents through questionnaires, from February 13th to 21st in 2017. Vaccine effectiveness was defined as calculating the infection rate of influenza among the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups and determining the decreased infection rate of the vaccinated group relative to the unvaccinated group, while adjusting for time of vaccination and infection.\nRESULTS:  Adjusting for the interval between vaccination and infection, vaccine effectiveness of influenza was 17.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.6% to 28.9%), 22.5% (95% CI, 10.3% to 33%), and 28.7% (95% CI, 17.5% to 38.3%) at 2 or more weeks, 3 or more weeks, and 4 or more weeks after vaccination, respectively.\nCONCLUSION:  In conclusion, considering the time required for adequate immunogenicity, the 2016-2017 seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness in Korean elementary school students was 17.6%-28.7%, which was less effective than that of previous years.\n  \u00a9 2020 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Influenza Vaccine; Korean Children; Vaccine Effectiveness\n\n PMID: \t32030923 \tDOI: \t10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e45 \n  Free full text",

[Epub ahead of print]  Molecular pathway of influenza pan-neuraminidase inhibitor resistance in an immunocompromised patient.Abed Y1, Schibler M2, Checkmahomed L1, Carbonneau J1, Venable MC1, Fage C1, Giannotti F3, Goncalves AR2, Kaiser L2, Boivin G1.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  Neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (NAIs), including oseltamivir and zanamivir, play an important therapeutic role against influenza infections in immunocompromised patients. In such settings, however, NAI therapy may lead to the emergence of resistance involving mutations within the influenza surface genes. The aim of this study was to investigate the evolution of NA and hemagglutinin (HA) genes of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in an immunocompromised patient receiving oseltamivir then zanamivir therapies.\nMETHODS:  Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) samples were collected between 01-27-2018 and 04-20-2018 from a hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient. These included 11 samples collected either pre-therapy, during oseltamivir and zanamivir as well as after therapy. The A(H1N1)pdm09 HA/NA genes were sequenced. The H275Y NA substitution was quantified by droplet digital RT-PCR assay. A(H1N1)pdm09 recombinant viruses containing HA mutations were tested by HA elution experiments to investigate in vitro binding properties.\nRESULTS:  Oseltamivir rapidly induced the H275Y NA mutation which constituted 98.33% of the viral population after 15 days of oseltamivir treatment. The related HA gene contained S135A and P183S substitutions within the receptor-binding site. After a switch to zanamivir, 275H/Y and 119E/G/D mixed populations were detected. In the last samples, the double H275Y-E119G NA variant dominated with S135A and P183S HA substitutions.\nCONCLUSIONS:  This report confirms that oseltamivir can rapidly induce the emergence of the H275Y substitution in A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses and subsequent switch to zanamivir can lead to additional substitutions at codon E119 resulting in multi-drug resistance. Such data additionally suggest a potential compensatory role for HA substitutions near the receptor binding site.\n\n\n PMID: \t32031540 \tDOI: \t10.3851/IMP3344",

To increase awareness about its serious complications, we report three cases of influenza A (H1N1) infection complicated with hemolytic uremic syndrome, myocarditis and acute necrotizing encephalopathy. In all three cases, nasopharyngeal samples confirmed influenza A (H1N1) infection by antigen test and multiplex PCR detection. The first case, a 3-year-old girl, had respiratory distress, anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal failure at admission, and was diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome. Supportive treatment and oseltamivir did not prevent the development of chronic renal failure. The second case, a 5-year-old girl admitted with lethargia and flu-like symtoms and was diagnosed with myocarditis and cardiogenic shock. Oseltamivir and supportive treatment including extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) failed. She died on the 3rd day of admission. The third case, a 21-month-old boy, presented with decreased level of consciousness and was diagnosed with acute necrotizing encephalopathy with the aid of cranial magnetic resonance imagining (MRI). He was discharged without any neurological sequelae three weeks after admission. It should be kept in mind that influenza virus does not always cause a self-limited flu.

[Epub ahead of print]  Phylogeographic reconstruction using air transportation data and its application to the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic.Reimering S1, Mu\u00f1oz S1, McHardy AC1,2.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Influenza A viruses cause seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics in the human population. While the worldwide circulation of seasonal influenza is at least partly understood, the exact migration patterns between countries, states or cities are not well studied. Here, we use the Sankoff algorithm for parsimonious phylogeographic reconstruction together with effective distances based on a worldwide air transportation network. By first simulating geographic spread and then phylogenetic trees and genetic sequences, we confirmed that reconstructions with effective distances inferred phylogeographic spread more accurately than reconstructions with geographic distances and Bayesian reconstructions with BEAST that do not use any distance information, and led to comparable results to the Bayesian reconstruction using distance information via a generalized linear model. Our method extends Bayesian methods that estimate rates from the data by using fine-grained locations like airports and inferring intermediate locations not observed among sampled isolates. When applied to sequence data of the pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus in 2009, our approach correctly inferred the origin and proposed airports mainly involved in the spread of the virus. In case of a novel outbreak, this approach allows to rapidly analyze sequence data and infer origin and spread routes to improve disease surveillance and control.\n\n\n PMID: \t32032362 \tDOI: \t10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007101 \n  Free full text",

In total, 322 samples (sera = 161 and throat swab = 161) from butchers and 130 pooled oropharyngeal swabs and 100 sera from birds were collected. Baseline sera (n = 100) from general population were also tested. Data were collected by structured questionnaires. Sera were tested by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test further confirmed by micro-neutralization test (MN). Swabs were processed by real-time RT-PCR. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify risk factors.\nRESULTS:  In butchers, 15.5% sera were positive for antibodies against H9 virus using a cutoff of \u226540 in HI titer; 6% sera from general population were positive for H9. Seroprevalence in poultry was 89%, and only 2.30% swabs were positive for H9. Presence of another LPRS nearby and the number of cages in the stall were risk factors (OR > 1) for H9 seroprevalence in butchers.\nCONCLUSIONS:  This study provides evidence of co-circulation of H9 virus in poultry and exposure of butchers in the LPRSs, which poses a continued threat to public health. We suggest regular surveillance of AIVs in occupationally exposed butchers and birds in LPRSs.\n  \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

[Epub ahead of print]  The role of farm business type on biosecurity practices in West Java broiler farms.Indrawan D1, Cahyadi ER2, Daryanto A3, Hogeveen H4.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Biosecurity is important to prevent introduction and spread of infectious diseases, including Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). HPAI is currently endemic in Indonesia and it has triggered the adoption of a biosecurity policy. Although there is anecdotal evidence about the level of biosecurity on Indonesian broiler farms, formal evidence is lacking, as well as knowledge about determinants of low biosecurity levels. This paper has two main objectives: 1) to assess the levels of biosecurity measures across different farm business types, and (2) to analyze the determining factors, with a special reference to farm business type, for the level of biosecurity and the availability of biosecurity infrastructure in the West Java poultry farms. A multi-stage sampling procedure was applied to collect data from approximately 400 broiler farmers in four districts in West Java province, namely Ciamis, Tasikmalaya, Subang and Sukabumi. Data were collected through farmer interviews and direct observation at the farms. The Biosecurity Control Score (BCS), consisting of 16 practice indicators, and the Farm Infrastructures for Biosecurity (FIB) list consisting of 16 building or physical set-ups as biosecurity facilities were used to assess the level of biosecurity. Determinants of biosecurity measures were analyzed via tobit regression analysis. The results show that the BCS was associated with the total number of birds per cycle, and risk perception (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). The BCS was significantly (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) higher for the farm business types 'independent farming', 'price contract farming' and 'company' compared to the 'makloon contract farming' business type (farming for a fee). Physical set-ups as farm infrastructure for biosecurity (FIB) were associated with the total number of birds per cycle, and with risk perception (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). FIB was significantly (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) higher for the farm business types 'independent farming', 'price contract farming' and 'company' compared to makloon contract farming. The results of this study suggest that business types play a significant role in determining biosecurity practices; a makloon contract farm (farming for a fee) tends to have a lower level of biosecurity than other business types due to lack of incentives. Consequently, in developing incentives for improved biosecurity measures. policymakers should encourage farm registration, and at the same time develop incentives that support the independent and price contract farming.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020.

All passengers were screened upon arrival in Japan for symptoms consistent with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection and tested for presence of the virus. Assuming that the mean detection window of the virus can be informed by the mean serial interval (estimated at 7.5 days), the ascertainment rate of infection was estimated at 9.2% (95% confidence interval: 5.0, 20.0). This indicates that the incidence of infection in Wuhan can be estimated at 20,767 infected individuals, including those with asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infections. The infection fatality risk (IFR)\u2014the actual risk of death among all infected individuals\u2014is therefore 0.3% to 0.6%, which may be comparable to Asian influenza pandemic of 1957\u20131958.\nKeywords:  epidemiology; ascertainment; diagnosis; travel; importation; statistical inference\n\n\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/2/419",

A Meta-Analysis Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Peramivir with Other Neuraminidase Inhibitors for Influenza Treatment.Chen JY1, Wei SK2, Lai CC3, Weng TS2, Wang HH4.\nAuthor informationAbstract   This meta-analysis compared the efficacy and safety of peramivir compared to other neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs). Materials and Methods: Data from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched until January 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (OSs) comparing peramivir with other NAIs for treating influenza were included. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system was used to judge the overall certainty of evidence; the result was moderate. The primary outcome was time to alleviation of symptoms. Twelve articles involving 2681 patients were included in this meta-analysis. We used a random-effect model to pool the effect size, which is expressed as the difference in means (MD), risk ratio (RR), and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Overall, peramivir was superior to other NAIs (MD = -11.214 hours, 95% CI: -19.119 to -3.310). The incidence of adverse events (RR = 1.023, 95% CI: 0.717 to 1.460) and serious adverse events (RR = 1.068, 95% CI: 0.702 to 1.625) in the peramivir group was similar to those in the oseltamivir group. In addition, peramivir had higher efficacy than each NAI alone. Conclusion: In conclusion, the efficacy of peramivir might be higher than that of other NAIs, and this agent is tolerated as well as other NAIs.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  influenza; neuraminidase inhibitors; peramivir\n\n PMID: \t32033501 \tDOI: \t10.3390/medicina56020063 \n  Free full text",

[Epub ahead of print]  Influenza vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization with laboratory-confirmed influenza in Greece: A pooled analysis across six seasons, 2013-2014 to 2018-2019.Mouratidou E1, Lambrou A2, Andreopoulou A2, Gioula G3, Exindari M3, Kossyvakis A4, Pogka V4, Mentis A4, Georgakopoulou T2, Lytras T2.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  Monitoring seasonal influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) is key to inform vaccination strategies and sustain uptake. Pooling data across multiple seasons increases precision and allows for subgroup analyses, providing more conclusive evidence. Our aim was to assess VE against hospitalization with laboratory-confirmed influenza in Greece over six seasons, from 2013 to 2014 to 2018-2019, using routinely collected surveillance data.\nMETHODS:  Swab samples from hospitalized patients across the country were tested for influenza by RT-PCR. We used the test-negative design, with patients testing positive for influenza serving as cases and those testing negative serving as controls. VE was calculated as one minus the Odds Ratio (OR) for influenza vaccination, estimated by mixed-effects logistic regression and adjusted for age, sex, hospitalization type (being in intensive care or not), time from symptom onset to swabbing, and calendar time. Stratified estimates by age and hospitalization type were obtained, and also subgroup estimates by influenza type/subtype and season. Antigenic and genetic characterization of a subset of circulating influenza strains was performed.\nRESULTS:  A total of 3,882 test-positive cases and 5,895 test-negative controls were analyzed. Across all seasons, adjusted VE was 45.5% (95% CI: 31.6-56.6) against all influenza, 62.8% against A(H1N1)pdm09 (95% CI: 40.7-76.7), 28.2% against A(H3N2) (95% CI: 12.0-41.3) and 45.5% against influenza B (95% CI: 29.1-58.1). VE was slightly lower for patients aged 60 years and over, and similar between patients hospitalized inside or outside intensive care. Circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 and B strains were antigenically similar to the vaccine strains, whereas A(H3N2) were not.\nCONCLUSION:  Our results confirm the public health benefits from seasonal influenza vaccination, despite the suboptimal effectiveness against A(H3N2) strains. Continued monitoring of VE is essential, and routinely collected surveillance data can be valuable in this regard.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Our objective was to assess the effect of trivalent influenza vaccines (IIV3) during pregnancy on parent report 6-month infant development.\nMETHODS:  We conducted a multi-site prospective birth cohort study during the 2010-2011 influenza season and followed pregnant women and their newborns through 6 months of age. Information on IIV3 during pregnancy was ascertained from the EHR and self-report. The Ages and Stages Questionnaire-3 (ASQ-3) was completed by the mother to assess 6-month infant neurodevelopment in five domains (communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem-solving, and personal adaptive skills). Scores for each domain above the cut-off point indicating typical development were categorized as \"on schedule\" while scores in the zones indicating the need for either monitoring or further assessment were categorized as \"not on schedule\". Multivariable logistic regression was conducted.\nRESULTS:  Of the 1225 infant-mother pairs, 65% received IIV3 during pregnancy. In bivariate analysis, infants of women who received IIV3 during pregnancy were moderately-less likely to need monitoring or further assessment in the personal social domain compared with infants of unvaccinated women (10.0% vs. 14.1%, p = 0.033; crude OR (cOR): 0.68(95%CI:0.48,0.97)). However, after controlling for potential confounders, the findings were no longer statistically significant (aOR:0.72,95%CI: 0.49,1.06,p = 0.46). No significant unadjusted or adjusted associations emerged in any other ASQ-3 domain.\nCONCLUSION:  There was no significant association between IIV3 exposure during pregnancy and 6-month infant development.

Glycan repositioning of influenza hemagglutinin stem facilitates the elicitation of protective cross-group antibody responses.Boyoglu-Barnum S1, Hutchinson GB1, Boyington JC1, Moin SM1, Gillespie RA1, Tsybovsky Y2, Stephens T2, Vaile JR1, Lederhofer J1, Corbett KS1, Fisher BE1, Yassine HM3, Andrews SF1, Crank MC1, McDermott AB1, Mascola JR1, Graham BS4, Kanekiyo M5.\nAuthor informationAbstract   The conserved hemagglutinin (HA) stem has been a focus of universal influenza vaccine efforts. Influenza A group 1 HA stem-nanoparticles have been demonstrated to confer heterosubtypic protection in animals; however, the protection does not extend to group 2 viruses, due in part to differences in glycosylation between group 1 and 2 stems. Here, we show that introducing the group 2 glycan at Asn38HA1 to a group 1 stem-nanoparticle (gN38 variant) based on A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) broadens antibody responses to cross-react with group 2 HAs. Immunoglobulins elicited by the gN38 variant provide complete protection against group 2 H7N9 virus infection, while the variant loses protection against a group 1 H5N1 virus. The N38HA1 glycan thus is pivotal in directing antibody responses by controlling access to group-determining stem epitopes. Precise targeting of stem-directed antibody responses to the site of vulnerability by glycan repositioning may be a step towards achieving cross-group influenza protection.\n\n\n PMID: \t32034141 \tPMCID: \tPMC7005838 \tDOI: \t10.1038/s41467-020-14579-4 \nFree PMC Article",

It is unknown from which anatomical site of the respiratory tract influenza A virus transmission occurs. Here, pairs of genetically tagged and untagged influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and A/H5N1 viruses that are transmissible via the air are used to co-infect donor ferrets via the intranasal and intratracheal routes to cause an upper and lower respiratory tract infection, respectively. In all transmission cases, we observe that the viruses in the recipient ferrets are of the same genotype as the viruses inoculated intranasally, demonstrating that they are expelled from the upper respiratory tract of ferrets rather than from trachea or the lower airways. Moreover, influenza A viruses that are transmissible via the air preferentially infect ferret and human nasal respiratory epithelium. These results indicate that virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, the nasal respiratory epithelium in particular, of donors is a driver for transmission of influenza A viruses via the air.\n\n\nPMID: 32034144 PMCID: PMC7005743 DOI: 10.1038/s41467-020-14626-0\nFree PMC Article",

We also found fever durations to be similar between patients with or without the variants, but the patients with variants shed the virus 3 days longer and took longer to improve clinical symptoms than those without variants. The emergence of these variants should be monitored during future influenza seasons.\n  \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (ARF), chiefly due to pulmonary infection, is the leading reason for ICU admission. Identifying the cause of ARF increases the chances of survival, but may be extremely challenging, as the underlying disease, treatments, and infection combine to create complex clinical pictures. In addition, there may be more than one infectious agent, and the pulmonary manifestations may be related to both infectious and non-infectious insults. Clinically or microbiologically documented bacterial pneumonia accounts for one-third of cases of ARF in immunocompromised patients. Early antibiotic therapy is recommended but decreases the chances of identifying the causative organism(s) to about 50%. Viruses are the second most common cause of severe respiratory infections. Positive tests for a virus in respiratory samples do not necessarily indicate a role for the virus in the current acute illness. Invasive fungal infections (Aspergillus, Mucorales, and Pneumocystis jirovecii) account for about 15% of severe respiratory infections, whereas parasites rarely cause severe acute infections in immunocompromised patients. This review focuses on the diagnosis of severe respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients. Special attention is given to newly validated diagnostic tests designed to be used on non-invasive samples or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and capable of increasing the likelihood of an early etiological diagnosis.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Aspergillosis; Cytomegalovirus; Influenza; Mucormycosis; Pneumocystis pneumonia; Toxoplasmosis\n\n PMID: \t32034433 \tDOI: \t10.1007/s00134-019-05906-5",

Thus, the development of rapid, specific, and sensitive detection methods is urgently required. Herein, two specific monoclonal antibodies against H7N9 AIV were produced to develop a colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic test strip to detect H7N9 AIV. High specificity, repeatability, and sensitivity were achieved, with a detection limit of two hemagglutinin units or 102.55 50% tissue culture infective dose. This assay may represent a powerful tool to rapidly detect H7N9 influenza viruses in the future.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Avian influenza virus; Colloidal gold; Detection; H7N9; Monoclonal antibody\n\n PMID: \t32034616 \tDOI: \t10.1007/s11262-020-01742-8",

This is associated with increased mortality in pediatric influenza critical illness. Whether anti-viral immune signaling pathways are also suppressed in these patients is unclear.\nOBJECTIVES:  We evaluated suppression of the TLR4 and the anti-viral retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) pathways with clinical outcomes in children with severe influenza infection.\nMETHODS:  In this 24-center, prospective, observational cohort study of children with confirmed influenza infection, blood was collected within 72 hours of intensive care unit admission. Ex vivo whole blood stimulations were performed with matched controls using the viral ligand, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C))-low molecular weight/LyoVecTM and LPS to evaluate interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 production capacities (RIG-I and TLR4 pathways, respectively).\nRESULTS:  Suppression of either IFN\u03b1 or TNF\u03b1 production capacity was associated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation and hospitalization, and increased organ dysfunction. Children with suppression of both RIG-I and TLR4 pathways (n=33/103, 32%) were more likely to have prolonged (\u22657 days) multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (30.3% vs 8.6%, p=0.004) or prolonged hypoxic respiratory failure (39.4% vs 11.4% p=0.001) compared to those with single- or no pathway suppression.\nCONCLUSIONS:  Suppression of both RIG-I and TLR4 signaling pathways, essential for respective anti-viral and anti-bacterial pathogens responses, is common in previously immunocompetent children with influenza-related critical illness and is associated with bacterial co-infection and adverse outcomes. Prospective testing of both pathways may aid in risk-stratification and in immune monitoring.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020.

Influenza co-infection leads to increased susceptibility to secondary pneumonia and mortality during influenza epidemics. Increased bacterial load and impaired immune responses to pneumococcus caused by influenza play a role in this increased susceptibility. Using an Experimental Human Challenge Model and influenza vaccines, we examined symptoms experienced by healthy adults during nasal co-infection with S. pneumoniae and live attenuated influenza virus.\nMETHODS:  Randomised, blinded administration of Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) or Tetravalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (TIV) either preceded bacterial inoculation or followed it, separated by a 3-day interval. The presence and density of S. pneumoniae was determined from nasal washes. Participants completed a symptom questionnaire from the first intervention until 6 days post second intervention.\nRESULTS:  The timing and type of influenza vaccination and presence of S. pneumoniae in the nasopharynx significantly affected symptom reporting. In the study where influenza vaccination preceded bacterial inoculation: nasal symptoms were less common in the LAIV group than the TIV group (OR 0.57, p < 0.01); with colonisation status only affecting the TIV group where more symptoms were reported by colonised participants compared to non-colonised participants following inoculation (n = 12/23 [52.17%] vs n = 13/38 [34.21%], respectively; p < 0.05). In the study where influenza vaccination followed bacterial inoculation: no difference was seen in the symptoms reported between the LAIV and TIV groups following inoculation and subsequent vaccination; and symptoms were unaffected by colonisation status.\nCONCLUSION:  Symptoms experienced during live viral vaccination and bacterial co-infection in the nasopharynx are directly affected by the precedence of the pathogen acquisition. Symptoms were directly affected by nasal pneumococcal colonisation but only when TIV was given prior to bacterial exposure.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020.

Recent improvements to influenza vaccines include a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) and a TIV adjuvanted with the squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion MF59.\nMETHODS:  Pre- and post-vaccination serum samples from older adults vaccinated with QIV (n = 27) and adjuvanted TIV (n = 44) were studied using hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays and dimeric Fc-gamma receptor IIIa binding ELISAs, as a surrogate of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).\nRESULTS:  We found that the unadjuvanted QIV elicited a stronger HAI response against the H1N1 vaccine virus than the adjuvanted TIV. Post-vaccination levels of HA-specific ADCC antibodies were similar for older adults vaccinated with QIV and adjuvanted TIV. The ADCC response to influenza vaccination was largely determined by pre-vaccination or baseline levels of these antibodies, with older adults with low baseline levels of ADCC activity demonstrating greater post-vaccination rises.\nCONCLUSIONS:  In this cohort of community-dwelling older adults, the QIV was at least as good as the adjuvanted TIV in the induction of ADCC and HAI responses.

In a recent study of influenza vaccination, it was observed that vaccinated yet infected individuals experienced increased transmission levels. In this paper, using a mathematical model of infection and transmission, we study the impact of vaccine-modified effects, including susceptibility and infectivity, on important epidemiological outcomes of an immunization program. The balance between vaccine-modified susceptibility, infectivity and recovery needed in preventing an influenza outbreak, or in mitigating the health outcomes of the outbreak is studied using the SIRV-type of disease transmission model. We also investigate the impact of influenza vaccination program on the infection risk of vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020.

Characterization of viral, bacterial, and parasitic causes of disease in small-scale chicken flocks in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam.Van NTB1, Yen NTP2, Nhung NT2, Cuong NV2, Kiet BT3, Hoang NV3, Hien VB3, Chansiripornchai N4, Choisy M5, Ribas A6, Campbell J7, Thwaites G7, Carrique-Mas J7.\nAuthor informationAbstract   In the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam, small-scale chicken farming is common. However, high levels of disease or mortality in such flocks impair economic development and challenge the livelihoods of many rural households. We investigated 61 diseased small-scale flocks (122 chickens) for evidence of infection with 5 bacteria, 4 viruses, and helminths. Serological profiles (ELISA) were also determined against 6 of these pathogens. The aims of this study were the following: (1) to investigate the prevalence of different pathogens and to compare the probability of detection of bacterial pathogens using PCR and culture; (2) to investigate the relationship between detection of organisms in birds' tissues and the observed morbidity and mortality, as well as their antibody profile; and (3) to characterize risk factors for infection with specific viral or bacterial pathogens. We used PCR to test for viral (viruses causing infectious bronchitis [IB], highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI], Newcastle disease, and infectious bursal disease [IBD]) and bacterial pathogens (Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Pasteurella multocida, Avibacterium paragallinarum, and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale [ORT]). The latter two were also investigated in respiratory tissues by conventional culture. Colisepticemic Escherichia coli was investigated by liver or spleen culture. In 49 of 61 (80.3%) flocks, at least one bacterial or viral pathogen was detected, and in 29 (47.5%) flocks, more than one pathogen was detected. A. paragallinarum was detected in 62.3% flocks, followed by M. gallisepticum (26.2%), viruses causing IBD (24.6%) and IB (21.3%), septicemic E. coli (14.8%), ORT (13.1%), and HPAI viruses (4.9%). Of all flocks, 67.2% flocks were colonized by helminths. Mortality was highest among flocks infected with HPAI (100%, interquartile range [IQR]: 81.6-100%) and lowest with flocks infected with ORT (5.3%, IQR: 1.1-9.0%). The results indicated slight agreement (kappa \u2264 0.167) between detection by PCR and culture for both A. paragallinarum and ORT, as well as between the presence of cestodes and ORT infection (kappa = 0.317). Control of A. paragallinarum, viruses causing HPAI, IBD, and IB, M. gallisepticum, and gastrointestinal helminths should be a priority in small-scale flocks.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2019.

[Epub ahead of print]  Shades of gray in vaccination decisions - Understanding community pharmacists' perspectives of, and experiences with, influenza vaccine hesitancy in Ontario, Canada.Pullagura GR1, Violette R2, Houle SKD3, Waite NM4.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:  Vaccine hesitancy (VH) has been increasingly recognized as a global threat to public health. Yet, limited research exists exploring healthcare providers' experience of this phenomenon. Our study aims to understand community pharmacists' attitudes towards, and experiences with, influenza VH, and explore factors impacting their engagement with patients on the influenza vaccine.\nMETHODS:  A semi-structured interview guide was developed, and interviews were conducted to saturation with community pharmacists practicing in Ontario, Canada. Interview data was transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a thematic content analysis framework. The analysis yielded 110 unique codes, which were merged into five major themes and 15 sub-themes.\nRESULTS:  A total of 22 pharmacists were interviewed to achieve saturation. Most pharmacists were authorized to administer injections (n = 20, 90.9%) and practiced for >20 years (n = 16, 72.7%). Pharmacists' engagement with patients on the influenza vaccine was found to be modulated by a complex and mutually reinforcing constellation of attitudes and behaviours which include: a binary (pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine) perception of patient vaccination decisions; a conflation of those expressing hesitancy with those who are anti-vaccine; and a passive approach to patient engagement, wherein patients were found to be the primary initiators of vaccine conversations. Although pharmacists recognized the importance of educating patients and addressing their vaccine-related concerns, barriers such as limited time, inadequate staffing, and poor remuneration were found to restrict optimal patient engagement on influenza vaccinations.\nCONCLUSION:  While pharmacists hold the potential to effectively address influenza VH within their communities, future interventions must aim to break the loop of passive patient engagement and enable proactive pharmacist-patient interactions on influenza vaccinations in this setting.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020.

Droplet-Transmitted Infection Risk Ranking Based on Close Proximity Interaction.Guo S1, Yu J1, Shi X1, Wang H1, Xie F2, Gao X1, Jiang M1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   We propose an automatic method to identify people who are potentially-infected by droplet-transmitted diseases. This high-risk group of infection was previously identified by conducting large-scale visits/interviews, or manually screening among tons of recorded surveillance videos. Both are time-intensive and most likely to delay the control of communicable diseases like influenza. In this paper, we address this challenge by solving a multi-tasking problem from the captured surveillance videos. This multi-tasking framework aims to model the principle of Close Proximity Interaction and thus infer the infection risk of individuals. The complete workflow includes three essential sub-tasks: (1) person re-identification (REID), to identify the diagnosed patient and infected individuals across different cameras, (2) depth estimation, to provide a spatial knowledge of the captured environment, (3) pose estimation, to evaluate the distance between the diagnosed and potentially-infected subjects. Our method significantly reduces the time and labor costs. We demonstrate the advantages of high accuracy and efficiency of our method. Our method is expected to be effective in accelerating the process of identifying the potentially infected group and ultimately contribute to the well-being of public health.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Guo, Yu, Shi, Wang, Xie, Gao and Jiang.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  infection risk ranking; influenza-like infection; multi-person pose estimation; multi-tasking; person re-identification\n\n PMID: \t32038220 \tPMCID: \tPMC6985151 \tDOI: \t10.3389/fnbot.2019.00113 \n  Free full text",

Characterization of Influenza A Virus Infection in Mouse Pulmonary Stem/Progenitor Cells.Chao TL1, Gu SY2, Lin PH1, Chou YT1, Ling TY2, Chang SY1,3.\nAuthor informationAbstract   The pulmonary stem/progenitor cells, which could be differentiated into downstream cells to repair tissue damage caused by influenza A virus, have also been shown to be the target cells of influenza virus infection. In this study, mouse pulmonary stem/progenitor cells (mPSCs) with capability to differentiate into type I or type II alveolar cells were used as an in vitro cell model to characterize replication and pathogenic effects of influenza viruses in PSCs. First, mPSCs and its immortalized cell line mPSCsOct4+ were shown to be susceptible to PR8, seasonal H1N1, 2009 pandemic H1N1, and H7N9 influenza viruses and can generate infectious virus particles, although with a lower virus titer, which could be attributed by the reduced vRNA replication and nucleoprotein (NP) aggregation in the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, a significant increase of interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 at 12 h and IFN-\u03b2 at 24 h post infection in mPSCs implicates that mPSCs might function as a sensor to modulate immune responses to influenza virus infection. In summary, our results demonstrated mPSCs, as one of the target cells for influenza A viruses, could modulate early proinflammatory responses to influenza virus infection.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Chao, Gu, Lin, Chou, Ling and Chang.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  influenza; influenza A virus; mouse pulmonary progenitor cells; mouse pulmonary stem cells; pro-inflammatory responses\n\n PMID: \t32038512 \tPMCID: \tPMC6985155 \tDOI: \t10.3389/fmicb.2019.02942 \n  Free full text",

IL-6 During Influenza-Streptococcus pneumoniae Co-Infected Pneumonia-A Protector.Gou X1, Yuan J1, Wang H1, Wang X1, Xiao J1, Chen J2, Liu S1, Yin Y1,2, Zhang X1.\nAuthor informationAbstract   Understanding of pathogenesis and protection mechanisms underlying influenza-Streptococcus pneumoniae co-infection may provide potential strategies for decreasing its high morbidity and mortality. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an important cytokine that acts to limit infection-related inflammation; however, its role in co-infected pneumonia remains unclear. Here we show that the clinically relevant co-infected mice displayed dramatically elevated IL-6 levels; which was also observed in patients with co-infected pneumonia. IL-6 -/- mice presented with increased bacterial burden, early dissemination of bacteria to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by aggravated pulmonary lesions and high mortality when co-infection. This protective function of IL-6 is associated with cellular death and macrophage function. Importantly, therapeutic administration of recombinant IL-6 protein reduced cells death in BALF, and enhanced macrophage phagocytosis through increased MARCO expression. This protective immune mechanism furthers our understanding of the potential impact of immune components during infection and provides potential therapeutic avenues for influenza-Streptococcus pneumoniae co-infected pneumonia.\n  Copyright \u00a9 2020 Gou, Yuan, Wang, Wang, Xiao, Chen, Liu, Yin and Zhang.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  IL-6; Streptococcus pneumoniae; co-infection; influenza; pneumonia\n\n PMID: \t32038632 \tPMCID: \tPMC6985362 \tDOI: \t10.3389/fimmu.2019.03102 \n  Free full text",

[Epub ahead of print]  Partnering with parents to remove barriers and improve influenza immunization rates for young children.Bauer KE1, Agruss JC2, Mayefsky JH3.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  Despite the ongoing public health initiatives to increase pediatric influenza immunization rates to 80%, only a few US health centers have been able to meet this goal. The suboptimal immunity to influenza poses individual and societal risks for vaccine-preventable cases of influenza and its complications.\nLOCAL PROBLEM:  At a diverse, urban, family health center, its influenza immunization rate of 44% represented the lowest uptake rate compared with all other early childhood vaccines, increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality in young children, including hospitalization and death.\nMETHODS:  To identify key barriers to influenza immunization, the investigators interviewed parents of children aged 6 through 24 months at this urban family health center via randomized sampling using an open-ended telephone survey.\nINTERVENTIONS:  Based on the concerns parents expressed through the survey, a program was designed and implemented that included reminder calls, parent education, proactive appointment scheduling, and social media reminders.\nRESULTS:  After implementing a parent-driven quality-improvement program for 6 months during influenza season, the health center's pediatric influenza immunization rates rose to 57% compared with 44% during the year before.\nCONCLUSIONS:  Childhood immunization is a critical priority to protect the health and wellness of children. Increasing parent engagement in discussions about increasing immunization rates not only promotes awareness surrounding vaccines but also allows primary care providers to learn from parents to create a patient-centered immunization program. Programs that specifically target immunization efforts toward parental concerns have the potential for increased vaccine acceptance and improved health outcomes.\n\n\n PMID: \t32039962 \tDOI: \t10.1097/JXX.0000000000000381",

Vaccination is the most cost-effective prophylaxis to prevent the disease and it is particularly important for people who are at high risk of serious complications derived from influenza, especially for people \u226565 years. In Italy, the influenza vaccination program has been unsuccessful with low rates of uptake in people \u226565 years. We analyzed all the community \u226565 years of the Health Promoting Agency (HPA) of Brescia (northern Italy) to evaluate the propensity attitudes toward influenza vaccination among people \u226565 years in four consecutive seasonal influenza campaigns (from 2014/2015 to 2017/2018). Information about subjects were retrieved from administrative databases. Data from 952,822 records were analyzed. The prevalence of vaccinated subjects in the four campaigns was 38.6%, 33.7%, 37.7%, and 40.1%, respectively. Among vaccinated people, the frequencies of individuals aged 65-69.9 years were lower than the frequencies of those in the other age classes, with highest frequencies of vaccinated people in the 75-79.9 years age-class. Overall, males showed a slightly higher propensity to be vaccinated and the propensity toward vaccination increased with age in both genders. Suffering from a chronic disease increased the propensity to vaccination; hypertension had the highest impact on the propensity whereas suffering from vasculopathy has the opposite effect.The value of this study is the possibility to know the factors that might indicate a propensity to get an influenza vaccination and to consider a different approach to people \u226565 years with the characteristics indicating a lower propensity to vaccination.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Influenza vaccination; comorbidities; elderly; propensity score\n\n PMID: \t32040352 \tDOI: \t10.1080/21645515.2019.1706931",

Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) is frequently used to protect people who have a high-risk of developing influenza complications due to comorbidities. QIV offers protection against influenza A (A/H1N1 and H3N2) and B (B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata) strains. The European Medicines Agency has recently approved a cell-based QIV (QIVc) in people aged over 9 years old. QIVc has been shown to be more effective at preventing influenza than traditional egg-based QIV (QIVe). In this study, we use a health economic model adapted to Spain to assess the costs and outcomes associated with using QIVc instead of QIVe in people aged 9-64 at high-risk of complications. Observed vaccine coverage of 32% in the 9-17 age group, 17% in those aged 18-59, and 22% for ages 60-64 was used in the analysis. In total, 2.5 million people were vaccinated in the simulations. Using QIVc instead of QIVe was associated with 16,221fewer symptomatic cases, 4,522 fewer primary care visits, 1,015 fewer emergency room visits and 88 fewer hospitalizations. From a societal perspective, QIVc was more effective and less expensive compared to QIVe, leading to a cost-saving of \u20ac3.4 million. From a public payer perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for QIVc vs QIVe was \u20ac12,852 per QALY gained. In conclusion, QIVc offers a cost-effective alternative to QIVe and should be considered as an alternative vaccine to QIVe for people aged 9-64 at high-risk of influenza complications in Spain.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Influenza; Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV); Spain; burden of illness; cell-based vaccines; cost-effectiveness; high-risk; vaccination\n\n PMID: \t32040379 \tDOI: \t10.1080/21645515.2020.1712935",

Epidemiology and costs of severe acute respiratory infection and influenza hospitalizations in adults with diabetes in India.Koul PA1, Bhavsar A2, Mir H3, Simmerman M4, Khanna H5.\nAuthor informationAbstract INTRODUCTION:  The incidence of diabetes mellitus is increasing rapidly in India. In addition to well-known complications, diabetes increases the risk for hospitalization and death from severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and influenza. Here we examined the impact of SARI and influenza in Indian adults with diabetes.\nMETHODOLOGY:  This was a single-center, active surveillance study conducted in Jammu and Kashmir State, India, during the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 influenza seasons. Adults hospitalized for SARI and receiving at least one diabetes medication were included. Demographics, health care use, and direct costs were collected from medical records and interviews of patients or caregivers. Indirect costs were estimated based on lost earnings and WHO-CHOICE estimates for hospital costs.\nRESULTS:  The study included 192 patients with type 2 diabetes. Median age was 66 years, median body mass index was 26.6 kg/m2, and most patients had comorbidities, especially hypertension and cardiovascular disease (83.9%). Only 32.2% regularly monitored blood glucose or hemoglobin A1C, and median values at admission indicated poor glycemic control for most. Influenza was detected in 8.9% of cases. The median hospital stay for SARI was 8 days, and 22 patients (11.4%) died. Median total costs associated with hospitalization were US$710 (interquartile range, $539-$1067) for SARI patients and US$716 ($556-$1078) for influenza patients, mostly (~75%) from indirect costs.\nCONCLUSIONS:  Adults with diabetes in India hospitalized with SARI or influenza are generally older, in poor health, and suffer from poor glycemic control. The costs for their hospitalization and care are substantial.\n  Copyright (c) 2019 Parvaiz A Koul, Amit Bhavsar, Hyder Mir, Mark Simmerman, Hemant Khanna.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  India; diabetes mellitus; hospitalization; respiratory infections\n\n PMID: \t32040449 \tDOI: \t10.3855/jidc.10903 \n  Free full text",

Can syndromic surveillance help forecast winter hospital bed pressures in England?Morbey RA1, Charlett A2, Lake I3, Mapstone J4, Pebody R5, Sedgwick J6, Smith GE1, Elliot AJ1.\nAuthor informationAbstract BACKGROUND:  Health care planners need to predict demand for hospital beds to avoid deterioration in health care. Seasonal demand can be affected by respiratory illnesses which in England are monitored using syndromic surveillance systems. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between syndromic data and daily emergency hospital admissions.\nMETHODS:  We compared the timing of peaks in syndromic respiratory indicators and emergency hospital admissions, between 2013 and 2018. Furthermore, we created forecasts for daily admissions and investigated their accuracy when real-time syndromic data were included.\nRESULTS:  We found that syndromic indicators were sensitive to changes in the timing of peaks in seasonal disease, especially influenza. However, each year, peak demand for hospital beds occurred on either 29th or 30th December, irrespective of the timing of syndromic peaks. Most forecast models using syndromic indicators explained over 70% of the seasonal variation in admissions (adjusted R square value). Forecast errors were reduced when syndromic data were included. For example, peak admissions for December 2014 and 2017 were underestimated when syndromic data were not used in models.\nCONCLUSION:  Due to the lack of variability in the timing of the highest seasonal peak in hospital admissions, syndromic surveillance data do not provide additional early warning of timing. However, during atypical seasons syndromic data did improve the accuracy of forecast intensity.\n\n\n PMID: \t32040541 \tDOI: \t10.1371/journal.pone.0228804 \n  Free full text",

[Epub ahead of print]  Critical care management of adults with community-acquired severe respiratory viral infection.Arabi YM1,2,3, Fowler R4,5,6, Hayden FG7.\nAuthor informationAbstract   With the expanding use of molecular assays, viral pathogens are increasingly recognized among critically ill adult patients with community-acquired severe respiratory illness; studies have detected respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in 17-53% of such patients. In addition, novel pathogens including zoonotic coronaviruses like the agents causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) are still being identified. Patients with severe RVIs requiring ICU care present typically with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Oseltamivir is the most widely used neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza; data suggest that early use is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients with influenza. At present, there are no antiviral therapies of proven efficacy for other severe RVIs. Several adjunctive pharmacologic interventions have been studied for their immunomodulatory effects, including macrolides, corticosteroids, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, sirolimus, statins, anti-influenza immune plasma, and vitamin C, but none is recommended at present in severe RVIs. Evidence-based supportive care is the mainstay for management of severe respiratory viral infection. Non-invasive ventilation in patients with severe RVI causing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and pneumonia is associated with a high likelihood of transition to invasive ventilation. Limited existing knowledge highlights the need for data regarding supportive care and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy that is specific for critically ill patients with severe RVI. There is a need for more pragmatic and efficient designs to test different therapeutics both individually and in combination.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Antiviral therapy; Coronavirus; Influenza; Neuraminidase inhibitor\n\n PMID: \t32040667 \tDOI: \t10.1007/s00134-020-05943-5",

And it has to be pronounceable and related to the disease.\n  In a related development today, the coronavirus study group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses\u2014which is tasked with officially classifying and naming viruses\u2014announced that the name of the virus is SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). The group detailed the naming process in the preprint server bioRxiv.\n  So SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19.\nUN crisis team formed  Tedros also announced that the WHO has activated a United Nations crisis management team, which will be headed by Mike Ryan, MD, who directs the WHO's health emergencies program.  He said the team will help the WHO focus on its health mission, while other UN groups add their expertise on the wider social and economic implications of the outbreak.\n  Also today, the WHO began a 2-day research meeting, pulling in about 400 global experts to chart a roadmap of questions that still need to be answered about the virus and the outbreak and how to go about answering them. He said drugs and vaccine are an important part of the research agenda. \"The first vaccine could be ready in 18 months, so we have to do everything today using the available weapons to fight this virus, while preparing for the long term,\" Tedros said.\n  Tedros today warned that China's strong measures at the start of the outbreak provides an opportunity for the world to contain the virus, but he said he worries that the opportunity may soon be lost. \"That's why we have to use the window of opportunity. If we don't, we could have far more cases\u2014and far higher costs\u2014on our hands,\" he said. \"I don't think anybody wants that. This is a common enemy.\"\n  At the briefing, Ryan said the outbreak response In Wuhan has transitioned to a different phase, now that two large hospitals have been built and plans are in place to handle sick people. He said Chinese health officials are now pushing surveillance efforts out into the community to find cases, identify contacts, and identify transmission chains.\nChina's deaths top 1,000  Earlier today, China reported 2,478 new cases, down from 3,062 new cases reported yesterday, for an overall total of 42,638 illnesses. Officials continue to report a steady stream of new deaths\u2014they reported 108 today, raising the outbreak's fatality count to 1,016, according to the latest update from the country's National Health Commission (NHC).\n  The country added 849 more serious cases, pushing that total to 7,333. So far, 3,996 people have been discharged from the hospital.\n  Four of China's provinces now have more than 1,000 cases: Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan, and Hubei, according to the WHO's daily situation report. Hubei province, however, still has the strong majority of cases, with nearly 32,000 reported so far.\nHundreds of health workers infected in Wuhan  At least 500 healthcare workers were diagnosed as having COVID-19 by the middle of January, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported today, based on multiple hospital sources. The revelations fly in the face of earlier official reports from China that said healthcare worker infections were not a feature of the outbreak.\n  Hospital outbreaks, including infections in both healthcare workers and patients, have been a feature in other coronavirus outbreaks, including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus). Earlier in the new outbreak, global health officials were eager to see if the pattern held for COVID-19, not only because they were worried about the workers at the outbreak's frontlines, but also to see if the virus was spreading easily among people\u2014a key factor in forming their risk assessments.\n  So far, China had just acknowledged one cluster of 14 or 15 cases in a Wuhan hospital. Then on Feb 7, Chinese scientists in an overview of 138 patients at Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan revealed that hospital-related transmission was responsible for 41% of the illnesses, which include 40 healthcare workers and 17 patients.\n  The SCMP report today said doctors and nurses were told not to make public the number of healthcare worker infections in Wuhan hospitals. However, a slide circulating online showed that by the middle of January there were about 500 confirmed healthcare worker infections, with 600 more suspected. Doctors told the SCMP that they were faced with a shortage of protective gear, long working hours, and an unclear picture of how well the virus was spreading.\n  The new report comes just days after a Wuhan doctor died from COVID-19 after he, along with others, were reprimanded for raising the initial alarm about a possible SARS-like outbreak linked to a local seafood market. The death of Li Wenliang, MD, sparked a public outcry about China's attempts to censor doctors' concerns early on in the outbreak and about the risks to healthcare workers.\nUS case raises total to 13  University of California San Diego (UCSD) Health today said it is evaluating two patients from the Miramar neighborhood of San Diego for COVID-19, one of whom tested positive and the other who is considered a person under investigation.\n  On Twitter, the hospital said both patients are doing well and have minimal symptoms. The case brings the United States' total to 13, which now includes 7 in California.\n  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in confirming the case today, said the patient was under federal quarantine after recently returning from Wuhan. The CDC said it is tracing his or her contacts to assess if any had high-risk exposure.\n  A report from CNN said the patient is a woman who was sent back to quarantine at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar instead of being isolated at the hospital, following a mix-up in test specimens in which three other people tested negative.\nOther new cases outside of China  Elsewhere, at least three countries reported more cases, including:Japan's health ministry today reported 2 new illnesses, both in people evacuated from Wuhan, raising the country's total to 25.\nSingapore's health ministry reported 2 more cases, both of them locally acquired, raising the country's total to 47. One had worked at a casino and the other is a Bangladeshi citizen who had worked at the same location as an earlier case.\nVietnam's health ministry reported its 15th case, apparently a local infection involving a 3-month-old baby who is the grandchild of a patient whose illness was confirmed 2 days ago.\nThe WHO said it received reports of 76 more COVID-19 cases outside of China yesterday, raising the total to 395 in 24 countries.\nSee also:\n  Feb 11 bioRxiv report\n  Feb 11 China NHC update\n  Feb 11 WHO daily situation report\n  Feb 11 SCMP story\n  Feb 11 UCSD Health tweet\n  Feb 11 CDC statement\n  Feb 11 CNN report\n  Feb 11 Japan health ministry statement on 24th case\n  Feb 11 Japan health ministry statement on 25th case\n  Feb 11 Singapore health ministry statement\n  Feb 11 Vietnam health ministry statement",

Bright, Ph.D. \"With emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19, speed is crucial to saving lives and reducing further spread of the virus. Janssen is a proven partner with a flexible, rapid, vaccine platform which gives us an edge in the race to protect people in the U.S. and worldwide from the health security threat posed by this novel coronavirus.\"\n\nJanssen also will work on the scale-up of production and manufacturing capacities required to manufacture the candidate vaccine. This same approach was used to develop and manufacture Janssen's investigational Ebola vaccine with BARDA support; that vaccine is being used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as part of the current Ebola outbreak response.\n\nIn addition to an investigational Ebola vaccine, the BARDA and Janssen partnership has supported development of other products and technologies to help save lives in public health emergencies, including a treatment for blood injuries caused by acute levels of radiation and a treatment for injuries caused by inhaled sulfur mustard. The partnership also has supported two JLABS respiratory protection technology innovation challenges and established a health security innovation zone at the new JLABS@Washington DC facility to spur breakthrough technologies needed for health security.\n\nThere is currently no approved vaccine, treatment, or diagnostic for novel coronavirus infections; however, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to enable emergency use of a diagnostic test developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn addition to expanded collaboration with Janssen, BARDA is working with counterparts across the government, including within HHS and with the Department of Defense. The team is reviewing potential vaccines, treatments and diagnostics from across the public and private sectors, particularly products in development for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), to identify promising candidates for development to detect, protect against or treat people with novel coronavirus infections.\n\nTo obtain information about any potential products in development in the private sector that could be used in responding to the novel coronavirus outbreak, this task force launched a single point-of-entry website for innovators and product developers to submit brief descriptions of their relevant diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, and other products or technologies. The task force is particularly interested in identifying products and technologies that have progressed into or beyond non-clinical studies, have established large-scale commercial Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) manufacturing capability, or utilize an FDA-cleared diagnostic platform.\n\nTo further support the novel coronavirus response, BARDA also opened an easy broad agency announcement, an EZ-BAA, specific to diagnostics that utilize FDA-cleared platforms, with a viable plan to meet requirements for the FDA to consider issuing an EUA within 12 weeks of an award.\n\nAbout HHS, ASPR, and BARDA\n\nHHS works to enhance and protect the health and well-being of all Americans, providing for effective health and human services and fostering advances in medicine, public health, and social services. The mission of ASPR is to save lives and protect Americans from 21st century health security threats. Within ASPR, BARDA invests in innovation, advanced research and development, acquisition, and manufacturing of medical countermeasures \u2013 vaccines, drugs, therapeutics, diagnostic tools, and non-pharmaceutical products needed to combat health security threats. To date, 54 BARDA-supported products have achieved regulatory approval, licensure or clearance. BARDA DRIVe brings together the best ideas from the medical and scientific communities, together with government and venture capital investment, to drive innovation that will strengthen our nation's health security.

In addition, 86 white-tailed deer and 53 mule deer tested positive. CWD is a deadly neurologic prion disease that affects cervids (members of the deer family). Though the disease has not yet jumped to humans, some experts fear it could mimic bovine spongiform encephalopathy (\"mad cow\" disease).\n  In 2019, MFWP officials reported new CWD-positive areas in northwestern Montana near Libby, southwestern Montana near Sheridan and Twin Bridges, and in eastern and southeastern Montana. They also expanded the boundaries of known CWD-positive areas with new detections south of Highway 2 in northern Montana and north of the Yellowstone River in south-central Montana.\n  Among CWD-positive hunting districts, estimated disease prevalence ranged from less than 1% to 7% in mule deer and less than 1% to 4% in white-tailed deer, the MFWP said. In Libby, 13% of hunter-harvested or trapped white-tailed deer were positive for CWD, and 4% were positive outside of town within the Libby CWD management zone.\n  CWD was first discovered in the wild in Montana in 2017. Since then, the MFWP has tested 11,020 samples statewide.\nFeb 7 MFWP news release\n\nCWD expands range in Tennessee, with 2 newly affected counties  With two newly affected counties and a new county at high risk of CWD, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA) is encouraging more hunting to slow the spread of the disease, WTVF of Nashville reported.\n  \"We need them to harvest animals because that's going to be one of the biggest ways were going to be able to control this disease and contain it,\" said TWRA information specialist Barry Cross.\n  For the first time, deer in Haywood and Chester counties in western Tennessee tested positive for CWD, according to a Jan 16 TWRA news release. And Lauderdale County, also in the west but bordering Arkansas, has been added to the state's list of high-risk counties after a deer in adjoining Tipton County tested positive within 10 miles of Lauderdale County.\n  \"These changes are unfortunate, but were expected considering high prevalence rates in Hardeman and Fayette counties,\" said Chuck Yoest, TWRA's CWD coordinator. \"The high prevalence there indicates CWD has been present in southwest Tennessee for years. However, in the rest of the state, surveillance results have us confident CWD is not present in the remainder of the state.\"\n  The TWRA tested more than 13,000 deer for CWD during the 2019-20 hunting season.\nJan 31 WTVF story\nJan 16 TWRA news release",

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, announced the meeting today at the start of a media briefing that primarily addressed the COVID-19 novel coronavirus outbreak.\n  The meeting will be the emergency committee's sixth; its last meeting was held in the middle of October. WHO emergency committees typically meet every 3 months or as needed to assess the latest developments. At the media briefing today, Tedros said though the world is now focused on coronavirus, \"we cannot and must not forget Ebola.\"\n  He said, however, that health officials are encouraged by the current trend; only three cases were reported over the past week, and no cases have been reported in the past 3 days. \"But until we have no cases for 42 days, it's not over. As you know, any single case could reignite this epidemic, and the security situation in the eastern DRC remains extremely fragile.\" According to the WHO's online Ebola dashboard, the outbreak total remains at 3,431 cases, 2,249 of them fatal. Outbreak responders are still investigating 441 suspected cases.\n  The WHO's African regional office said in its weekly outbreaks and emergencies report today that the main hot spot is Beni in North Kivu province, but ongoing insecurity in other areas is still a concern. The agency added that continued access and heightened vigilance is needed to keep case investigations and contact tracing going.\nFeb 11 Tedros remarks\nFeb 11 WHO Africa weekly report\nWHO online Ebola dashboard\nOct 18, 2019, CIDRAP News story \"WHO advisors extend Ebola emergency; European regulators conditionally approve vaccine\"\n\nSaudi Arabia reports another MERS case  Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a new MERS-CoV case today, bringing the February total to five.\n  The new case involves a 68 year-old man from Hafar Al-Batin, whose exposure to MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) is listed as primary, meaning it is unlikely he contracted the virus from another person. The man's camel contact status is unknown, and he is not a healthcare worker. \n  Saudi Arabia reported 15 cases in January, including a probable healthcare-related cluster of 6 cases in Abha.\n  The WHO said in its latest monthly update that, since 2012, it has received reports of 2,499 MERS-CoV cases, at least 861 of them fatal. The vast majority of these cases were in Saudi Arabia.\nFeb 11 MOH report \n\nMali sees first Crimean-Congo fever cases in more than a decade  Health officials from Mali are warning of an outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), which has sickened 14 people, including 7 fatally. According to the WHO's weekly African regional office bulletin, the outbreak began in January in the Mopti health district.\n  The index case was a 39-year-old shepherd who quickly infected several family members. All cases except the index case are in females, and five of the seven deaths occurred in the community. \n  This is the first time in more than 10 years Mali has reported a CCHF case. According to the WHO, however, recent studies show evidence of the virus in both animals and humans in that country. \n  \"Provision of and access to healthcare services is severely compromised, with the region being categorised as hard-to-reach due to the deteriorating insecurity,\" the WHO warned. \"As a result, several of the initial cases died in the community at the beginning of the outbreak. Because of these factors, the current outbreak has the potential to escalate further.\"\nFeb 10 WHO African regional report \n\nGermany, Vietnam report avian flu outbreaks   Two countries reported highly pathogenic avian flu outbreaks today, according to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). \n  In Germany, a backyard flock of 69 poultry, including 49 laying hens, tested positive for H5N8 in Baden-Wurttemberg, in the south-central part of the county. Forty-four birds were killed by the virus, and another 25 were culled to prevent further spread.\n  The OIE said officials confirmed H5N6 in four outbreaks in Vietnam, in villages in the northeastern part of the country.

The trial was stopped early because of safety concerns, as patients receiving combination therapy had significantly higher rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) than those who received standard therapy.\nNo significant improvement, higher kidney toxicity  The purpose of the trial, conducted by investigators with the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Network and dubbed CAMERA2 (Combination Antibiotics for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus), was to test the hypothesis that combining an antistaphylococcal beta-lactam antibiotic with either daptomycin or vancomycin\u2014the standard therapies for MRSA bacteremia\u2014could improve outcomes in hospitalized adults. That hypothesis is based on in vitro research, animal studies, and small observational studies that have indicated a potential benefit.\n  The trial included 352 patients recruited from hospitals in Australia, Singapore, New Zealand, and Israel from August 2015 through July 2018. The patients were randomized 1:1 to receive the standard therapy or standard therapy plus an intravenous beta-lactam (flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cefalozin) for the first 7 days following randomization.\n  The primary outcome was a 90-day composite of mortality, persistent bacteremia at day 5, microbiologic relapse, and microbiologic treatment failure. Investigators aimed to detect a clinically meaningful absolute reduction of 12.5% in the primary end point. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality at 14, 42, and 90 days; persistent bacteremia at day 2 and 5; AKI; and microbiologic relapse and treatment failure.\n  Among the 345 patients (median age, 64) in the primary analysis, the investigators found no significant difference in the primary outcome between the two groups: The primary outcome occurred in 59 of 170 (34.7%) assigned to combination therapy and 68 of 175 (38.9%) who received standard therapy (absolute difference, -4.2%; 95% confidence interval, -14.3% to 6.0%; P = .42).\n  Analysis of secondary outcomes found that mortality did not significantly differ between the two treatment groups at any time, but persistent bacteremia at day 5 was less common in the combination therapy group (19 of 166, 11.4%) than in the standard therapy group (35 of 172, 20.3%), for an absolute difference of -8.9% (95% CI, -16.6% to -1.2%).\n  AKI, however, was significantly more common in the combination therapy group (34 of 145, 23.4%) than in those who received standard treatment (9 of 145, 6.2%) (absolute difference, 17.2%; 95% CI, 9.3% to 25.2%).\n  The difference in AKI between the two groups was first noticed by an independent data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) during an interim analysis of 220 patients in March 2018. After further analysis of data on 343 patients in July 2018 showed a significantly higher kidney toxicity in the combination treatment group, and no decrease in 90-day mortality, the DSMB recommended stopping recruitment.\n  The trial investigators say that even though the reduction in persistent bacteremia in patients who received combination therapy signaled potentially improved efficacy, the higher rates of AKI essentially erased that benefit.\n  \"Given the early termination, the trial may have been underpowered to demonstrate an improvement in the composite primary end point; however, it is likely that any potential gains in efficacy with combination therapy would be offset by the increased toxicity,\" they write.\n  They add that the lack of benefit for combination therapy demonstrated in this trial and in previous clinical trials across a broad range of patients with S aureus bacteremia \"should give pause to enthusiasm for combination therapy outside of clinical trials.\"\nLimitations noted  Among the limitations noted by the investigators is that the results are largely limited to treatment with vancomycin plus flucloxacillin or cloxacillin, as daptomycin and cefazolin were infrequently used in the trial. In a post hoc analysis of the combination treatment group, 27% of patients (30 of 111) who received flucloxacillin or cloxacillin developed AKI, compared with 3.7% of patients (1 of 27) who received cefazolin.\n  Taking this into account, Tejal Gandhi, MD, and Preeti Malani, MD, of the University of Michigan, write in an accompanying editorial, the results raise the question of whether there are particular antibiotic combinations that could improve outcomes for MRSA bacteremia without increased toxicity.\n  \"If so, could better outcomes be accomplished with more cost-effective regimens, such as vancomycin and cefazolin, compared with more expensive combinations, such as daptomycin and ceftaroline?\" they ask.\n  Gandhi and Malani say that and other questions, including whether the source of bacteremia or the age or comorbidities of the patients influence the therapeutic strategy, deserve further investigation, since many MRSA bacteremia patients treated with standard therapy still experience treatment failure, and the associated mortality rate has remained at 20% to 25%. But for now, they conclude, combination therapy does not appear to be the answer.\n  \"Until such data are available, routine combination therapy with a b-lactam as initial treatment for MRSA bacteremia should be avoided,\" they write.\nSee also:\n  Feb 11 JAMA abstract\n  Feb 11 JAMA editorial abstract",

The genetic information has never been recorded before.\n\u3000\u3000The virus, named Yaravirus brasiliensis, is derived from the water god Yara in Brazilian mythology and was found on Lake Pampria in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.\n\u2191 90% of the genetic composition of the new virus is unrecognizable.

The virus consists of 80 nanometer-sized particles and its genome is very unique.\n\n\u3000\u3000In fact, by searching the viral gene database and literature, the researchers found that out of the 8,500 virion genomes, only 6 were related to the Yarra virus. The other 90% of the genes were never described and could not be identified at all. So-called orphan genes (ORFans).\n\n\u3000\u3000This mysterious amoeba virus has a nearly complete orphan genome and no doubt challenges the classification of DNA viruses. Lead authors of the study, Bernard La Scola, a virologist at the University of Marseille, France, and Jnatas S. Abraho, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil, said that no recognizable sequences or other typical viral genes could be found in the Yarra virus.

Also, health officials reported 97 more deaths and 296 more serious cases, raising those totals to 908 and 6,484, respectively.\n  So far, 3,281 people have been released from the hospital.\n  In other developments, an animal (mice) trial of a candidate mRNA vaccine against 2019-nCov launched yesterday, Xinhua, China's state news agency reported today. It said testing is at a very early stage, and the next step will be toxicity tests in larger animals.\n  In addition two genomes from environmental samples taken from the outbreak market in Wuhan have been submitted to the GISAID database, and they cluster with the early human samples, adding to evidence that the market is the focus of the outbreak, Nextstrain, an open-source pathogen genome analysis project, said today on Twitter.\nWHO advance team, R&D meeting  At a media telebriefing today, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said three members of an advance team just arrived in China to lay the groundwork for an international expert team\u2014comprising 10 to 15 people\u2014to meet with Chinese officials.  The WHO's team is led by Bruce Aylward, MD, MPH, a Canadian physician who led the launch of the WHO's health emergencies program and the WHO's West Africa Ebola outbreak response.\n  Mike Ryan, MD, who directs the WHO's health emergencies program, said the goals of the joint mission are to learn more about the nature of the 2019-nCoV threat from Chinese health officials and to exchange ideas. He added that many of the experts already know their colleagues in China, and that the joint mission offers a chance to reconnect. \"We need to give them the space to interact, and step back and let the scientists do their work,\" he said.\n  In other WHO developments, a 2-day international global research and innovation forum to lay out an international action plan to battle 2019-nCoV begins tomorrow in Geneva. It will bring together leading scientists, public health agencies, health ministries, and research funders. The end result is expected to be a research agenda, as well as a list of priorities to guide which projects groups tackle first, with an eye toward fast-tracking the development and testing of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapies.\nUK notes 4 new cases\u2014all tied to French ski resort  The United Kingdom yesterday reported its fourth case yesterday, and then four more today, all linked to a British man who contracted the virus at a meeting in Singapore, then traveled to a ski resort in Les Contamines, France, where he passed it to five people, all member of a British family\u2014four adults and a child.\n  Public Health England (PHE) said two of the UK's four new cases involve healthcare workers, who have been asked to self-isolate, The Guardian reported today, citing Yvonne Doyle, MD, MPH, the PHE's medical director. The BBC today reported that the two are general physicians and that a GP practice in Brighton has been closed after a staff member tested positive.\n  In a related development, Spanish health officials said yesterday that a British man has tested positive for the virus in Mallorca, Reuters reported. He had contact with someone in France who was diagnosed as having the virus. The man's three other family members who were with him, including his wife and two daughters, have tested negative. Spain has now recorded two cases.\n  At today's media briefing, Tedros said the WHO is worried about instances of onward transmission, such as those occurring in France and the United Kingdom, which he called a small spark that becomes part of a bigger fire. \"Right now it's a spark, and the goal is containment,\" he said.\n  Ryan said 12 cases outside of China have been linked to a business meeting at a hotel in Singapore, which he said isn't classified as a super-spreading event.\nCruise ship total grows to 135  Japan's health ministry today reported that 65 more passengers on the quarantined cruise ship have tested positive for 2019-nCoV, raising the total to 135, according to a health ministry statement.\n  The Diamond Princess has been in Yokohama port since Feb 3.\n  The WHO said in its situation report yesterday that the main quarantine period will end on Feb 19, but quarantine will be extended beyond that for close contacts of the newly confirmed cases. Boat passengers are asked to stay in their cabins and wear a mask when they need to leave their cabins.\nNew CFR estimate; more cases outside of China  In its fourth analysis on the outbreak today, which focuses on outbreak severity, the MRC Center for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College of London today estimated that the overall case fatality ratio (CFR) is 1%. For cases in travelers outside of mainland China, which involve a mix of severe and milder cases, they estimated the CFR to be 1% to 5%. And for cases in Hubei, which tilt toward severe cases, the group estimated the CFR to be 18%.\n  The group cautioned that the estimates don't reflect underlying differences in disease severity among countries, and they added that CFRs in different countries will vary based on how sensitive surveillance systems are at picking up different severity levels and the type of clinical care that severely ill patients receive.\n  \"All CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously at the current time, as the sensitivity of surveillance of both deaths and cases in mainland China is unclear,\" they wrote, noting that data on time intervals from symptom onset to death or recovery influences CFR estimates.\n  Meanwhile:Singapore today reported two more cases, one of them locally acquired and one involving an evacuee from Wuhan, the health ministry said in an update. The country now has 45 cases, some of which involve three known clusters, including the private business meeting linked to a handful of exported cases.\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) today reported its eighth case, the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean regional office said today on Twitter. In another tweet, the UAE's health ministry said the patient is an Indian national and that the earlier reported patients are in stable condition, except for one who is in the intensive care unit.\nIn its situation report today, the WHO said that over the last 24 hours it received reports of 12 more 2019-nCov cases detected outside of China, raising the total to 319, 1 of them fatal, from 24 countries.\nSee also:\n  Feb 10 China NHC daily update\n  Feb 10 Xinhua story\n  Feb 10 Nextstrain tweet\n  Feb 10 Guardian story\n  Feb 10 BBC story\n  Feb 9 Reuters story\n  Feb 10 Japanese health ministry statement\n  Feb 9 WHO situation report\n  Feb 10 Imperial College London report\n  Feb 10 Singapore health ministry update\n  Feb 10 WHO EMRO tweet\n  Feb 10 UAE health ministry tweet",

The WHO also noted 123 probable cases, and 441 suspected cases still under investigation.\n  Since the outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces began in August 2018, 2,249 people have died from Ebola.\n  Over the weekend the DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said the single case reported was from Beni, the current hot spot for the virus.\n  The CMRE also updated vaccine totals, with 11,313 people having received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to date, and 290,516 having received Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV.\nWHO Ebola dashboard\nFeb 8 CMRE report\nThree more Saudi MERS cases reported  Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health (MOH) has reported three more MERS-CoV cases over the weekend and through today, bringing the February total to four.\n  The two cases reported today include a 53-year-old man in Dammam whose exposure to MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) is listed as primary, but whose contact with camels is unknown. The other is a 47-year-old man from Mecca classified as a primary case with unknown camel contact. A case reported on Feb 8 involved a 55-year-old man in Al Jouf with primary exposure and unknown camel contact. None of the men are healthcare workers.\n  Saudi Arabia reported 15 cases in January, including a probable healthcare-related cluster of 6 cases in Abha.\n  The WHO said in its latest monthly update that, since 2012, it has received reports of 2,499 MERS-CoV cases, at least 861 of them fatal. Most of these cases were from Saudi Arabia.\nFeb 10 MOH report\nFeb 8 MOH report\n\nElectronic medical record intervention linked to fewer C diff test orders  An electronic medical record (EMR) \"nudge\" implemented at four hospitals in an academic medical network was associated with a reduction in inappropriate and total hospital-onset Clostridioides difficile infection (HO-CDI) orders, researchers from Emory University School of Medicine reported today in Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology.\n  The retrospective study analyzed a 2-year period before and 2 years after the four hospitals implemented a popup notification in the EMR that was triggered when providers entered a C difficile test order for patients who had received a laxative or stool softener within the previous 24 hours\u2014an order defined as inappropriate. No other system interventions to reduce HO-CDI testing were implemented during the study period. The primary outcome was the change in the rates of total and inappropriate HO-CDI orders per 1,000 patient days between the pre- and post-intervention periods.\n  Of the 17,694 HO-CDI test orders assessed in the study, 7% were inappropriate, and the intervention was associated with a decrease in the proportion of inappropriate orders (8% in the pre-intervention period vs. 6% in the post-intervention period). In addition, monthly HO-CDI orders decreased by 21% post-intervention (rate ratio [RR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.86), and there was a modest continuing decline in order rate (trend change after RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.0).\n  In the interrupted time series analysis, the intervention was not significantly associated with an immediate decrease in the inappropriate HO-CDI order rate (level change RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.05). However, after the intervention, the order rate significantly decreased with time (trend change after intervention RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93 to 0.97).\n  \"Implementing an EMR nudge is a relatively simple method that can help healthcare systems improve diagnostic efficiency and limit the number of C. difficile tests ordered,\" the authors write. \"However, depending on individual hospital practices, this intervention alone may not be sufficient to reduce HO-CDI rates.\"\nFeb 10 Infect Control Hosp Epidem abstract\nPAHO reports record-setting dengue activity in 2019  The WHO's Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) published an epidemiologic update on dengue in the Americas, noting that 2019 showed the highest dengue activity on record.\n  In total in 2019, PAHO tracked 3,139,335 cases of dengue (321.58 cases per 100,000 population), including 1,538 deaths.\n  \"The number of cases reported in 2019 through EW 52 (3,139,335) is the largest recorded in the history of dengue in the Americas, exceeding the number of cases reported in the 2015-2016 epidemic period by 30%,\" PAHO said. \"In 2019, the proportion of severe dengue (0.9%) has exceeded that observed in the previous four years; however, it is below that observed between 2010-2014 (ranging 1.35% to 3.05%).\"\n  So far in 2020, 155,343 dengue cases have been reported, including 28 deaths. Bolivia, Honduras, Mexico, and Paraguay are all showing higher case counts than this time last year, PAHO said.\n  A total of 34 countries in the Americas reported dengue in 2019, with Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico, and Nicaragua reporting three times more cases than the previous year. Nicaragua, Beliza, and Honduras had the highest rates of case incidence.\nFeb 7 PAHO report\n\nFour countries report avian flu outbreaks  Three Asian countries (China, Vietnam, and Taiwan), as well as Scotland, have reported avian flu outbreaks in recent days, according to the World Organization for Animal Health  (OIE), Reuters, and the BBC.\n  China's agriculture ministry said a highly pathogenic H5N6 strain of avian flu had been found in a poultry farm in southwestern Sichuan province, Reuters reported. The ministry said 1,840 birds had died in the farm of 2,497, and the remainder had been culled to curb the spread of the virus.\n  Vietnam also reported three H5N6 outbreaks in villages, which sickened 1,280 birds and resulted in the slaughtering of 14,525 more. The villages are near each other, in the northeastern corner of the country. H5N5 was detected in Taipei City, Taiwan, in a poultry slaughterhouse. Fifteen birds died, the OIE said.\n  Finally, poultry farmers in Scotland are on high alert after highly pathogenic avian flu was detected in a free-range laying flock, the BBC reported. Officials suspected the flock contracted the virus from wild birds, but said Scottish eggs are safe to consume.\nFeb 9 Reuters story\nFeb 9 Vietnam OIE report\nFeb 10 Taipei OIE report\nFeb 10 BBC story",

PurposeThis document provides guidance for ships originating from, or stopping in, the United States to help prevent, detect, and medically manage suspected 2019-nCoV infections. As ships travel worldwide, ship management and medical staff need to be aware and respond to local jurisdictional requirements.\n\nA patient\u2019s travel and exposure history, clinical presentation, and underlying medical conditions are essential in the assessment and decision making process for patients who may need for further medical evaluation, testing, and treatment.\n\nThis document provides guidance for preventing spread of 2019-nCoV during and after a voyage, including personal protective measures for crew members.\n\nCDC will update this interim guidance to ships as needed and as additional information becomes available. Reducing the spreadCommercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, involves the movement of large numbers of people in closed and semi-closed settings. Like other close-contact environments, ships may  facilitate transmission of respiratory viruses from person to person through exposure to respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces.\n\nTo reduce spread of respiratory infections including 2019-nCoV, CDC recommends that ships encourage crew members and passengers toPostpone travel when sick\nWatch their health\nSelf-isolate and inform the onboard medical center immediately if they develop a fever (100.4oF / 38oC or higher), begin to feel feverish, or develop other signs or symptoms of sickness\nUse respiratory, cough, and hand hygieneAdvise passengers and crew of the importance of covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Dispose used tissues immediately in a disposable container (e.g., plastic bag) or a washable trash can.\nRemind passengers and crew members to wash their hands often with soap and water, especially after coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are not available, they can use a hand sanitizer containing 60%-95% alcohol).\n\nClinical evaluation of suspect casesIdentifying and isolating passengers and crew with possible symptoms of 2019-nCoV as soon as possible is needed  to minimize transmission of this virus. Cruise ship medical personnel and telemedicine providers should reference CDC\u2019s 2019-nCoV website Information Healthcare Professionals for the latest information on infection control, clinical management, collecting clinical specimens, and evaluating patients who may be sick with or who have been exposed to 2019-nCoV.\n\nSymptoms may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Patients have a fever if they feel warm to the touch, give a history of feeling feverish, or have a measured temperature of 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) or higher.  2019-nCoV infections have ranged from little-to-no symptoms to severe illness and death. The incubation period is believed to be 2\u201314 days. Cruise ship medical staff and telemedicine providers evaluating patients with fever or acute respiratory illness should obtain a detailed travel history and assess for any other potential exposures to a person with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\nAlthough routes of transmission have yet to be definitively determined, CDC recommends a cautious approach to interacting with patients under investigation.Ask such patients to wear a facemask (a surgical mask, not N-95) as soon as they are identified.\nEvaluate patients in a private room with the door closed, ideally an airborne infection isolation room, if available.\nStaff entering the room should use Standard Precautions, Contact Precautions, and Airborne Precautions, and use eye protection (such as goggles or a face shield).\nBecause the signs and symptoms of 2019-nCov are non-specific, people onboard who have fever or acute respiratory illness should be tested for influenza. CDC\u2019s influenza website also includes recommendations for the clinical use of influenza diagnostic tests, information on available tests, specimen collection, and guidance on interpreting influenza testing results. CDC has published Guidance for Cruise Ships on Influenza-like Illness (ILI) Management.\nManaging sick passengers or crew when boarding and onboardDeny boarding of a passenger or crew member who is suspected to have 2019-nCoV infection based on signs and symptoms plus travel history in China or other known exposure at the time of embarkation.\n\nIsolate passengers or crew onboard who are suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection in their cabins or quarters with the door closed until symptoms are improved. Discontinuing isolation precautions is made on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with CDC.\n\nIdeally, medical follow-up should occur in the isolated person\u2019s cabin. Coordinate visits to the onboard medical center in advance, if needed, with medical staff. Have the sick person wear a facemask before leaving their cabin. Managing passengers and crew after exposureRefer to CDC guidance for information about assessing exposure risk and recommended public health management. CDC is available for consultation on risk assessment and management of exposed passengers and crew. For consultation, contact the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100 or eocreport@cdc.gov.\n\nPassengers and crew members who have had high-risk exposures to a person suspected of having 2019-nCoV should be quarantined in their cabins. All potentially exposed passengers, cruise ship medical staff, and crew members should self-monitor under supervision of ship medical staff or telemedicine providers until 14 days after the last possible exposure. Preventing infection in crew membersEnsure your crew members are aware of theGlobal risk of 2019-nCoV during international travel\nSigns and symptoms that may indicate a sick traveler has 2019-nCoV\nRequirement for the ship\u2019s medical unit to report a traveler with suspected or known 2019-nCoV to CDC, if ship is destined for a US port\nImportance of not working on a ship while sick with fever or acute respiratory symptoms\n\nThe ship\u2019s company should also review their sick leave polices and communicate them to employees.\n\nCDC recommends that crew members who self-report or appear to have fever or acute respiratory symptoms (such as cough or shortness of breath) be immediately evaluated.\n\nIn addition to annual influenza vaccination, have crew members follow these recommendations when their work activities involve contact with passengers and other crew members who have fever or acute respiratory illness.Ask the sick person to wear a facemask if tolerated.\nMaintain a distance of 6 feet from the sick person while interviewing, escorting, or providing other assistance.\nKeep interactions with sick people as brief as possible.\nLimit the number of people who interact with sick people. To the extent possible, have a single person give care and meals to the sick person.\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.\nWash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available and if hands are not visibly soiled, use a hand sanitizer containing 60%-95% alcohol.\nProvide tissues and access to soap and water and ask the sick persons to:Cover their mouth and nose with a tissue (or facemask) when coughing or sneezing.\nThrow away used tissues immediately in a disposable container (e.g., plastic bag) or a washable trash can.\nWash their hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds.\n\nIf soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly soiled, the sick person should use a hand sanitizer containing 60%-95% alcohol.\nPersonal protective equipment and instructions for crew membersInstruct crew members and other staff who may have contact with people with symptoms of 2019-nCoV in the proper use, storage, and disposal of personal protective equipment (PPE). Wrong use or handling of PPE can increase the spread of disease.\nWear impermeable, disposable gloves if crew members need to have direct contact with sick people or potentially contaminated surfaces, rooms, or lavatories used by sick passengers and crew members. Instruct crew members to wash their hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer after removing gloves. Discard used gloves in the trash and don\u2019t wash or save for reuse. Avoid touching their faces with gloved or unwashed hands.\nWearing N-95 respirators or face masks is not generally recommended for cruise ship crew members for general work activities. Wearing face masks can be considered for cruise ship workers who can\u2019t avoid close contact with people who have fever, cough, or difficulty breathing. Crew members need annual fit testing to wear N-95 respirators.\nReportingCDC requires that ships destined for a US port of entry immediately report any death onboard or illness that meets CDC\u2019s definition of \u201cill person,\u201d including suspected cases of 2019-nCoV, to the CDC Quarantine Station with jurisdiction for the port.\n\nAdditional information for non-cruise ships: If the crew member or passenger has fever, cough, or difficulty breathing and has traveled to China in the past 14 days, please have the following information available before notifying the nearest CDC Quarantine Station:Ship\u2019s ports of call during the last 14 days\nSick crew member\u2019s embarkation date\nList of ports of call where the sick crew member disembarked during the previous 14 days\nSick crew member\u2019s measured temperature\nList of the sick crew member\u2019s signs and symptoms, including onset dates\n\nFor ships on international voyages, if an illness occurred on board, complete the Maritime Declaration of Health and send to the competent authority, according to the 2005 International Health Regulations and the national legislation of the country of disembarkation. ConsultationTo consult CDC about assessing exposure risk and identifying contacts of ill travelers and crew, clinical management, laboratory specimen collection, or infection control concerns related to 2019-nCoV, contact the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100 or eocreport@cdc.gov.  Managing passengers or crew upon disembarkationBefore arriving at a US port, vessel medical staff and telemedicine providers or a cruise line representative must discuss the disembarkation of patients suspected of having 2019-nCoV with the CDC Quarantine Station having jurisdiction for the port and with the state and local health departments. CDC quarantine officials can help communicate with state and local health departments and will work with the ship\u2019s company, port partners, and health departments to ensure safe disembarkation and medical transportation of the patient upon arrival.  Additional recommendations Personal protective equipmentInstruct crew members and other staff who may have contact with persons suspected of having 2019-nCoV in the proper storage, use (including safe donning and doffing pdf icon[PDF \u2013 3 pages]), and disposal of PPE. Wrong use or handling of PPE can increase spread of disease.  Ship suppliesShips should ensure availability of conveniently located dispensers of alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Where sinks are available, ensure handwashing supplies (such as soap, disposable towels) are consistently available.\n\nShips should carry a sufficient quantity ofPPE, including facemasks, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators, eye protection such as goggles or disposable face shields that cover the front and sides of the face, and disposable medical gloves and gowns.\nmedical supplies to meet day-to-day needs. Have contingency plans for rapid resupply during outbreaks.\nsterile viral transport media and sterile swabs to collect nasopharyngeal and nasal specimens if 2019-nCoV infection is suspected.\n\nThese optimal recommendations can be modified to reflect individual ship capabilities and characteristics. Cleaning and DisinfectionAt this time, in addition to routine cleaning and disinfection strategies, ships may consider more frequent cleaning of commonly touched surfaces such as handrails, countertops, and doorknobs. The primary mode of 2019-nCoV virus transmission is believed to be through respiratory droplets that are spread from an infected person through coughing or sneezing to a susceptible close contact within about 6 feet. Therefore, widespread disinfection is unlikely to be effective. Cleaning when 2019-nCoV is suspectedCleaning recommendations are based on existing CDC infection control guidance for preventing 2019-nCoV from spreading to others in homes.\n\nStandard practice for pathogens spread by air (such as measles, tuberculosis) is to restrict people unprotected (for example, no respiratory protection) from entering a vacated room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles (more information on clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions is available).\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know how long 2019-nCoV remains infectious in the air.\n\nIn the interim, it is reasonable to apply a similar time period before entering the sick person\u2019s room without respiratory protection as used for other pathogens spread by air (for example, measles, tuberculosis). Using measles as the example pdf icon[PDF \u2013 13 pages], restrict access for two hours after the sick person has left the room.\n\nClean surfaces infected by the respiratory secretions of a sick person suspected with 2019-nCoV (for example, in the sick person\u2019s living quarters or work area, and in isolation rooms).\n\nUse disinfectant products against 2019-nCoV with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved emerging viral pathogens claims. These products can be identified by the following claim:[Product name] has demonstrated effectiveness against viruses similar to 2019-nCoV on hard non-porous surfaces. Therefore, this product can be used against 2019-nCoV when used in accordance with the directions for use against [name of supporting virus] on hard, non-porous surfaces.Specific claims for \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d will not appear on the product or master label.\nMore information about EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims can be found hereexternal icon.\nIf there are no available EPA-registered products with an approved emerging viral pathogen claim for 2019-nCoV, use products with label claims against human coronaviruses according to label instructions.\n\n\nThis claim or a similar claim, will be made only through the following communications outlets: technical literature distributed exclusively to healthcare facilities, physicians, nurses, and public health officials, \u201c1-800\u201d consumer information services, social media sites and company websites (non-label related).\n\nIn addition to wearing disposable gloves during routine cleaning, wear disposable gowns when cleaning areas suspected to be contaminated by 2019-nCoV. Wear PPE compatible with the disinfectant products being used and approved for use onboard the ship. Remove carefully pdf icon[PDF \u2013 1 page] gloves and gowns to avoid cross-contamination and the surrounding area.\n\nPerform hand hygiene upon removing and disposing gloves by washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol.\n\nClean all \u201chigh-touch\u201d surfaces in the sick person\u2019s room (for example, counters, tabletops, doorknobs, light switches, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables) according to instructions described for the above EPA-registered product. Wear disposable gloves and gowns during cleaning activities.\n\nIf visible contamination (for example, blood, respiratory secretions, or other body fluids) is present, the basic principles for blood or body substance spill management are outlined in the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Bloodborne Pathogen Standardexternal icon. CDC guidelines recommend removing bulk spill matter, cleaning the site, and then disinfecting the site with the above EPA-registered disinfectant. For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes, remove visible contamination if present, and wash according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Clean and disinfect unremovable materials with products mentioned above and allow to air dry.\n\nWhen cleaning is completed, collect soiled material and PPE in a sturdy, leak-proof (plastic) bag that is tied shut and not reopened. Although not biohazardous or regulated medical waste, these materials should be incinerated and not sorted.  Porous materials that will be washed can be transported to the laundry room in the same way. Immediately clean hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer and avoid touching the face with gloved or unwashed hands.\n\nNo additional cleaning is needed for the ship\u2019s supply-and-return ventilation registers or filtration systems.\n\nNo additional treatment of wastewater is needed.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/marit...for-ships.html",
