## Work Arrangements
Totally, there are five major technical parts
+ API Development
+ MongoDB
+ Web Scraping and Data Extract
+ Google Geocode API
+ Data Analysis 

All team members are enrolled in at least one task. Most of the tasks will have two members to work on with in order to prevent single point of failure. Team members who work on MongoDB will communicate with other members to design interfaces of the database. Timeline schedule and work distribution are shown in following Grantt Chart and WBS.

## Code Management
GitHub is used for version control. In order to prevent errors and ensure there is one working version in the repository, Pull Request will be used. In this procedure, code need to be reviewed and autotested before merging into the master branch.

## Software Tools Used For Management
+ GitHub (track on coding part)
+ Messenger (Online meeting, one of our member is working from oversea)
+ Zoom (Online meeting)
