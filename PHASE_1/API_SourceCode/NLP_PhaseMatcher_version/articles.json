            "main_text": "Excellencies, distinguished guests, dear colleagues and friends,Thank you for the opportunity to address you today. \u00a0And especially my appreciation to my friend Ambassador Ischinger.Yesterday I was in Kinshasa, in the Democratic of the Congo, meeting with the President and other senior ministers to review progress against the Ebola outbreak and work together on a plan to strengthen DRC\u2019s health system so that it never sees another outbreak like this again.I\u2019d like to thank the President for his leadership, and for his vision of a healthier and safer DRC.We are finally starting to see the possibility of ending this outbreak, after more than 18 months and the loss of 2,249 lives. In the past week there has been just 1 case of Ebola, compared with 120 cases a week at the peak in April.This epidemic stands in stark contrast to the previous Ebola outbreak in the western part of DRC in 2018, an area that is relatively stable and peaceful. That outbreak was controlled in just three months.This experience illustrates a key lesson of history: disease and insecurity are old friends.It was no coincidence that the 1918 flu pandemic erupted in the middle of the First World War, and killed more people than the First World War itself.It\u2019s no coincidence that the final frontier for eradicating polio is in the most insecure regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan.It\u2019s no coincidence that Ebola has spread in the most insecure region of the DRC.Without peace, health can be an unattainable dream.But the opposite can also be true: epidemics have the potential to cause severe political, economic and social instability and insecurity.Health security is therefore not just the health sector\u2019s business. It\u2019s everybody\u2019s business.There are three main scenarios in which a coordinated response between the health and security sectors is essential:First, high-impact epidemics in situations of conflict and insecurity, such as Ebola. In the last few years, 80% of outbreaks requiring an international response have occurred in countries affected by fragility, conflict and insecurity.Second, the emergence of a pathogen with pandemic potential, moving rapidly from country to country and requiring an immediate and large-scale response in countries.And third, the deliberate or accidental release of biological agents \u2013 a hopefully rare event for which we must nonetheless be prepared.The second of these three scenarios is what we are seeing now with the outbreak of COVID-19.Although PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern) is declared, with 99% of cases in China, this is still very much an emergency for that country. Because in the rest of the world we only have 505 cases and in China we have more than 66,000 cases.Let me be clear: it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take.What I can tell you is what encourages us, and what concerns us.We are encouraged that the steps China has taken to contain the outbreak at its source appear to have bought the world time, even though those steps have come at greater cost to China itself. But it\u2019s slowing the spread to the rest of the world.We\u2019re encouraged that outside China, we have not yet seen widespread community transmission.We\u2019re encouraged that the global research community has come together to identify and accelerate the most urgent research needs for diagnostics, treatments and vaccines.We\u2019re encouraged that we have been able to ship diagnostic kits, as well as supplies of masks, gloves, gowns and other personal protective equipment to some of the countries that need it most.We\u2019re encouraged that an international team of experts is now on the ground in China, working closely with their Chinese counterparts to understand the outbreak, and to inform the next steps in the global response.But we also have concerns.We\u2019re concerned by the continued increase in the number of cases in China.We\u2019re concerned by reports from China yesterday of the number of health workers who have been infected or have died.We\u2019re concerned by the lack of urgency in funding the response from the international community.We\u2019re concerned about the severe disruption in the market for personal protective equipment, which is putting front line health workers and carers at risk.We\u2019re concerned about the levels of rumours and misinformation that are hampering the response.And most of all, we\u2019re concerned about the potential havoc this virus could wreak in countries with weaker health systems.The outbreaks of Ebola and COVID-19 underscore once again the vital importance for all countries to invest in preparedness and not panic.Two years ago, WHO and the World Bank founded the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, an independent body to assess the state of the world\u2019s readiness for a pandemic. My sister Gro Bruntland, the co-chair of the Board, is actually here.Last year the board published its first report, which concluded the world remains badly prepared.For too long, the world has operated on a cycle of panic and neglect. We throw money at an outbreak, and when it\u2019s over, we forget about it and do nothing to prevent the next one.The world spends billions of dollars preparing for a terrorist attack, but relatively little preparing for the attack of a virus, which could be far more deadly and far more damaging economically, politically and socially.This is frankly difficult to understand, and dangerously short-sighted.===Today, I have three requests for the international community.First, we must use the window of opportunity we have to intensify our preparedness.China has bought the world time. We don\u2019t know how much time.All countries must be prepared for the arrival of cases, to treat patients with dignity and compassion, to prevent onward transmission, and to protect health workers.WHO is working with manufacturers and distributors of personal protective equipment to ensure a reliable supply of the tools health workers need to do their job safely and effectively.But we\u2019re not just fighting an epidemic; we\u2019re fighting an infodemic.Fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus, and is just as dangerous.That\u2019s why we\u2019re also working with search and media companies like Facebook, Google, Pinterest, Tencent, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube and others to counter the spread of rumours and misinformation.We call on all governments, companies and news organizations to work with us to sound the appropriate level of alarm, without fanning the flames of hysteria.Second, this is not a job for health ministers alone. It takes a whole-of-government approach.But that approach must be coherent and coordinated, guided by evidence and public health priorities.In many countries, measures have been taken by one part of government without appropriate consultation with the health ministry, or consideration of the impact of these measures.Now more than ever is the time for us to let science and evidence lead policy.If we don\u2019t, we are headed down a dark path that leads nowhere but division and disharmony.And third, we must be guided by solidarity, not stigma. I repeat this: we must be guided by solidarity, not stigma.The greatest enemy we face is not the virus itself; it\u2019s the stigma that turns us against each other. We must stop stigma and hate![Applause]Much has been written and said about my praise for China.I have given credit where it\u2019s due, and I will continue to do that, as I would and I did for any country that fights an outbreak aggressively at its source to protect its own people and the people of the world, even at great cost to itself.It\u2019s easy to blame. It\u2019s easy to politicize. It\u2019s harder to tackle a problem together, and find solutions together.We will all learn lessons from this outbreak. But now is not the time for recriminations or politicization.We have a choice. Can we come together to face a common and dangerous enemy? Or will we allow fear, suspicion and irrationality to distract and divide us?In our fractured and divided world, health is one of the few areas in which international cooperation offers the opportunity for countries to work together for a common cause.This is a time for facts, not fear.This is a time for rationality, not rumours.This is a time for solidarity, not stigma.I thank you.Subscribe to the WHO newsletter \u2192",

It is also requiring businesses to post warning labels about the dangers of the Naegleria fowleri microscopic amoeba and advising patrons to maintain their heads above water.In the first case of amebic meningitis in Costa Rica this year, reported last month, a 15-year-old died after contracting the infection at a Bagaces hot spring.An analysis from the University of Costa Rica (UCR) confirmed the presence of the Naegleria fowleri microscopic amoeba, which causes primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), in the hot springs of Bagaces, Guanacaste.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ticotimes_net-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',116,'0','0']));Naegleria fowleri is \u201ccommonly found in warm freshwater (e.g. lakes, rivers, and hot springs) and soil,\u201d according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and \u201cusually infects people when contaminated water enters the body through the nose.\u201d\u201cOnce the ameba enters the nose, it travels to the brain where it causes primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), which is usually fatal,\u201d the CDC says.The infection is exceedingly rare. In the United States, \u201chundreds of millions of visits to swimming venues occur each year \u2026\u00a0result in 0-8 infections per year,\u201d according to the CDC.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ticotimes_net-box-4','ezslot_1',117,'0','0']));The 4-year-old girl marks the third case ever recorded in Costa Rica, according to the Health Ministry. The first instance, in 2014, resulted in the death of an 11-year-old U.S. citizen.You cannot get infected from swallowing water containing Naegleria, nor by person-to-person contact. The CDC says the risk of infection is \u201cvery low\u201d even when swimming in water containing Naegleria fowleri.\u201cNo method currently exists that accurately and reproducibly measures the numbers of amebae in the water,\u201d the CDC says. \u201cThis makes it unclear how a standard might be set to protect human health and how public health officials would measure and enforce such a standard.\u201dThe Health Ministry says the public can continue to visit hot springs but recommends the following:eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'ticotimes_net-banner-1','ezslot_3',127,'0','0']));President Carlos Alvarado said Costa Rica is preparing a series of economic measures to protect jobs and businesses during the\u2026Health Minister Daniel Salas issued a stern warning to Costa Rican businesses on Saturday afternoon after his agency received numerous\u2026Costa Rica has confirmed 26 cases of the novel coronavirus, the Health Ministry announced Friday afternoon.

Driven to Discover.The United States and other countries are evacuating their citizens from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan where the number of infected people on the ship has risen to 355, as the number of local COVID-19 cases continues to grow in Singapore and Japan and as Hawaiian health officials investigate a connection to a Japanese visitor.In other developments, China now has 68,500 cases involving the novel coronavirus, two more deaths were reported outside the mainland\u2014one in France and one in Taiwan\u2014and a passenger who disembarked from the Westerdam cruise ship has tested positive for the virus.An international joint mission led by the World Health Organization (WHO) arrived in China and met with their colleagues from China for the first time today. On Twitter, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said, \"We look forward to this vitally important collaboration contributing to global knowledge about the COVID19 outbreak.\"Yesterday, Japan's health ministry reported 67 new cruise ship infections (38 asymptomatic) and today the agency reported 70 new cases (38 asymptomatic), bringing the total to 355.Meanwhile, a number of countries, including the United States, are evacuating their citizens from the quarantined cruise ship, which has been in Japan's Yokohama port since Feb 3. In a statement yesterday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it was working with the State Department to bring US citizens home on charter flights. There are about 400 Americans on the ship.The returning passengers will be subject to a 14-day quarantine and will be housed at two locations: Travis Air Force Base in California and Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas. Passengers will be screened before leaving Japan to avoid symptomatic people from boarding the plane. Once they return to the United States, the passengers will be housed separately from the evacuees from Hubei province.Meanwhile, an 83-year-old American woman who was on the Westerdam cruise ship and disembarked in Cambodia has tested positive for the virus after arriving in Malaysia, Reuters reported yesterday. She is the first of the boat's passengers to test positive. Cambodia recently allowed the ship to dock after it was turned away by four other countries.The woman initially tested negative in Cambodia, then was positive in a preliminary test in Malaysia. A second test confirmed the finding, according to the report. The test results for the woman's husband were negative. The couple were the only two with symptoms among the 145 ship passengers who entered Malaysia, which has now barred other Westerdam passengers. There are still 236 passengers and 747 crew on the boat.Over the weekend, Singapore and Japan reported more cases, nearly all local, and one of Japan's cases involves a traveler who got sick after arriving home from Hawaii.In health ministry reports yesterday and today, Singapore\u2014which has the most cases outside of China\u2014reported 8 more cases, raising its total to 75. The health ministry said 5 were linked to a known church cluster, 2 were connected to known contacts, and 1 was part of an identified workplace cluster.Meanwhile, Japan reported 6 more cases yesterday, raising its total to 43. Three patients are in Wakayama prefecture and appear to be part of a hospital cluster, including the wife of a man who worked at the facility.Two of the people confirmed in Japan over the past few days are a husband and wife who recently vacationed in Japan. The Hawaii Department of Health said in a Feb 14 statement that the man, who was apparently diagnosed first, stayed for a few days in Maui then traveled to Oahu, where he experienced cold-like symptoms without fever.The health department said the man was traveling with his wife and may have worn a mask during parts of his travel and added that he wore a mask during his flight back to Japan. Hawaiian officials are tracing contacts and have alerted health providers to be alert for more cases.Over the past 3 days, the number of daily COVID-19 cases reported in China declined, with 5,090 reported Friday, 2,641 yesterday, and 2,009 today. In an update today from the National Health Commission (NHC), the country reported 291 more serious cases and 142 more deaths, raising those respective totals to 11,272 and 1,665.The World Health Organization (WHO) online COVID-19 dashboard shows that, although Hubei province is the main epicenter, four other provinces have more than 1,000 confirmed cases: Guangdong (1,316), Henan (1,231), Zhejiang (1,167), and Hunan (1,004)Hubei province's government today announced new strict measures to curb the spread of the virus, Reuters reported. Authorities have barred all cars from the roads except for police cars, ambulances, public service vehicles, and those transporting goods. Government officials also announced health checks for all residents and said that companies must receive permission before resuming work.French health officials yesterday reported a death in an 80-year-old Chinese tourist who was hospitalized in Paris, marking the first such death in Europe, according to a Reuters report,In Taiwan, health officials today reported the first death in the administrative region, one of two cases reported today, both apparently involving local transmission, according to an official statement translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary (AFD), an infectious disease news blog.

            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.The United States and other countries are evacuating their citizens from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan where the number of infected people on the ship has risen to 355, as the number of local COVID-19 cases continues to grow in Singapore and Japan and as Hawaiian health officials investigate a connection to a Japanese visitor.In other developments, China now has 68,500 cases involving the novel coronavirus, two more deaths were reported outside the mainland\u2014one in France and one in Taiwan\u2014and a passenger who disembarked from the Westerdam cruise ship has tested positive for the virus.An international joint mission led by the World Health Organization (WHO) arrived in China and met with their colleagues from China for the first time today. On Twitter, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said, \"We look forward to this vitally important collaboration contributing to global knowledge about the COVID19 outbreak.\"Yesterday, Japan's health ministry reported 67 new cruise ship infections (38 asymptomatic) and today the agency reported 70 new cases (38 asymptomatic), bringing the total to 355.Meanwhile, a number of countries, including the United States, are evacuating their citizens from the quarantined cruise ship, which has been in Japan's Yokohama port since Feb 3. In a statement yesterday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it was working with the State Department to bring US citizens home on charter flights. There are about 400 Americans on the ship.The returning passengers will be subject to a 14-day quarantine and will be housed at two locations: Travis Air Force Base in California and Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas. Passengers will be screened before leaving Japan to avoid symptomatic people from boarding the plane. Once they return to the United States, the passengers will be housed separately from the evacuees from Hubei province.Meanwhile, an 83-year-old American woman who was on the Westerdam cruise ship and disembarked in Cambodia has tested positive for the virus after arriving in Malaysia, Reuters reported yesterday. She is the first of the boat's passengers to test positive. Cambodia recently allowed the ship to dock after it was turned away by four other countries.The woman initially tested negative in Cambodia, then was positive in a preliminary test in Malaysia. A second test confirmed the finding, according to the report. The test results for the woman's husband were negative. The couple were the only two with symptoms among the 145 ship passengers who entered Malaysia, which has now barred other Westerdam passengers. There are still 236 passengers and 747 crew on the boat.Over the weekend, Singapore and Japan reported more cases, nearly all local, and one of Japan's cases involves a traveler who got sick after arriving home from Hawaii.In health ministry reports yesterday and today, Singapore\u2014which has the most cases outside of China\u2014reported 8 more cases, raising its total to 75. The health ministry said 5 were linked to a known church cluster, 2 were connected to known contacts, and 1 was part of an identified workplace cluster.Meanwhile, Japan reported 6 more cases yesterday, raising its total to 43. Three patients are in Wakayama prefecture and appear to be part of a hospital cluster, including the wife of a man who worked at the facility.Two of the people confirmed in Japan over the past few days are a husband and wife who recently vacationed in Japan. The Hawaii Department of Health said in a Feb 14 statement that the man, who was apparently diagnosed first, stayed for a few days in Maui then traveled to Oahu, where he experienced cold-like symptoms without fever.The health department said the man was traveling with his wife and may have worn a mask during parts of his travel and added that he wore a mask during his flight back to Japan. Hawaiian officials are tracing contacts and have alerted health providers to be alert for more cases.Over the past 3 days, the number of daily COVID-19 cases reported in China declined, with 5,090 reported Friday, 2,641 yesterday, and 2,009 today. In an update today from the National Health Commission (NHC), the country reported 291 more serious cases and 142 more deaths, raising those respective totals to 11,272 and 1,665.The World Health Organization (WHO) online COVID-19 dashboard shows that, although Hubei province is the main epicenter, four other provinces have more than 1,000 confirmed cases: Guangdong (1,316), Henan (1,231), Zhejiang (1,167), and Hunan (1,004)Hubei province's government today announced new strict measures to curb the spread of the virus, Reuters reported. Authorities have barred all cars from the roads except for police cars, ambulances, public service vehicles, and those transporting goods. Government officials also announced health checks for all residents and said that companies must receive permission before resuming work.French health officials yesterday reported a death in an 80-year-old Chinese tourist who was hospitalized in Paris, marking the first such death in Europe, according to a Reuters report,In Taiwan, health officials today reported the first death in the administrative region, one of two cases reported today, both apparently involving local transmission, according to an official statement translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary (AFD), an infectious disease news blog. The report said the man was in his 60s and had underlying health conditions.In other COVID-19 developments over the last few days:See also:Feb 16 Tedros tweetFeb 15 Japan health ministry cruise ship updateFeb 16 Japan health ministry cruise ship updateFeb 15 CDC press releaseFeb 15 Reuters story on Westerdam developmentFeb 15 Singapore health ministry statementFeb 16 Singapore health ministry statementFeb 15 Japanese health ministry statementFeb 14 Hawaii Department of Health statementFeb 16 China NHC daily updateFeb 16 Reuters story on Hubei province measuresWHO online COVID-19 dashboardFeb 16 Reuters story on French deathFeb 16 AFD postGet CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now\u00bbUnrestricted financial support provided byGrant support for ASP provided byBecome an underwriter\u00bbCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

            "main_text": "BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China has issued more than 1,600 force majeure certificates to shield companies from legal damages arising from the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak.The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) has issued 1,615 certificates by last Friday for companies involving over 30 sectors, covering a total contract value of 109.9 billion yuan (about 15.7 billion U.S. dollars), said the CCPIT.The certificate exonerates companies from not performing or partially performing contractual duties by proving they are suffering from circumstances beyond their control.The COVID-19 epidemic has delayed production for some companies as quarantine measures held back many workers from returning to their posts.Some firms have presented the certificate to their clients and agreed on a later date to fulfill orders without facing legal liabilities, said the CCPIT.A manufacturing company in eastern China's Zhejiang Province was the first to obtain the certificate on Feb. 2 to excuse itself from breaching a 2.4-million-yuan overseas order that could incur 30 million yuan of compensation.The CCPIT's force majeure certificates are recognized by governments, customs, trade associations and enterprises of more than 200 countries and regions, it said.To minimize losses for foreign trade companies amid the outbreak, especially from contractual breaches, the Ministry of Commerce has instructed six trade associations in sectors like textile, mining, machinery and healthcare to help with legal counseling and applying for force majeure certificates.Chinese authorities have also urged local officials to help foreign-funded companies with work resumption and operation, with eastern China's Shandong Province rolling out a raft of measures like tax relief and deferring social insurance payments.",

            "main_text": "2 Min ReadBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Growth of global trade in goods is likely to remain weak in early 2020, the World Trade Organization (WTO) said on Monday, adding that the below-trend performance could become even worse due to the new coronavirus.The Geneva-based trade body said its goods trade indicator fell to 95.5 from the 96.6 reading reported in November. Readings of less than 100 indicate trade growth below medium-term trends.The WTO said the new figure did not take into account the most recent developments, such as the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which could dampen trade prospects further.Global merchandise trade fell by 0.2% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2019, the WTO said, with a possible pick-up in the fourth quarter.However, its new data indicated this recovery would not be sustained, with a decline now looking likely in the Jan-March period of 2020.The WTO trade outlook indicator is a composite of data on export orders in business surveys, air freight, container shipping, car production and sales and trade in electronic components and agricultural materials, particularly wood.It is designed to identify turning points and gauge momentum in global trade growth rather than to provide a specific short-term forecast.Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; Editing by Alex RichardsonAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Photo: Lynn GrievesonDileepa Fonseka is a political reporter based in Wellington who covers housing, infrastructure, immigration, transport, local government and the Provincial Growth Fund.ImmigrationEfforts by the Chinese government to contain the coronavirus have an unlikely casualty: our tourist visa processing systems, Dileepa Fonseka reportsThe shutdown of\u00a0Immigration New Zealand's Beijing branch has also caused delays for\u00a0thousands of non-Chinese tourists trying to enter New Zealand.Applications from over 6000 tourists and students, some from\u00a0countries thousands of kilometres away from China, were stranded in Immigration NZ's Beijing office after it was shutdown over coronavirus\u00a0fears.The Chinese government has closed\u00a0schools and businesses all around China\u00a0as part of its attempts to manage the disease.INZ relocated many of its visitor visa processing functions to Beijing after 2017.The thinking was that centralising\u00a0visitor visa processing in a country where many of New Zealand's visitors came from would allow staff to specialise in that type of processing and\u00a0turn applications\u00a0around quicker.Newsroom was contacted by a person representing tourists who had received an email early this week informing them that their application was one of 5600 on hold at the Beijing office while a decision was made on whether they needed to be transferred out.The person was surprised because the tourists concerned came from a country that did not have a single confirmed case of coronavirus. They\u00a0also had no plans to transit through China.The tourists were granted a visa on Thursday.Applications transferred to other officesINZ closed its Visa Application processing centre in Beijing in early February.In a statement an INZ spokeswoman said the\u00a0organisation had started transferring some visitor and student applications out of Beijing in January 28 when it became clear it would not be possible to re-open the Beijing office.The spokeswoman said other applications continued to arrive at the office and would be transferred out as they did.Nicola Hogg, general manager Border and Visa operations, said in a statement on Thursday\u00a0that 6500\u00a0applications filed by non-Chinese tourists and students\u00a0had now been transferred out of Beijing and sent to INZ's\u00a0other offices including Mumbai and Porirua.Hogg said 5600 applications from mainland Chinese were still at INZ's Beijing office.\"As these individuals are unable to travel to New Zealand due to the travel restrictions currently in place, they were not among the first applications to be transferred to other offices.\"\"It is likely that there will be some impact on visa processing times as a result of the temporary closure of the Beijing office. However, INZ is working hard to try to minimise the impact on processing time as much as possible.\"Immigration New Zealand revealed more details of the impact the closure would have in an email they sent to Immigration advisers early Monday morning.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis office closure means we have 130 fewer immigration officers in the network processing predominantly student and visitor visas,\u201d they wrote.\n\u00a0\n\u201cApplications are being taken from the Beijing office queue and transferred to other offices across the network\u2026these branches include Porirua, Manila, Mumbai and Palmerston North.\u201dSupporting calm, considered journalism has never been so important.Already in 2020 the value of public interest journalism, shorn of hype and hysteria, has become acutely evident.

            "main_text": "The Public Health Agency of Canada says it will review its protocols for health-care workers after nurses\u2019 unions denounced the national guidelines set out for dealing with the novel coronavirus earlier this monthThe agency says feedback from the nurses\u2019 unions and other associations will be considered by a national advisory committee on infection prevention and control as it looks to update the guidance.The protocols set out how health workers should protect themselves and their patients if they encounter a potential case of the new coronavirus, or COVID-19, including the kind of protective equipment they should use.READ MORE: \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWhat are coronavirus symptoms? In mild cases, just like the common coldThe Canadian Federation of Nurses\u2019 Unions wrote to Health Minister Patty Hajdu last week to tell her the guidelines are unacceptable since they assume the virus cannot spread easily through the air, only through larger droplets from coughing or sneezing.In a statement Monday, the federal public-health agency says the guidelines were approved by a special advisory committee of federal and provincial representatives.\u201cProtecting health care workers and patients from exposure to the novel coronavirus is our priority,\u201d an agency spokesperson wrote Monday. \u201cWe will continue to engage with stakeholders and apply evidence and expert advice in updating guidance.\u201dThough Canada\u2019s current federal guidelines are in line with World Health Organization recommendations, both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States and its European counterpart call for added precautions to protect against the possibility the disease is airborne.Provinces can also set their own standards and protocols to protect workers from possible exposure to the virus. Ontario has already called for its workers to wear respirators when dealing with potential cases of COVID-19, rather than surgical masks as the federal agency suggests.So far, only eight cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in Canada, but public health authorities agree they must be prepared for that to change.READ MORE: \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tVancouver\u2019s Chinese-Canadian businesses report up to 70% business drop amid virus fearsThe health agency says it\u2019s trying to chase down some people who left a cruise ship in Cambodia, the MS Westerdam, before one of their fellow passengers tested positive for the illness.\u201cCanadian passengers from the MS Westerdam were identified so that they would be screened upon arrival at a port of entry into Canada,\u201d it said in a written statement Monday.They\u2019ll be given information about COVID-19 and asked to isolate themselves for two weeks, the agency said, and to fill out a form so their local public-health authorities can contact them.But those screens went up too late for some of the hundreds of Canadians who were aboard the Holland America ship.\u201cSome travellers returned before these measures were put in place. The Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency are working together to identify those individuals who will be contacted by PHAC officials,\u201d the agency\u2019s statement said.Canada is also preparing for another wave of evacuees with possible exposure to the virus, though health authorities say their risk of infection is low.READ MORE: \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCOVID-19: Ontario couple on quarantined Diamond Princess say days are \u2018long and boring\u2019Hundreds of Canadians who have spent almost two weeks in isolation on a second cruise ship, the Diamond Princess docked in Yokohama, Japan, will be flown home to Canada to spend another two weeks of quarantine in Cornwall, Ont.The Diamond Princess has had more than 450 cases confirmed on board so far.During their repatriation the Diamond Princess passengers will follow the same rules as the Canadians and their families who recently returned from Wuhan, China, the centre of the outbreak.Some in Cornwall, including the town\u2019s mayor Bernadette Clement, have expressed reservations about hosting a large population of people who may have been exposed to the virus. They will be housed in an isolated section of the Nav Centre, a training centre with attached hotel and conference facility.Health officials have assured people in the area the risk of those repatriated Canadians having the illness when they arrive in Canada is low, and they are taking precautions.\u201cWe are satisfied that the infection control precautions and quarantine procedures will meet the needs of the quarantined individuals while also keeping the public safe,\u201d the Eastern Ontario Health Unit\u2019s medical officer of health, Dr. Paul Roumeliotis, said in a statement Monday.Get a roundup of the most important and intriguing national stories delivered to your inbox every weekday.Want to discuss?

            "main_text": "Chinese Canadians are bearing the brunt of misinformation and rumour about COVID-19, warns Canada\u2019s health minister.Patty Hajdu met with her B.C. counterpart Adrian Dix, Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart and stakeholders in the Vancouver Chinese Canadian community Monday to find ways to combat the issue.Alex Wang, who runs the Peninsula Seafood Restaurant in Oakridge said he\u2019s seen business drop more than 70 per cent.\u201cFor my cash flow, I don\u2019t think I can survive longer than three months,\u201d he said.Wang said he\u2019s trying to avoid laying off staff, some who\u2019ve been with the business for six years, but has been forced to cut shifts.\u201cThe biggest loss is the salary and our inventory that we prepare for the Chinese New Year.\u201dREAD MORE:\u00a0Ministers, mayor push back against coronavirus stigma in Toronto\u2019s Chinatown neighbourhoodMayor Stewart said Wang\u2019s concerns are widespread in the community, where unfounded fears around COVID-19 have some entrepreneurs worried they\u2019ll be put out of business.\u201cWe\u2019ve heard some restaurants that are losing 50, 60, 70 per cent of business which is very, very concerning to us, because most of it is based on misinformation,\u201d said Stewart.\u201cWe\u2019re encouraging people to go on with their regular business, enjoy all the great food and other services that are offered here in Chinatown and other Chinese communities because at this stage we\u2019re considering everything safe and we don\u2019t want these businesses hurt.\u201dAs the COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow, there has been rising concern about racism and misinformation which is rapidly being spread online.Asian supermarket chain T&T was forced to issue a statement in January after social media posts linked it to the virus, while this month a B.C. man who had never been infected found himself as the unwitting face of the disease thanks to a viral photo.Hajdu made a similar stop with Ontario\u2019s health minister and Toronto\u2019s mayor last week amid similar concerns stigmatization in that city\u2019s Chinatown.READ MORE: \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAs coronavirus dominates headlines, xenophobic and insensitive social media posts go viralHajdu said there was nothing new about online misinformation, but that the speed with which it\u2019s spreading is a challenge.\u201cSometimes there are alternative agendas for misinformation,\u201d she said.\u201cSometimes people drive fear because they like to, sometimes they drive fear because it might result in a profit. You can sell more masks for example if you create more fear. People sometimes drive fear as a way to cast aspersions on communities.\u201dHajdu said it is more important than ever that Canadians stick to reliable sources of information, whether it be credible media or official provincial or federal public health officials.Dix said health officials in British Columbia had made a point of maximum transparency, including weekly in-person updates with the province\u2019s top doctor, in a bid to counter misinformation.\u201cWe are determined, any time there is a positive case, to let people know and we\u2019ve consistently done that,\u201d he said.\u201cPeople can be assured that that is going to happen every single time.\u201dREAD MORE:\u00a0Chinese Canadians warn public against spreading fear, racism over coronavirusHajdu also spoke about Canadians aboard cruise ships docked in Cambodia and Yokohama where COVID-19 cases have surfaced.She said there was no formal timeline to repatriate Canadians aboard the ship in Japan, but that officials anticipate it could take place later this week.She added that health officials were still working to determine which Canadians aboard the ship in Cambodia had left that ship and what their travel routes were.As of Monday, eight COVID-19 cases had been identified in Canada \u2014 five in British Columbia and three in Ontario.The virus has killed more than 1,700 people and infected more than 70,000 people in total, most of them in mainland China.Get a roundup of the most important and intriguing national stories delivered to your inbox every weekday.Want to discuss?

            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.Over the weekend and through today, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health (MOH) reported two MERS-CoV cases, bringing the total number of cases detected in February so far to eight.The first new MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) case involves a 72-year-old man from Wadi ad-Dawasir. The man's contact with camel was unknown, and he was not a healthcare worker. He is listed as a primary case, meaning it is unlikely he contracted the virus from another person.The second case, noted today, occurred in a 40-year-old man from Najran. His case is also listed as primary, and his camel contact status is unknown.Saudi Arabia reported 15 cases in January, including a probable healthcare-related cluster of 6 cases in Abha.The World Health Organization (WHO) said in its latest monthly update that, since 2012, it has received reports of 2,499 MERS-CoV cases, at least 861 of them fatal. The vast majority of these cases were in Saudi Arabia.Feb 15 Saudi MOH report Feb 17 Saudi MOH reportThe Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Burundi, Ghana, and Zambia have licensed Merck's Ervebo\u2014the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine\u2014according to the WHO.The move allows Merck to stockpile the vaccine and distribute it to countries most at risk of Ebola virus disease outbreaks. Once licensed, the vaccine can be used outside of research protocols and clinical trials.\"The approval of the Ebola vaccine by these countries is another milestone in the fight against this unforgiving disease,\" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, in a news release. \"Africa has rallied to cement hard-fought progress to keep its people safe from Ebola.\"Ervebo has been used on almost 300,000 people in the DRC since August 2018, when the country's current Ebola outbreak began. Preliminary studies suggest the vaccine is 97.5% effective in preventing Ebola transmission.According to the WHO's online Ebola dashboard there have been 3,432 Ebola cases confirmed in the current outbreak, including 2,249 deaths. Feb 14 WHO news release  WHO Ebola dashboardVietnamese officials confirmed six H5N6 avian flu outbreaks in the northern part of the country, including five in Thanh Hoa province and one in Nghe An province, according to a World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) report today.The outbreaks in Thanh Hoa affected village and backyard flocks ranging in size from 970 to 3,167 poultry, while the one in Nghe An involves a village flock of 161 birds. The outbreaks began on Feb 12 through Feb 14.All told, the virus affected 3,200 poultry, killing 1,750 of them, among 8,087 susceptible birds.

            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.A major reduction in the use of fluoroquinolones has driven a 12% decrease in total antibiotic use in Canadian hospitals in recent years, according to a new study in Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control.In the retrospective surveillance study, acute care hospitals participating in the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP) submitted annual data on all systemic antimicrobial use (AMU) from 2009 to 2016. National and regional rates of AMU were calculated and analyzed using defined daily doses per 1,000 patient-days (DDD/1,000 pd), and AMU data were used to rank the top antimicrobial agents used individually, by class/subclass, and by year. Overall, 16 to 18 CNISP adult hospitals per year provided data, with representation from 6 sites in western Canada, 15 in central Canada, and 1 in eastern Canada.From 2009 to 2016, the data showed a 12% reduction in total AMU (from 654 to 573 DDD/1,000 pd,\u00a0P\u2009=\u20090.03). Fluoroquinolones accounted for most of this decrease, with a 47% reduction in combined oral and intravenous use, (from 129 to 68 DDD/1,000 pd,\u00a0P\u2009<\u20090.002). The top five antimicrobials used in 2016 were cefazolin (78 DDD/1,000 pd), piperacillin-tazobactam (53 DDD/1,000 pd), ceftriaxone (49 DDD/1,000 pd), vancomycin (combined oral and intravenous use: 44 DDD/1,000 pd), and ciprofloxacin (combined oral and intravenous use: 42 DDD/1,000 pd).Among the top 10 antimicrobials used in 2016, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole use decreased significantly between 2009 and 2016, by 46% (P\u2009=\u00a00.002) and 26% (P\u2009=\u20090.002) respectively. Use of ceftriaxone (85% increase,\u00a0P\u2009=\u20090.0008) and oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (140% increase,\u00a0P\u2009<\u20090.0001) increased significantly but contributed only a small component (8.6% and 5.0%, respectively) of overall use.The authors of the study say it's unclear whether the reduction in fluoroquinolone use is related to stewardship efforts, warnings of adverse effects associated with fluoroquinolone use in the United States and Canada, or a combination.Feb 13 Antimicrob Resist Infect Control studyA systematic review of 11 studies indicates that the use of electronic alerts for diagnostic stewardship for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) was associated with reductions in CDI testing, inappropriate CDI testing, and rates of CDI, researchers reported in Clinical Infectious Diseases.The aim of the study was to determine whether CDI testing-oriented electronic alerts, which aim to discourage inappropriate testing and subsequent unnecessary antibiotic treatment, have an effect not just on process indicators, such as laboratory ordering, but also on intermediate outcomes (rates of CDI testing and inappropriate testing) and patient-centered outcomes (rates of CDI).\u00a0 To answer those questions, the researchers searched six databases for studies evaluating the association between the alerts and CDI testing volume and/or CDI rate.The 11 studies that met the criteria for inclusion varied significantly in alert triggers and study outcomes. Nine studies used an alert discouraging CDI testing when the patient had recent laxative use, 7 used an alert discouraging CDI testing with lack of clinical indication for testing, and 6 used an alert discouraging CDI testing when the patient had recent CDI testing; 11 articles studied the number of tests ordered, 6 studied the number of appropriate tests, and 7 studied the CDI rate.Six of the 11 studies demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in CDI testing volume, 6 of 6 studies evaluating appropriateness of CDI testing found a significant reduction in the proportion of inappropriate testing, and 4 of 7 studies measuring CDI rate demonstrated a significant decrease in the CDI rate in the post- vs pre-intervention periods. The magnitude of the increase in appropriate CDI testing varied, with some studies reporting an increase with minimal clinical significance.The authors of the review note that, while alert-based interventions appeared to be largely successful in achieving the desired changes, most studies included multiple co-interventions, and none were randomized. In addition, they point out that unintended adverse consequences, such as underdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of CDI, and alert fatigue\u2014in which physicians have trouble distinguishing between clinically meaningful and non-meaningful alerts\u2014remain understudied.Feb 15 Clin Infect Dis abstractGet CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now\u00bbUnrestricted financial support provided byGrant support for ASP provided byBecome an underwriter\u00bbCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.As cases passed the 70,000 mark today, China published a detailed picture of its COVID-19 outbreak, which now shows signs of declining; however, officials warned cases could rebound as people return to work and school after the extended Lunar New Year break.In other developments, the number of infected people on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan continued to soar, as infections were detected in 14 Americans who were just evacuated from the ship.China's report on the outbreak's epidemiologic patterns covers all COVID-19 cases reported through Feb 11 and appears in the China CDC Weekly, a publication that is similar to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.The team analyzed more than 72,000 patient records, of which 44,672 were lab-confirmed cases, 16,186 suspected cases, 10,567 clinically diagnosed cases, and 889 asymptomatic cases. Of the confirmed cases, 80.9% cases were mild, and the vast majority (86.6%) of confirmed cases were in people ages 30 to 79 years old.About 14% of the illnesses were severe, which included pneumonia and shortness of breath, and about 5% have critical disease, marked by respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. The overall case fatality rate was 2.3%, and of 1,023 deaths included in the study, the majority were in people age 60 and older or those with underlying medical conditions.Epidemiologic curve analysis shows a common source pattern in December, which shifted to a propagated source pattern starting in early January, which the researchers said might reflect several zoonotic events at the outbreak market in Wuhan. Around Jan 23 to Jan 26, the epidemic peaked and began to decline, according to the data.Though 1,716 healthcare workers were infected in the outbreak, 5 of them fatally, there is no evidence of super-spreader events in healthcare facilities caring for COVID-19 cases, the group wrote. Those events were hallmarks of outbreaks involving severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). So far, it's not clear if the difference is due to the virus or prevention tactics, they noted.China's massive control measures, which started on Jan 23 with limiting travel in and out of Wuhan, slowed China's epidemic and its spread to the rest of the world, the authors note. But they warn that officials need to prepare for the epidemic to rebound when huge numbers of people in China return to work and school.At a media telebriefing today, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said the new data from China gives health officials a better understanding about the affected age range, the severity of the disease, and the mortality rate, which he said helps the WHO deliver evidence-based guidance to countries.However, he said the report's indication of a decline in cases should be interpreted with caution. \"Trends can change as new populations are affected,\" he said. \"It's too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table.\"Tedros said relatively few cases have been reported in children, but more research is needed to understand why. Though the new report fills in some gaps for understanding the outbreak, others remain. He added that the international expert team is now on the ground in China to answer more questions and to get an even clearer picture of the outbreak.China's National Health Commission today reported 2,048 new cases, a slight increase from the 2,009 it reported yesterday. It also reported 628 fewer severe cases as it adjusts those totals and 105 more deaths. The country's totals now stand at 70,548 cases, 10,644 severe cases, and 1,770 deaths.Japan's health ministry today reported that 99 more people on the Diamond Princess cruise ship have tested positive, raising the total to 454. The ship has been quarantined in Yokohama port since Feb 3.Meanwhile, the US State Department said it evacuated more than 300 US citizens and their family members who had been on the Diamond Princess, and all were evaluated by medical officials from the Department of Health and Human Services and deemed asymptomatic and fit to fly.However, between getting off the ship and heading for the airport in Japan, US officials learned that 14 passengers who had been tested 2 or 3 days earlier were positive for COVID-19. They were moved to a specialized part of the aircraft and isolated according to standard protocol.The whole group flew back to the United States, with passengers slated to arrive at either Travis Air Force Base in California or Joint Base San Antonio in Texas.In other developments in Japan, the country's health ministry reported two more local cases, one involving a health ministry official who worked as a liaison on the Diamond Princess and the other a nurse who worked at a hospital near Tokyo, where she took care of a woman in her 80s who died from the disease, Kyodo News reported today.Singapore's health ministry today reported 2 more cases, raising its total to 77. The patients include an individual who was evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9 and a person who is a contact of an earlier case.The United Arab Emirates (UAE) health ministry yesterday reported 1 more COVID-19 case, which involves a 37-year-old Chinese man. The infection brings the UAE's total to 9, of whom 3 have recovered and 6 are still receiving treatment, 1 of them in an intensive care unit.In a preprint publication yesterday, an international group of virologists detailed the evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is not lab made or artificially manipulated.Based on their analysis of the genome, they described its notable features and scenarios that likely led to its evolution. They proposed two scenarios: natural selection in a host animal before the virus jumped to humans, or natural selection in humans following transmission from animals to people.They also looked at whether selection during passage in culture could have produced the same genetic features they observed.Get CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now\u00bbUnrestricted financial support provided byGrant support for ASP provided byBecome an underwriter\u00bbCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

            "main_text": "In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care. Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.The authors have declared no competing interest.NoneAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Read the update here.Global Affairs Canada says it is aware of at least 32 Canadians who have tested positive for the new coronavirus on board the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship that has been quarantined in Japan since early February.\u201cThere are 256 Canadians on the Diamond Princess cruise ship,\u201d Global Affairs said in a statement emailed to Global News Monday night.\u201cOf that number, we are aware of 32 Canadians that have tested positive for the COVID-19.\u201dREAD MORE: \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMore than 80% of COVID-19 cases have been mild, says new Chinese health reportThis statement came two days after the government announced it was chartering a plane to evacuate the Canadians on board the ship, a decision it said it took \u201cbecause of the extraordinary circumstances faced by passengers on the Diamond Princess and to lighten the burden on the Japanese health-care system.\u201dPrevious reports placed the number of Canadians who tested positive for COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess at 15, and that they would remain in Japan for medical treatment.READ MORE: \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCOVID-19: Ontario couple on quarantined Diamond Princess say days are \u2018long and boring\u2019More than 450 people on the ship \u2014 which has some 3,700 passengers on board \u2014 have tested positive for the virus, according to Japanese health officials, with 99 of those cases reported Monday.In total, including the 454 from the Diamond Princess, Japan has 520 confirmed cases of the virus, as of Monday, according to Reuters. The ship is the site of the highest number of COVID-19 cases outside of China.The cruise ship\u00a0was ordered to stay under quarantine at Yokohama port on Feb. 3, after an 80-year-old Hong Kong man, who was on board from Jan. 20 to Jan. 25, developed the virus.Two charter planes carrying American passengers of the cruise ship landed at military bases in Texas and California over the weekend, sparking another 14-day quarantine for those on board.The U.S. State Department later reported that 14 of the evacuees received confirmed they had the virus but were allowed to board the flight because they did not have symptoms. They were being isolated separately from other passengers on the flight, the U.S. State and Health and Human Services said in a joint statement.READ MORE: \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t14 Americans evacuated from Japan cruise ship test positive for coronavirusCanadians on the Diamond Princess are expected to undergo screening for symptoms in Japan before boarding the charter plane. Details of when the plane will fly there and return with the Canadians from the cruise are scarce.A spokesperson for Global Affairs said Canada is working with Princess Cruises and the government of Japan \u201cto assist in this evacuation\u201d and that a departure date \u201cwill be confirmed once final arrangements will be confirmed with the Japanese government and the cruise ship company.\u201dThe latest statement by Global Affairs re-affirmed that the charter plane will fly Canadians evacuees to the Canadian Forces Base in Trenton, Ont., where they will be assessed. They will then be taken to NAC Canada Training Institute in Cornwall, Ont., for a 14-day quarantine.Anyone showing symptoms of the virus before boarding the plane in Japan will not be allowed on board and will be diverted to the health-care system in Japan instead.\u201cCurrently 4 members of the Standing Rapid Deployment Team (SRDT), 3 experts from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and 7 Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) medical personnel are being deployed to Japan to support the evacuation,\u201d Global Affairs said in the statement.Both citizens and permanent residents of Canada are eligible for the charter flight.\u201cNon-Canadian immediate family members of Canadian citizens and permanent residents (space permitting) will also be accommodated in order to avoid separating families,\u201d the statement said.READ MORE: \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCOVID-19: Edmonton couple on quarantined Diamond Princess wait for plane to evacuate CanadiansAny Canadians choosing to not take the charter flight will have to complete the current quarantine in Japan.Health Minister Patty Hajdu told reporters Monday that the government is still working on determining how many Canadians want evacuation from the cruise ship, with approximately 100 of the 256 on board not yet signalling they wanted to return to Canada.She said they expect the flight to leave later this week but was unable to provide exact details yet.\u201cI know there\u2019s about 100 Canadians or so out of the 250-plus that have not responded yet in terms of what their intentions are,\u201d she said.\u2014 With files by The Canadian Press, The Associated Press, ReutersGet a roundup of the most important and intriguing national stories delivered to your inbox every weekday.Want to discuss?

School district officials say 7-year-old Matthew Wzorek died Sunday.He was a student at Worrell Elementary School in Broomall.\u201cMatthew was known to have a happy smile and kind heart in class. He loved being with his friends and was always willing to offer assistances to his teachers and peers. To say he will be missed is an enormous understatement,\u201d the Marple Newtown School District said in a letter to parents.In another letter to the community Monday night, district official say \u201cthe entire district should be on high alert for signs and symptoms of the flu.\u201d\u201cIn all likelihood, all of the students in this 2nd grade classroom have been exposed to the influenza B virus,\u201d the statement reads.They also say Matthew\u2019s teacher has the flu and will be out of school for the rest of the week.According to the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, the flu is circulating widely in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.Officials say there are ways you can protect yourself, like getting a flu shot.The flu circulates until March or April every year, so there is still time to get vaccinated.Officials are also advising you to stay away from people who may be sick and to wash your hands often with soap and warm water.Also, avoid touching your face.CBS3\u2019s Kimberly Davis contributed to this report.",

Andersen\nDepartment of Immunology and Microbiology,\nThe Scripps Research Institute,\nLa Jolla, CA 92037,\nUSA.Since the first reports of a novel pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China there has been considerable discussion and uncertainty over the origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 are now widespread in China, with cases in every province. As of 14 February 2020, 64,473 such cases have been confirmed, with 1,384 deaths attributed to the virus. These official case numbers are likely an underestimate because of limited reporting of mild and asymptomatic cases, and the virus is clearly capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. Based on the possibility of spread to countries with weaker healthcare systems, the World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). There are currently neither vaccines nor specific treatments for this disease.SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the  Coronaviridae  known to infect humans. Three of these viruses, SARS CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, can cause severe disease; four, HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E, are associated with mild respiratory symptoms. Herein, we review what can be deduced about the origin and early evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from the comparative analysis of available genome sequence data. In particular, we offer a perspective on the notable features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and discuss scenarios by which these features could have arisen. Importantly, this analysis provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct nor a purposefully manipulated virus.The genomic comparison of both alpha- and betacoronaviruses (family  Coronaviridae ) described below identifies two notable features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (i) based on structural modelling and early biochemical experiments, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be optimized for binding to the human ACE2 receptor; (ii) the highly variable spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1 and S2 boundary via the insertion of twelve nucleotides. Additionally, this event led to the acquisition of three predicted O-linked glycans around the polybasic cleavage site.The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses is the most variable part of the virus genome. Six residues in the RBD appear to be critical for binding to the human ACE2 receptor and determining host range1. Using coordinates based on the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV, they are Y442, L472, N479, D480, T487, and Y4911. The corresponding residues in SARS-CoV-2 are L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501, and Y505. Five of these six residues are mutated in SARS-CoV-2 compared to its most closely related virus, RaTG13 sampled from a  Rhinolophus affinis  bat, to which it is ~96% identical2 (Figure 1a). Based on modeling1 and biochemical experiments3,4, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have an RBD that may bind with high affinity to ACE2 from human, non-human primate, ferret, pig, and cat, as well as other species with high receptor homology1. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 may bind less efficiently to ACE2 in other species associated with SARS-like viruses, including rodents and civets1.The phenylalanine (F) at residue 486 in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein corresponds to L472 in the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. Notably, in SARS-CoV cell culture experiments the L472 mutates to phenylalanine (L472F)5, which is predicted to be optimal for binding of the SARS-CoV RBD to the human ACE2 receptor6. However, a phenylalanine in this position is also present in several SARS-like CoVs from bats (Figure 1a). While these analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of binding the human ACE2 receptor with high affinity, the interaction is not predicted to be optimal1. Additionally, several of the key residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 are different to those previously described as optimal for human ACE2 receptor binding6. In contrast to these computational predictions, recent binding studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 binds with high affinity to human ACE27. Thus the SARS-CoV-2 spike appears to be the result of selection on human or human-like ACE2 permitting another optimal binding solution to arise. This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is  not  the product of genetic engineering.The second notable feature of SARS-CoV-2 is a predicted polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2, the two subunits of the spike protein (Figure 1b)8,9. In addition to two basic arginines and an alanine at the cleavage site, a leading proline is also inserted; thus, the fully inserted sequence is PRRA (Figure 1b). The strong turn created by the proline insertion is predicted to result in the addition of O-linked glycans to S673, T678, and S686 that flank the polybasic cleavage site. A polybasic cleavage site has not previously been observed in related lineage B betacoronaviruses and is a unique feature of SARS-CoV-2. Some human betacoronaviruses, including HCoV-HKU1 (lineage A), have polybasic cleavage sites, as well as predicted O-linked glycans near the S1/S2 cleavage site.While the functional consequence of the polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, experiments with SARS-CoV have shown that engineering such a site at the S1/S2 junction enhances cell\u2013cell fusion but does not affect virus entry10. Polybasic cleavage sites allow effective cleavage by furin and other proteases, and can be acquired at the junction of the two subunits of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of avian influenza viruses in conditions that select for rapid virus replication and transmission (e.g. highly dense chicken populations). HA serves a similar function in cell-cell fusion and viral entry as the coronavirus S protein. Acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site in HA, by either insertion or recombination, converts low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses into highly pathogenic forms11-13. The acquisition of polybasic cleavage sites by the influenza virus HA has also been observed after repeated forced passage in cell culture or through animals14,15. Similarly, an avirulent isolate of Newcastle Disease virus became highly pathogenic during serial passage in chickens by incremental acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site at the junction of its fusion protein subunits16. The potential function of the three predicted O-linked glycans is less clear, but they could create a \u201cmucin-like domain\u201d that would shield potential epitopes or key residues on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Biochemical analyses or structural studies are required to determine whether or not the predicted O-linked glycan sites are utilized.figure2718\u00d71487 394 KBFigure 1. (a) Mutations in contact residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (top) was aligned against the most closely related SARS-like CoVs and SARS-CoV-1. Key residues in the spike protein that make contact to the ACE2 receptor are marked with blue boxes in both SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. ( b) Acquisition of polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans.  The polybasic cleavage site is marked in grey with the three adjacent predicted O-linked glycans in blue. Both the polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and not previously seen in lineage B betacoronaviruses. Sequences shown are from NCBI GenBank, accession numbers MN908947, MN996532, AY278741, KY417146, MK211376. The pangolin coronavirus sequences are a consensus generated from SRR10168377 and SRR10168378 (NCBI BioProject PRJNA573298)18,19.It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of an existing SARS-related coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for human ACE2 receptor binding with an efficient binding solution different to that which would have been predicted. Further, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one would expect that one of the several reverse genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would have been used. However, this is not the case as the genetic data shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone17. Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in a non-human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage in culture could have given rise to the same observed features.Selection in an animal host. As many of the early cases of COVID-19 were linked to the Huanan seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, it is possible that an animal source was present at this location. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, particularly RaTG13, it is plausible that bats serve as reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2. It is important, however, to note that previous outbreaks of betacoronaviruses in humans involved direct exposure to animals other than bats, including civets (SARS) and camels (MERS), that carry viruses that are genetically very similar to SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, respectively. By analogy, viruses closely related to SARS-Cov-2 may be circulating in one or more animal species. Initial analyses indicate that Malayan pangolins ( Manis javanica ) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain a CoV that is similar to SARS-CoV-218,19. Although the bat virus RaTG13 remains the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 across the whole genome, the Malayan pangolin CoV is identical to SARS-CoV-2 at all six key RBD residues (Figure 1). However, no pangolin CoV has yet been identified that is sufficiently similar to SARS-CoV-2 across its entire genome to support direct human infection. In addition, the pangolin CoV does not carry a polybasic cleavage site insertion. For a precursor virus to acquire the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the spike protein suitable for human ACE2 receptor binding, an animal host would likely have to have a high population density \u2013 to allow natural selection to proceed efficiently \u2013 and an ACE2 gene that is similar to the human orthologue. Further characterization of CoVs in pangolins and other animals that may harbour SARS-CoV-like viruses should be a public health priority.Cryptic adaptation to humans. It is also possible that a progenitor to SARS-CoV-2 jumped from a non-human animal to humans, with the genomic features described above acquired through adaptation during subsequent human-to-human transmission. We surmise that once these adaptations were acquired (either together or in series) it would enable the outbreak to take-off, producing a sufficiently large and unusual cluster of pneumonia cases to trigger the surveillance system that ultimately detected it.All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced so far have the well adapted RBD and the polybasic cleavage site, and are thus derived from a common ancestor that had these features. The presence of an RBD in pangolins that is very similar to the one in SARS-CoV-2 means that this was likely already present in the virus that jumped to humans, even if we don\u2019t yet have the exact non-human progenitor virus. This leaves the polybasic cleavage site insertion to occur during human-to-human transmission. Following the example of the influenza A virus HA gene, a specific insertion or recombination event is required to enable the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as an epidemic pathogen.Estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 using currently available genome sequence data point to virus emergence in late November to early December 201920,21, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases22. Hence, this scenario presumes a period of unrecognised transmission in humans between the initial zoonotic transfer event and the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site. Sufficient opportunity could occur if there had been many prior zoonotic events producing short chains of human-to-human transmission (so-called \u2018stuttering chains\u2019) over an extended period. This is essentially the situation for MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula where all the human cases are the result of repeated jumps of the virus from dromedary camels, producing single infections or short chains of transmission that eventually resolve. To date, after 2,499 cases over 8 years, no human adaptation has emerged that has allowed MERS-CoV to take hold in the human population.How could we test whether cryptic spread of SARS-CoV-2 enabled human adaptation?  Metagenomic studies of banked serum samples could provide important information, but given the relatively short period of viremia it may be impossible to detect low level SARS-CoV-2 circulation in historical samples. Retrospective serological studies potentially could be informative and a few such studies have already been conducted. One found that animal importation traders had a 13% seropositivity to coronaviruses23, while another noted that 3% residents of a village in Southern China were seropositive to these viruses24. Interestingly, 200 residents of Wuhan did not show coronavirus seroreactivity. Critically, however, these studies could not have distinguished whether positive serological responses were due to a prior infection with SARS-CoV-1 or -2. Further retrospective serological studies should be conducted to determine the extent of prior human exposure to betacoronaviruses in different geographic areas, particularly using assays that can distinguish among multiple betacoronaviruses.Selection during passage. Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models have been ongoing in BSL-2 for many years in multiple laboratories across the world25-28. There are also documented instances of the laboratory acquisition of SARS-CoV-1 by laboratory personnel working under BSL-2 containment29,30. We must therefore consider the possibility of a deliberate or inadvertent release of SARS-CoV-2. In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired the observed RBD mutations site during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in studies with SARS-CoV5 as well as MERS-CoV31. However, the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site or O-linked glycans - if functional - argues against this scenario. New polybasic cleavage sites have only been observed after prolonged passaging of low pathogenicity avian influenza virus in cell culture or animals. Furthermore, the generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with a very high genetic similarity. Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required an intense program of passage in cell culture or animals with ACE-2 receptor similar to humans (e.g. ferrets). It is also questionable whether generation of the O-linked glycans would have occurred on cell culture passage, as such mutations typically suggest the involvement of an immune system, that is not present  in vitro .In the midst of the global COVID-19 public health emergency it is reasonable to wonder why the origins of the epidemic matter. A detailed understanding of how an animal virus jumped species boundaries to infect humans so productively will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events. For example, if SARS-CoV-2 pre-adapted in another animal species then we are at risk of future re-emergence events even if the current epidemic is controlled. In contrast, if the adaptive process we describe occurred in humans, then even if we have repeated zoonotic transfers they are unlikely to take-off unless the same series of mutations occurs. In addition, identifying the closest animal relatives of SARS-CoV-2 will greatly assist studies of virus function. Indeed, the availability of the RaTG13 bat sequence facilitated the comparative genomic analysis performed here, helping to reveal the key mutations in the RBD as well as the polybasic cleavage site insertion.The genomic features described here may in part explain the infectiousness and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Although genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here, and it is unclear whether future data will help resolve this issue. Identifying the immediate non-human animal source and obtaining virus sequences from it would be the most definitive way of revealing virus origins. In addition, it would be helpful to obtain more genetic and functional data about the virus, including experimental studies of receptor binding and the role of the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans. The identification of a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the sequencing of very early cases including those not connected to the Wuhan market, would similarly be highly informative. Irrespective of how SARS-CoV-2 originated, the ongoing surveillance of pneumonia in humans and other animals is clearly of utmost importance.We thank all those who have contributed SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and contributed analyses and ideas to Virological.org (http://virological.org/).

I would add, however, that even if two virus isolates have an IDENTICAL amino acid sequence, that would not automatically make one the origin of the other. In my post 10 days ago, Tackling Rumors of a Suspicious Origin of nCoV2019 , I showed that mutations in the 3rd wobble base in an otherwise conserved region accumulate as to make seemingly identical viruses very much separated in time \u2013 indeed over decades.It is time to leave playing \u201cwho\u2019s ur daddy\u201d to daytime television. No known viral RNA sequence is the daddy of SARS-CoV-2. No match. If it doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit. It is all bat guano. Whatever analogy you like. A thrust of distrust and recrimination is not the path to protecting the planet from a viral catastrophe.Bill GallaherMandarin translation thanks to CHEN Guo from the Center for Infection and Immunity in the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health.The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2_ChineseSummary.pdf (198.5 KB)Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled",

Andersen\nDepartment of Immunology and Microbiology,\nThe Scripps Research Institute,\nLa Jolla, CA 92037,\nUSA.Since the first reports of a novel pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China there has been considerable discussion and uncertainty over the origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 are now widespread in China, with cases in every province. As of 14 February 2020, 64,473 such cases have been confirmed, with 1,384 deaths attributed to the virus. These official case numbers are likely an underestimate because of limited reporting of mild and asymptomatic cases, and the virus is clearly capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. Based on the possibility of spread to countries with weaker healthcare systems, the World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). There are currently neither vaccines nor specific treatments for this disease.SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the  Coronaviridae  known to infect humans. Three of these viruses, SARS CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, can cause severe disease; four, HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E, are associated with mild respiratory symptoms. Herein, we review what can be deduced about the origin and early evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from the comparative analysis of available genome sequence data. In particular, we offer a perspective on the notable features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and discuss scenarios by which these features could have arisen. Importantly, this analysis provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct nor a purposefully manipulated virus.The genomic comparison of both alpha- and betacoronaviruses (family  Coronaviridae ) described below identifies two notable features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (i) based on structural modelling and early biochemical experiments, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be optimized for binding to the human ACE2 receptor; (ii) the highly variable spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1 and S2 boundary via the insertion of twelve nucleotides. Additionally, this event led to the acquisition of three predicted O-linked glycans around the polybasic cleavage site.The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses is the most variable part of the virus genome. Six residues in the RBD appear to be critical for binding to the human ACE2 receptor and determining host range1. Using coordinates based on the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV, they are Y442, L472, N479, D480, T487, and Y4911. The corresponding residues in SARS-CoV-2 are L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501, and Y505. Five of these six residues are mutated in SARS-CoV-2 compared to its most closely related virus, RaTG13 sampled from a  Rhinolophus affinis  bat, to which it is ~96% identical2 (Figure 1a). Based on modeling1 and biochemical experiments3,4, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have an RBD that may bind with high affinity to ACE2 from human, non-human primate, ferret, pig, and cat, as well as other species with high receptor homology1. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 may bind less efficiently to ACE2 in other species associated with SARS-like viruses, including rodents and civets1.The phenylalanine (F) at residue 486 in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein corresponds to L472 in the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. Notably, in SARS-CoV cell culture experiments the L472 mutates to phenylalanine (L472F)5, which is predicted to be optimal for binding of the SARS-CoV RBD to the human ACE2 receptor6. However, a phenylalanine in this position is also present in several SARS-like CoVs from bats (Figure 1a). While these analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of binding the human ACE2 receptor with high affinity, the interaction is not predicted to be optimal1. Additionally, several of the key residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 are different to those previously described as optimal for human ACE2 receptor binding6. In contrast to these computational predictions, recent binding studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 binds with high affinity to human ACE27. Thus the SARS-CoV-2 spike appears to be the result of selection on human or human-like ACE2 permitting another optimal binding solution to arise. This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is  not  the product of genetic engineering.The second notable feature of SARS-CoV-2 is a predicted polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2, the two subunits of the spike protein (Figure 1b)8,9. In addition to two basic arginines and an alanine at the cleavage site, a leading proline is also inserted; thus, the fully inserted sequence is PRRA (Figure 1b). The strong turn created by the proline insertion is predicted to result in the addition of O-linked glycans to S673, T678, and S686 that flank the polybasic cleavage site. A polybasic cleavage site has not previously been observed in related lineage B betacoronaviruses and is a unique feature of SARS-CoV-2. Some human betacoronaviruses, including HCoV-HKU1 (lineage A), have polybasic cleavage sites, as well as predicted O-linked glycans near the S1/S2 cleavage site.While the functional consequence of the polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, experiments with SARS-CoV have shown that engineering such a site at the S1/S2 junction enhances cell\u2013cell fusion but does not affect virus entry10. Polybasic cleavage sites allow effective cleavage by furin and other proteases, and can be acquired at the junction of the two subunits of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of avian influenza viruses in conditions that select for rapid virus replication and transmission (e.g. highly dense chicken populations). HA serves a similar function in cell-cell fusion and viral entry as the coronavirus S protein. Acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site in HA, by either insertion or recombination, converts low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses into highly pathogenic forms11-13. The acquisition of polybasic cleavage sites by the influenza virus HA has also been observed after repeated forced passage in cell culture or through animals14,15. Similarly, an avirulent isolate of Newcastle Disease virus became highly pathogenic during serial passage in chickens by incremental acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site at the junction of its fusion protein subunits16. The potential function of the three predicted O-linked glycans is less clear, but they could create a \u201cmucin-like domain\u201d that would shield potential epitopes or key residues on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Biochemical analyses or structural studies are required to determine whether or not the predicted O-linked glycan sites are utilized.figure2718\u00d71487 394 KBFigure 1. (a) Mutations in contact residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (top) was aligned against the most closely related SARS-like CoVs and SARS-CoV-1. Key residues in the spike protein that make contact to the ACE2 receptor are marked with blue boxes in both SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. ( b) Acquisition of polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans.  The polybasic cleavage site is marked in grey with the three adjacent predicted O-linked glycans in blue. Both the polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and not previously seen in lineage B betacoronaviruses. Sequences shown are from NCBI GenBank, accession numbers MN908947, MN996532, AY278741, KY417146, MK211376. The pangolin coronavirus sequences are a consensus generated from SRR10168377 and SRR10168378 (NCBI BioProject PRJNA573298)18,19.It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of an existing SARS-related coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for human ACE2 receptor binding with an efficient binding solution different to that which would have been predicted. Further, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one would expect that one of the several reverse genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would have been used. However, this is not the case as the genetic data shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone17. Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in a non-human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage in culture could have given rise to the same observed features.Selection in an animal host. As many of the early cases of COVID-19 were linked to the Huanan seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, it is possible that an animal source was present at this location. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, particularly RaTG13, it is plausible that bats serve as reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2. It is important, however, to note that previous outbreaks of betacoronaviruses in humans involved direct exposure to animals other than bats, including civets (SARS) and camels (MERS), that carry viruses that are genetically very similar to SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, respectively. By analogy, viruses closely related to SARS-Cov-2 may be circulating in one or more animal species. Initial analyses indicate that Malayan pangolins ( Manis javanica ) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain a CoV that is similar to SARS-CoV-218,19. Although the bat virus RaTG13 remains the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 across the whole genome, the Malayan pangolin CoV is identical to SARS-CoV-2 at all six key RBD residues (Figure 1). However, no pangolin CoV has yet been identified that is sufficiently similar to SARS-CoV-2 across its entire genome to support direct human infection. In addition, the pangolin CoV does not carry a polybasic cleavage site insertion. For a precursor virus to acquire the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the spike protein suitable for human ACE2 receptor binding, an animal host would likely have to have a high population density \u2013 to allow natural selection to proceed efficiently \u2013 and an ACE2 gene that is similar to the human orthologue. Further characterization of CoVs in pangolins and other animals that may harbour SARS-CoV-like viruses should be a public health priority.Cryptic adaptation to humans. It is also possible that a progenitor to SARS-CoV-2 jumped from a non-human animal to humans, with the genomic features described above acquired through adaptation during subsequent human-to-human transmission. We surmise that once these adaptations were acquired (either together or in series) it would enable the outbreak to take-off, producing a sufficiently large and unusual cluster of pneumonia cases to trigger the surveillance system that ultimately detected it.All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced so far have the well adapted RBD and the polybasic cleavage site, and are thus derived from a common ancestor that had these features. The presence of an RBD in pangolins that is very similar to the one in SARS-CoV-2 means that this was likely already present in the virus that jumped to humans, even if we don\u2019t yet have the exact non-human progenitor virus. This leaves the polybasic cleavage site insertion to occur during human-to-human transmission. Following the example of the influenza A virus HA gene, a specific insertion or recombination event is required to enable the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as an epidemic pathogen.Estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 using currently available genome sequence data point to virus emergence in late November to early December 201920,21, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases22. Hence, this scenario presumes a period of unrecognised transmission in humans between the initial zoonotic transfer event and the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site. Sufficient opportunity could occur if there had been many prior zoonotic events producing short chains of human-to-human transmission (so-called \u2018stuttering chains\u2019) over an extended period. This is essentially the situation for MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula where all the human cases are the result of repeated jumps of the virus from dromedary camels, producing single infections or short chains of transmission that eventually resolve. To date, after 2,499 cases over 8 years, no human adaptation has emerged that has allowed MERS-CoV to take hold in the human population.How could we test whether cryptic spread of SARS-CoV-2 enabled human adaptation?  Metagenomic studies of banked serum samples could provide important information, but given the relatively short period of viremia it may be impossible to detect low level SARS-CoV-2 circulation in historical samples. Retrospective serological studies potentially could be informative and a few such studies have already been conducted. One found that animal importation traders had a 13% seropositivity to coronaviruses23, while another noted that 3% residents of a village in Southern China were seropositive to these viruses24. Interestingly, 200 residents of Wuhan did not show coronavirus seroreactivity. Critically, however, these studies could not have distinguished whether positive serological responses were due to a prior infection with SARS-CoV-1 or -2. Further retrospective serological studies should be conducted to determine the extent of prior human exposure to betacoronaviruses in different geographic areas, particularly using assays that can distinguish among multiple betacoronaviruses.Selection during passage. Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models have been ongoing in BSL-2 for many years in multiple laboratories across the world25-28. There are also documented instances of the laboratory acquisition of SARS-CoV-1 by laboratory personnel working under BSL-2 containment29,30. We must therefore consider the possibility of a deliberate or inadvertent release of SARS-CoV-2. In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired the observed RBD mutations site during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in studies with SARS-CoV5 as well as MERS-CoV31. However, the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site or O-linked glycans - if functional - argues against this scenario. New polybasic cleavage sites have only been observed after prolonged passaging of low pathogenicity avian influenza virus in cell culture or animals. Furthermore, the generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with a very high genetic similarity. Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required an intense program of passage in cell culture or animals with ACE-2 receptor similar to humans (e.g. ferrets). It is also questionable whether generation of the O-linked glycans would have occurred on cell culture passage, as such mutations typically suggest the involvement of an immune system, that is not present  in vitro .In the midst of the global COVID-19 public health emergency it is reasonable to wonder why the origins of the epidemic matter. A detailed understanding of how an animal virus jumped species boundaries to infect humans so productively will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events. For example, if SARS-CoV-2 pre-adapted in another animal species then we are at risk of future re-emergence events even if the current epidemic is controlled. In contrast, if the adaptive process we describe occurred in humans, then even if we have repeated zoonotic transfers they are unlikely to take-off unless the same series of mutations occurs. In addition, identifying the closest animal relatives of SARS-CoV-2 will greatly assist studies of virus function. Indeed, the availability of the RaTG13 bat sequence facilitated the comparative genomic analysis performed here, helping to reveal the key mutations in the RBD as well as the polybasic cleavage site insertion.The genomic features described here may in part explain the infectiousness and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Although genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here, and it is unclear whether future data will help resolve this issue. Identifying the immediate non-human animal source and obtaining virus sequences from it would be the most definitive way of revealing virus origins. In addition, it would be helpful to obtain more genetic and functional data about the virus, including experimental studies of receptor binding and the role of the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans. The identification of a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the sequencing of very early cases including those not connected to the Wuhan market, would similarly be highly informative. Irrespective of how SARS-CoV-2 originated, the ongoing surveillance of pneumonia in humans and other animals is clearly of utmost importance.We thank all those who have contributed SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and contributed analyses and ideas to Virological.org (http://virological.org/).

I would add, however, that even if two virus isolates have an IDENTICAL amino acid sequence, that would not automatically make one the origin of the other. In my post 10 days ago, Tackling Rumors of a Suspicious Origin of nCoV2019 , I showed that mutations in the 3rd wobble base in an otherwise conserved region accumulate as to make seemingly identical viruses very much separated in time \u2013 indeed over decades.It is time to leave playing \u201cwho\u2019s ur daddy\u201d to daytime television. No known viral RNA sequence is the daddy of SARS-CoV-2. No match. If it doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit. It is all bat guano. Whatever analogy you like.

Andersen\nDepartment of Immunology and Microbiology,\nThe Scripps Research Institute,\nLa Jolla, CA 92037,\nUSA.Since the first reports of a novel pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China there has been considerable discussion and uncertainty over the origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 are now widespread in China, with cases in every province. As of 14 February 2020, 64,473 such cases have been confirmed, with 1,384 deaths attributed to the virus. These official case numbers are likely an underestimate because of limited reporting of mild and asymptomatic cases, and the virus is clearly capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. Based on the possibility of spread to countries with weaker healthcare systems, the World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). There are currently neither vaccines nor specific treatments for this disease.SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the  Coronaviridae  known to infect humans. Three of these viruses, SARS CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, can cause severe disease; four, HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E, are associated with mild respiratory symptoms. Herein, we review what can be deduced about the origin and early evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from the comparative analysis of available genome sequence data. In particular, we offer a perspective on the notable features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and discuss scenarios by which these features could have arisen. Importantly, this analysis provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct nor a purposefully manipulated virus.The genomic comparison of both alpha- and betacoronaviruses (family  Coronaviridae ) described below identifies two notable features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (i) based on structural modelling and early biochemical experiments, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be optimized for binding to the human ACE2 receptor; (ii) the highly variable spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1 and S2 boundary via the insertion of twelve nucleotides. Additionally, this event led to the acquisition of three predicted O-linked glycans around the polybasic cleavage site.The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses is the most variable part of the virus genome. Six residues in the RBD appear to be critical for binding to the human ACE2 receptor and determining host range1. Using coordinates based on the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV, they are Y442, L472, N479, D480, T487, and Y4911. The corresponding residues in SARS-CoV-2 are L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501, and Y505. Five of these six residues are mutated in SARS-CoV-2 compared to its most closely related virus, RaTG13 sampled from a  Rhinolophus affinis  bat, to which it is ~96% identical2 (Figure 1a). Based on modeling1 and biochemical experiments3,4, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have an RBD that may bind with high affinity to ACE2 from human, non-human primate, ferret, pig, and cat, as well as other species with high receptor homology1. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 may bind less efficiently to ACE2 in other species associated with SARS-like viruses, including rodents and civets1.The phenylalanine (F) at residue 486 in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein corresponds to L472 in the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. Notably, in SARS-CoV cell culture experiments the L472 mutates to phenylalanine (L472F)5, which is predicted to be optimal for binding of the SARS-CoV RBD to the human ACE2 receptor6. However, a phenylalanine in this position is also present in several SARS-like CoVs from bats (Figure 1a). While these analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of binding the human ACE2 receptor with high affinity, the interaction is not predicted to be optimal1. Additionally, several of the key residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 are different to those previously described as optimal for human ACE2 receptor binding6. In contrast to these computational predictions, recent binding studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 binds with high affinity to human ACE27. Thus the SARS-CoV-2 spike appears to be the result of selection on human or human-like ACE2 permitting another optimal binding solution to arise. This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is  not  the product of genetic engineering.The second notable feature of SARS-CoV-2 is a predicted polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2, the two subunits of the spike protein (Figure 1b)8,9. In addition to two basic arginines and an alanine at the cleavage site, a leading proline is also inserted; thus, the fully inserted sequence is PRRA (Figure 1b). The strong turn created by the proline insertion is predicted to result in the addition of O-linked glycans to S673, T678, and S686 that flank the polybasic cleavage site. A polybasic cleavage site has not previously been observed in related lineage B betacoronaviruses and is a unique feature of SARS-CoV-2. Some human betacoronaviruses, including HCoV-HKU1 (lineage A), have polybasic cleavage sites, as well as predicted O-linked glycans near the S1/S2 cleavage site.While the functional consequence of the polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, experiments with SARS-CoV have shown that engineering such a site at the S1/S2 junction enhances cell\u2013cell fusion but does not affect virus entry10. Polybasic cleavage sites allow effective cleavage by furin and other proteases, and can be acquired at the junction of the two subunits of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of avian influenza viruses in conditions that select for rapid virus replication and transmission (e.g. highly dense chicken populations). HA serves a similar function in cell-cell fusion and viral entry as the coronavirus S protein. Acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site in HA, by either insertion or recombination, converts low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses into highly pathogenic forms11-13. The acquisition of polybasic cleavage sites by the influenza virus HA has also been observed after repeated forced passage in cell culture or through animals14,15. Similarly, an avirulent isolate of Newcastle Disease virus became highly pathogenic during serial passage in chickens by incremental acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site at the junction of its fusion protein subunits16. The potential function of the three predicted O-linked glycans is less clear, but they could create a \u201cmucin-like domain\u201d that would shield potential epitopes or key residues on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Biochemical analyses or structural studies are required to determine whether or not the predicted O-linked glycan sites are utilized.figure2718\u00d71487 394 KBFigure 1. (a) Mutations in contact residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (top) was aligned against the most closely related SARS-like CoVs and SARS-CoV-1. Key residues in the spike protein that make contact to the ACE2 receptor are marked with blue boxes in both SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. ( b) Acquisition of polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans.  The polybasic cleavage site is marked in grey with the three adjacent predicted O-linked glycans in blue. Both the polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and not previously seen in lineage B betacoronaviruses. Sequences shown are from NCBI GenBank, accession numbers MN908947, MN996532, AY278741, KY417146, MK211376. The pangolin coronavirus sequences are a consensus generated from SRR10168377 and SRR10168378 (NCBI BioProject PRJNA573298)18,19.It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of an existing SARS-related coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for human ACE2 receptor binding with an efficient binding solution different to that which would have been predicted. Further, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one would expect that one of the several reverse genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would have been used. However, this is not the case as the genetic data shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone17. Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in a non-human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage in culture could have given rise to the same observed features.Selection in an animal host. As many of the early cases of COVID-19 were linked to the Huanan seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, it is possible that an animal source was present at this location. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, particularly RaTG13, it is plausible that bats serve as reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2. It is important, however, to note that previous outbreaks of betacoronaviruses in humans involved direct exposure to animals other than bats, including civets (SARS) and camels (MERS), that carry viruses that are genetically very similar to SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, respectively. By analogy, viruses closely related to SARS-Cov-2 may be circulating in one or more animal species. Initial analyses indicate that Malayan pangolins ( Manis javanica ) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain a CoV that is similar to SARS-CoV-218,19. Although the bat virus RaTG13 remains the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 across the whole genome, the Malayan pangolin CoV is identical to SARS-CoV-2 at all six key RBD residues (Figure 1). However, no pangolin CoV has yet been identified that is sufficiently similar to SARS-CoV-2 across its entire genome to support direct human infection. In addition, the pangolin CoV does not carry a polybasic cleavage site insertion. For a precursor virus to acquire the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the spike protein suitable for human ACE2 receptor binding, an animal host would likely have to have a high population density \u2013 to allow natural selection to proceed efficiently \u2013 and an ACE2 gene that is similar to the human orthologue. Further characterization of CoVs in pangolins and other animals that may harbour SARS-CoV-like viruses should be a public health priority.Cryptic adaptation to humans. It is also possible that a progenitor to SARS-CoV-2 jumped from a non-human animal to humans, with the genomic features described above acquired through adaptation during subsequent human-to-human transmission. We surmise that once these adaptations were acquired (either together or in series) it would enable the outbreak to take-off, producing a sufficiently large and unusual cluster of pneumonia cases to trigger the surveillance system that ultimately detected it.All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced so far have the well adapted RBD and the polybasic cleavage site, and are thus derived from a common ancestor that had these features. The presence of an RBD in pangolins that is very similar to the one in SARS-CoV-2 means that this was likely already present in the virus that jumped to humans, even if we don\u2019t yet have the exact non-human progenitor virus. This leaves the polybasic cleavage site insertion to occur during human-to-human transmission. Following the example of the influenza A virus HA gene, a specific insertion or recombination event is required to enable the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as an epidemic pathogen.Estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 using currently available genome sequence data point to virus emergence in late November to early December 201920,21, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases22. Hence, this scenario presumes a period of unrecognised transmission in humans between the initial zoonotic transfer event and the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site. Sufficient opportunity could occur if there had been many prior zoonotic events producing short chains of human-to-human transmission (so-called \u2018stuttering chains\u2019) over an extended period. This is essentially the situation for MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula where all the human cases are the result of repeated jumps of the virus from dromedary camels, producing single infections or short chains of transmission that eventually resolve. To date, after 2,499 cases over 8 years, no human adaptation has emerged that has allowed MERS-CoV to take hold in the human population.How could we test whether cryptic spread of SARS-CoV-2 enabled human adaptation?  Metagenomic studies of banked serum samples could provide important information, but given the relatively short period of viremia it may be impossible to detect low level SARS-CoV-2 circulation in historical samples. Retrospective serological studies potentially could be informative and a few such studies have already been conducted. One found that animal importation traders had a 13% seropositivity to coronaviruses23, while another noted that 3% residents of a village in Southern China were seropositive to these viruses24. Interestingly, 200 residents of Wuhan did not show coronavirus seroreactivity. Critically, however, these studies could not have distinguished whether positive serological responses were due to a prior infection with SARS-CoV-1 or -2. Further retrospective serological studies should be conducted to determine the extent of prior human exposure to betacoronaviruses in different geographic areas, particularly using assays that can distinguish among multiple betacoronaviruses.Selection during passage. Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models have been ongoing in BSL-2 for many years in multiple laboratories across the world25-28. There are also documented instances of the laboratory acquisition of SARS-CoV-1 by laboratory personnel working under BSL-2 containment29,30. We must therefore consider the possibility of a deliberate or inadvertent release of SARS-CoV-2. In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired the observed RBD mutations site during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in studies with SARS-CoV5 as well as MERS-CoV31. However, the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site or O-linked glycans - if functional - argues against this scenario. New polybasic cleavage sites have only been observed after prolonged passaging of low pathogenicity avian influenza virus in cell culture or animals. Furthermore, the generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with a very high genetic similarity. Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required an intense program of passage in cell culture or animals with ACE-2 receptor similar to humans (e.g. ferrets). It is also questionable whether generation of the O-linked glycans would have occurred on cell culture passage, as such mutations typically suggest the involvement of an immune system, that is not present  in vitro .In the midst of the global COVID-19 public health emergency it is reasonable to wonder why the origins of the epidemic matter. A detailed understanding of how an animal virus jumped species boundaries to infect humans so productively will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events. For example, if SARS-CoV-2 pre-adapted in another animal species then we are at risk of future re-emergence events even if the current epidemic is controlled. In contrast, if the adaptive process we describe occurred in humans, then even if we have repeated zoonotic transfers they are unlikely to take-off unless the same series of mutations occurs. In addition, identifying the closest animal relatives of SARS-CoV-2 will greatly assist studies of virus function. Indeed, the availability of the RaTG13 bat sequence facilitated the comparative genomic analysis performed here, helping to reveal the key mutations in the RBD as well as the polybasic cleavage site insertion.The genomic features described here may in part explain the infectiousness and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Although genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here, and it is unclear whether future data will help resolve this issue. Identifying the immediate non-human animal source and obtaining virus sequences from it would be the most definitive way of revealing virus origins. In addition, it would be helpful to obtain more genetic and functional data about the virus, including experimental studies of receptor binding and the role of the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans. The identification of a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the sequencing of very early cases including those not connected to the Wuhan market, would similarly be highly informative. Irrespective of how SARS-CoV-2 originated, the ongoing surveillance of pneumonia in humans and other animals is clearly of utmost importance.We thank all those who have contributed SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and contributed analyses and ideas to Virological.org (http://virological.org/).

I would add, however, that even if two virus isolates have an IDENTICAL amino acid sequence, that would not automatically make one the origin of the other. In my post 10 days ago, Tackling Rumors of a Suspicious Origin of nCoV2019 , I showed that mutations in the 3rd wobble base in an otherwise conserved region accumulate as to make seemingly identical viruses very much separated in time \u2013 indeed over decades.It is time to leave playing \u201cwho\u2019s ur daddy\u201d to daytime television. No known viral RNA sequence is the daddy of SARS-CoV-2. No match. If it doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit. It is all bat guano. Whatever analogy you like. A thrust of distrust and recrimination is not the path to protecting the planet from a viral catastrophe.Bill GallaherMandarin translation thanks to CHEN Guo from the Center for Infection and Immunity in the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health.The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2_ChineseSummary.pdf (198.5 KB)Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled",

Andersen\nDepartment of Immunology and Microbiology,\nThe Scripps Research Institute,\nLa Jolla, CA 92037,\nUSA.Since the first reports of a novel pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China there has been considerable discussion and uncertainty over the origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 are now widespread in China, with cases in every province. As of 14 February 2020, 64,473 such cases have been confirmed, with 1,384 deaths attributed to the virus. These official case numbers are likely an underestimate because of limited reporting of mild and asymptomatic cases, and the virus is clearly capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. Based on the possibility of spread to countries with weaker healthcare systems, the World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). There are currently neither vaccines nor specific treatments for this disease.SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the  Coronaviridae  known to infect humans. Three of these viruses, SARS CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, can cause severe disease; four, HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E, are associated with mild respiratory symptoms. Herein, we review what can be deduced about the origin and early evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from the comparative analysis of available genome sequence data. In particular, we offer a perspective on the notable features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and discuss scenarios by which these features could have arisen. Importantly, this analysis provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct nor a purposefully manipulated virus.The genomic comparison of both alpha- and betacoronaviruses (family  Coronaviridae ) described below identifies two notable features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (i) based on structural modelling and early biochemical experiments, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be optimized for binding to the human ACE2 receptor; (ii) the highly variable spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1 and S2 boundary via the insertion of twelve nucleotides. Additionally, this event led to the acquisition of three predicted O-linked glycans around the polybasic cleavage site.The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses is the most variable part of the virus genome. Six residues in the RBD appear to be critical for binding to the human ACE2 receptor and determining host range1. Using coordinates based on the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV, they are Y442, L472, N479, D480, T487, and Y4911. The corresponding residues in SARS-CoV-2 are L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501, and Y505. Five of these six residues are mutated in SARS-CoV-2 compared to its most closely related virus, RaTG13 sampled from a  Rhinolophus affinis  bat, to which it is ~96% identical2 (Figure 1a). Based on modeling1 and biochemical experiments3,4, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have an RBD that may bind with high affinity to ACE2 from human, non-human primate, ferret, pig, and cat, as well as other species with high receptor homology1. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 may bind less efficiently to ACE2 in other species associated with SARS-like viruses, including rodents and civets1.The phenylalanine (F) at residue 486 in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein corresponds to L472 in the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. Notably, in SARS-CoV cell culture experiments the L472 mutates to phenylalanine (L472F)5, which is predicted to be optimal for binding of the SARS-CoV RBD to the human ACE2 receptor6. However, a phenylalanine in this position is also present in several SARS-like CoVs from bats (Figure 1a). While these analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of binding the human ACE2 receptor with high affinity, the interaction is not predicted to be optimal1. Additionally, several of the key residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 are different to those previously described as optimal for human ACE2 receptor binding6. In contrast to these computational predictions, recent binding studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 binds with high affinity to human ACE27. Thus the SARS-CoV-2 spike appears to be the result of selection on human or human-like ACE2 permitting another optimal binding solution to arise. This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is  not  the product of genetic engineering.The second notable feature of SARS-CoV-2 is a predicted polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2, the two subunits of the spike protein (Figure 1b)8,9. In addition to two basic arginines and an alanine at the cleavage site, a leading proline is also inserted; thus, the fully inserted sequence is PRRA (Figure 1b). The strong turn created by the proline insertion is predicted to result in the addition of O-linked glycans to S673, T678, and S686 that flank the polybasic cleavage site. A polybasic cleavage site has not previously been observed in related lineage B betacoronaviruses and is a unique feature of SARS-CoV-2. Some human betacoronaviruses, including HCoV-HKU1 (lineage A), have polybasic cleavage sites, as well as predicted O-linked glycans near the S1/S2 cleavage site.While the functional consequence of the polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, experiments with SARS-CoV have shown that engineering such a site at the S1/S2 junction enhances cell\u2013cell fusion but does not affect virus entry10. Polybasic cleavage sites allow effective cleavage by furin and other proteases, and can be acquired at the junction of the two subunits of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of avian influenza viruses in conditions that select for rapid virus replication and transmission (e.g. highly dense chicken populations). HA serves a similar function in cell-cell fusion and viral entry as the coronavirus S protein. Acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site in HA, by either insertion or recombination, converts low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses into highly pathogenic forms11-13. The acquisition of polybasic cleavage sites by the influenza virus HA has also been observed after repeated forced passage in cell culture or through animals14,15. Similarly, an avirulent isolate of Newcastle Disease virus became highly pathogenic during serial passage in chickens by incremental acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site at the junction of its fusion protein subunits16. The potential function of the three predicted O-linked glycans is less clear, but they could create a \u201cmucin-like domain\u201d that would shield potential epitopes or key residues on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Biochemical analyses or structural studies are required to determine whether or not the predicted O-linked glycan sites are utilized.figure2718\u00d71487 394 KBFigure 1. (a) Mutations in contact residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (top) was aligned against the most closely related SARS-like CoVs and SARS-CoV-1. Key residues in the spike protein that make contact to the ACE2 receptor are marked with blue boxes in both SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. ( b) Acquisition of polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans.  The polybasic cleavage site is marked in grey with the three adjacent predicted O-linked glycans in blue. Both the polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and not previously seen in lineage B betacoronaviruses. Sequences shown are from NCBI GenBank, accession numbers MN908947, MN996532, AY278741, KY417146, MK211376. The pangolin coronavirus sequences are a consensus generated from SRR10168377 and SRR10168378 (NCBI BioProject PRJNA573298)18,19.It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of an existing SARS-related coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for human ACE2 receptor binding with an efficient binding solution different to that which would have been predicted. Further, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one would expect that one of the several reverse genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would have been used. However, this is not the case as the genetic data shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone17. Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in a non-human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage in culture could have given rise to the same observed features.Selection in an animal host. As many of the early cases of COVID-19 were linked to the Huanan seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, it is possible that an animal source was present at this location. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, particularly RaTG13, it is plausible that bats serve as reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2. It is important, however, to note that previous outbreaks of betacoronaviruses in humans involved direct exposure to animals other than bats, including civets (SARS) and camels (MERS), that carry viruses that are genetically very similar to SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, respectively. By analogy, viruses closely related to SARS-Cov-2 may be circulating in one or more animal species. Initial analyses indicate that Malayan pangolins ( Manis javanica ) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain a CoV that is similar to SARS-CoV-218,19. Although the bat virus RaTG13 remains the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 across the whole genome, the Malayan pangolin CoV is identical to SARS-CoV-2 at all six key RBD residues (Figure 1). However, no pangolin CoV has yet been identified that is sufficiently similar to SARS-CoV-2 across its entire genome to support direct human infection. In addition, the pangolin CoV does not carry a polybasic cleavage site insertion. For a precursor virus to acquire the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the spike protein suitable for human ACE2 receptor binding, an animal host would likely have to have a high population density \u2013 to allow natural selection to proceed efficiently \u2013 and an ACE2 gene that is similar to the human orthologue. Further characterization of CoVs in pangolins and other animals that may harbour SARS-CoV-like viruses should be a public health priority.Cryptic adaptation to humans. It is also possible that a progenitor to SARS-CoV-2 jumped from a non-human animal to humans, with the genomic features described above acquired through adaptation during subsequent human-to-human transmission. We surmise that once these adaptations were acquired (either together or in series) it would enable the outbreak to take-off, producing a sufficiently large and unusual cluster of pneumonia cases to trigger the surveillance system that ultimately detected it.All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced so far have the well adapted RBD and the polybasic cleavage site, and are thus derived from a common ancestor that had these features. The presence of an RBD in pangolins that is very similar to the one in SARS-CoV-2 means that this was likely already present in the virus that jumped to humans, even if we don\u2019t yet have the exact non-human progenitor virus. This leaves the polybasic cleavage site insertion to occur during human-to-human transmission. Following the example of the influenza A virus HA gene, a specific insertion or recombination event is required to enable the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as an epidemic pathogen.Estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 using currently available genome sequence data point to virus emergence in late November to early December 201920,21, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases22. Hence, this scenario presumes a period of unrecognised transmission in humans between the initial zoonotic transfer event and the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site. Sufficient opportunity could occur if there had been many prior zoonotic events producing short chains of human-to-human transmission (so-called \u2018stuttering chains\u2019) over an extended period. This is essentially the situation for MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula where all the human cases are the result of repeated jumps of the virus from dromedary camels, producing single infections or short chains of transmission that eventually resolve. To date, after 2,499 cases over 8 years, no human adaptation has emerged that has allowed MERS-CoV to take hold in the human population.How could we test whether cryptic spread of SARS-CoV-2 enabled human adaptation?  Metagenomic studies of banked serum samples could provide important information, but given the relatively short period of viremia it may be impossible to detect low level SARS-CoV-2 circulation in historical samples. Retrospective serological studies potentially could be informative and a few such studies have already been conducted. One found that animal importation traders had a 13% seropositivity to coronaviruses23, while another noted that 3% residents of a village in Southern China were seropositive to these viruses24. Interestingly, 200 residents of Wuhan did not show coronavirus seroreactivity. Critically, however, these studies could not have distinguished whether positive serological responses were due to a prior infection with SARS-CoV-1 or -2. Further retrospective serological studies should be conducted to determine the extent of prior human exposure to betacoronaviruses in different geographic areas, particularly using assays that can distinguish among multiple betacoronaviruses.Selection during passage. Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models have been ongoing in BSL-2 for many years in multiple laboratories across the world25-28. There are also documented instances of the laboratory acquisition of SARS-CoV-1 by laboratory personnel working under BSL-2 containment29,30. We must therefore consider the possibility of a deliberate or inadvertent release of SARS-CoV-2. In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired the observed RBD mutations site during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in studies with SARS-CoV5 as well as MERS-CoV31. However, the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site or O-linked glycans - if functional - argues against this scenario. New polybasic cleavage sites have only been observed after prolonged passaging of low pathogenicity avian influenza virus in cell culture or animals. Furthermore, the generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with a very high genetic similarity. Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required an intense program of passage in cell culture or animals with ACE-2 receptor similar to humans (e.g. ferrets). It is also questionable whether generation of the O-linked glycans would have occurred on cell culture passage, as such mutations typically suggest the involvement of an immune system, that is not present  in vitro .In the midst of the global COVID-19 public health emergency it is reasonable to wonder why the origins of the epidemic matter. A detailed understanding of how an animal virus jumped species boundaries to infect humans so productively will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events. For example, if SARS-CoV-2 pre-adapted in another animal species then we are at risk of future re-emergence events even if the current epidemic is controlled. In contrast, if the adaptive process we describe occurred in humans, then even if we have repeated zoonotic transfers they are unlikely to take-off unless the same series of mutations occurs. In addition, identifying the closest animal relatives of SARS-CoV-2 will greatly assist studies of virus function. Indeed, the availability of the RaTG13 bat sequence facilitated the comparative genomic analysis performed here, helping to reveal the key mutations in the RBD as well as the polybasic cleavage site insertion.The genomic features described here may in part explain the infectiousness and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Although genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here, and it is unclear whether future data will help resolve this issue. Identifying the immediate non-human animal source and obtaining virus sequences from it would be the most definitive way of revealing virus origins. In addition, it would be helpful to obtain more genetic and functional data about the virus, including experimental studies of receptor binding and the role of the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans. The identification of a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the sequencing of very early cases including those not connected to the Wuhan market, would similarly be highly informative. Irrespective of how SARS-CoV-2 originated, the ongoing surveillance of pneumonia in humans and other animals is clearly of utmost importance.We thank all those who have contributed SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and contributed analyses and ideas to Virological.org (http://virological.org/).

No known viral RNA sequence is the daddy of SARS-CoV-2. No match. If it doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit. It is all bat guano. Whatever analogy you like. A thrust of distrust and recrimination is not the path to protecting the planet from a viral catastrophe.Bill GallaherMandarin translation thanks to CHEN Guo from the Center for Infection and Immunity in the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health.The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2_ChineseSummary.pdf (198.5 KB)Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled",

            "main_text": "Background: \nSince the first cluster of cases was identified in Wuhan City, China, in December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across China, causing multiple introductions in 109 countries/territories/areas as of March 10th. Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently more evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of this emerging disease. In this study, we derive estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources.\nMethods: \nWe employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For this purpose, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were integrated into our analysis.\nResults: \nOur posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China in 2019-2020 reached values as high as 5.20 (95%CrI: 5.04-5.47) and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23rd in 2020 was associated with a declined R at 0.58 (95%CrI: 0.51-0.64), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 1905526 (95%CrI: 1350283-2655936) in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 19.1% (95%CrI: 13.5-26.6%). We also found that most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be 0.04% (95% CrI: 0.03-0.06%) and 0.12% (95%CrI: 0.08-0.17%), which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR estimated at 4.19%\nConclusions: \nWe have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China during January-February, 2020 using an ecological modelling approach. The power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems.The authors have declared no competing interest.KM acknowledges support from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grant Number 18K17368 and from the Leading Initiative for Excellent Young Researchers from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science & Technology of Japan.

The examination dates will also be adjusted accordingly.As of February 15, all 63 provinces and cities in Vietnam have extended their school closing time, 56 of which \u2014 including Saigon \u2014 have announced that schools will be closed until the end of February, according to the news source.Amidst the worrying spread of Covid-19, the Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s People Committee is also proposing to the central government and the education and training ministry to let students stay at home until the end of March. The proposed second term of the academic year will then start instead in April and end in July this year. The new academic term will start in September and the summer holiday will be shortened to one month.The HCMC Department of Education and Training has also sent a dispatch encouraging schools and universities to change their teaching methods to ones that stimulate self-learning and research.While most schools and parents agree on closing schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic, long breaks have taken a toll on parents, especially factory workers who have small children. Tuoi Tre mentioned in a different report that since these workers still have to go to work, a lot of them are struggling to find babysitting help.[Photo: Staff members of a school in Hanoi clean campus facilities during the extended break/Facebook page Truong Nguyen Sieu]Saigoneer in Health\n\n1 MONTH AGOVietnam experienced a dramatic weekend related to the coronavirus spreading out of Wuhan, China.Saigoneer in Health\n\n2 DAYS AGONine new coronavirus cases in Vietnam have been confirmed within the last three days.Saigoneer in Vietnam\n\n20 DAYS AGOSouth Korea is in the midst of a rapid surge of Covid-19 cases, and now has the most confirmed infections outside of China: 763 cases and seven deaths at the time of writing.Saigoneer in Health\n\n6 MONTHS AGOThe oft-debated new draft Law on Preventing Alcohol's Harmful Effects has seen new proposals from the Ministry of Health.Saigoneer in Health\n\n10 MONTHS AGOIn 2018, Vietnam's total beer consumption reached over 4.67 billion liters, according to Nielsen statistics.Saigoneer in Travel\n\n16 DAYS AGOThe campaigns are the effort to compensate for the losses in tourism revenue due to the Covid-19 epidemic.",

            "main_text": "Summary:Death toll passes 2,000 as Hubei reports 132 deaths for TuesdayJapan to release first wave of 500 passengers + crew at 10:30 am in TokyoFlorida health officials mysteriously refuse to share virus info with reportersRussia bars all Chinese from enteringNYT notes signs of impending economic distressSouth Korea announces \"emergency steps\" to prepare for outbreak.South Korea announces 15 new cases* * *Update (1940ET): It's Wednesday morning in Yokohama. So you know what that means.Japanese health authorities are beginning the process of offloading the remaining 2,000+ passengers and crew aboard the 'Diamond Princess', a ship that has been under quarantine for 14 days.The offloading will take place in phases over three days, finally wrapping up on Friday. The first 500 people are set to leave at around 10:30 am Tokyo time on Wednesday. There will be no preference given to different nationalities, according to Japan's Ministry of Health.Many who depart will be subject to another 14 days of quarantine, including any Americans who elected to stay on the ship instead of traveling back to the US on the evac flight. Roughly 40 Americans were also excluded from that flight because they were being treated for the virus in a Japanese hospital.So far, 542 people - including at least 14 of the 300 or so Americans who traveled back to the US on Monday in Japan - have tested positive for the virus. And while Japan says it has tested everybody aboard, doctors and experts say there's no way to certain that people being released won't be carrying the virus - hence the quarantines when they return home.But where will they go between now and then? And with no immediate after-care plans - at least none that have been publicly disclosed, it looks like Japan is about to set thousands of people aboard the most infected environment outside China loose in Tokyo.Of course, Japanese authorities are so paranoid about the Olympics, one would think they would be doing everything in their power to stop an outbreak in Tokyo, especially at such a sensitive time.About 500 people are set to leave the ship from around 10:30 a.m. Tokyo time on Wednesday, with no preference given to any particular nationality, Japan\u2019s Health Ministry said.Hopefully, health officials will manage to convince the world that they successfully screened for the virus.The ship was first quarantined on Feb. 5 more than a week after a man who tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong disembarked. Journalists have shared stories of desperation and paranoia from those trapped on the ship, making it sound like such a nightmare that many who read those stories may never want to travel on a cruise.In other news, Yonhap reported minutes ago that South Korea has another 15 cases, increasing the countries total by roughly one-third to 46 one day after the country's president warned of an \"economic emergency\" as companies like Hyundai suffer from supply shortages from China. The South Korean government has already announced a fiscal stimulus package to help companies hurt by the virus.* * *Update (1720ET): Health officials in Hubei reported a big jump in deaths on Tuesday, shattering the state's narrative that the virus is being beaten because the number of confirmed cases and deaths were falling.And with the new figures, the China death toll has hit 2,000 exactly, up from 1,868 deaths as of the end of Monday, according to China's NHC.Meanwhile, state officials in Florida are refusing to release any information about the state's efforts to contain a coronavirus outbreak, including data about the number of patients who have been tested for the virus, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\"The goal of this public health response is containment,\" said state Surgeon General Scott Rivkees, who presented to the Senate Health Policy committee Tuesday. \"And if there\u2019s a confirmed case, it will absolutely be reported.\"Rivkees added that the state wasn't allowed to release the information because of \"privacy concerns\" - likely a rule about patient confidentiality codified in the federal HIPPA guidelines.However, veteran journalists in the state pressed the surgeon general: These numbers were shared with the public during Zika, and since the numbers don't include any personalized details, there shouldn't be any conflict with HIPPA.Despite their protests, the state simply deferred to the Department of Health, which has created a 700-person incident management team to liaise with states and help the country prepare for the potential outbreak. Certain protocols have been shared with officials in every state.Though if not sharing this information is part of some kind of federal 'protocol', then how come Washington State is sharing some of this information directly on a Department of Public Health website?Also in the US: the CDC said earlier that the State Department is planning to bar any Americans who were aboard the Diamond Princess but didn't return with the evacuees from returning to the country until next month.* * *Update (1600ET): Writing in the latest update to its coronavirus live blog, the New York Times points out that more signs of economic pain from the outbreak have emerged on Tuesday. It cites HSBC's bloodletting, Jaguar's warning about looming production problems and Apple's latest production warning as worrying signs of corporate blowback even as the Nasdaq closed at a record high.Economic fallout from the new coronavirus epidemic continued to spread on Tuesday, with new evidence emerging in manufacturing, financial markets, commodities, banking and other sectors.HSBC, one of the most important banks in Hong Kong, said it plans to cut 35,000 jobs and $4.5 billion in costs as it faces headwinds that include the coronavirus outbreak and months of political strife in Hong Kong. The bank, based in London, had come to depend increasingly on China for growth.Jaguar Land Rover warned that the coronavirus could soon begin to create production problems at its assembly plants in Britain. Like many carmakers, Jaguar Land Rover uses parts made in China, where many factories have shut down or slowed production; Fiat Chrysler, Renault and Hyundai have already reported interruptions as a result.U.S. stocks declined on Tuesday, a day after Apple warned that it would miss its sales forecasts due to disruption in China, as concerns about the impact of the outbreak weighed on the outlook for the global economy.Stocks tied to the near-term ups and downs of the economy slumped, with energy, financials and industrial shares the leading losers. The S&P 500 index was down 0.5 percent at midafternoon in New York trading.Bond yields declined, with the 10-year Treasury note yielding 1.55 percent, suggesting\u00a0 investors are lowering their expectations for economic growth and inflation. With much of the Chinese economy stalled, demand for oil has fallen and prices were down on Tuesday, with a barrel of West Texas Intermediate selling for roughly $52.In Germany, where the economy depends heavily on global demand for machinery and automobiles, a key indicator showed economic sentiment has tumbled this month, as the economic outlook has weakened.You know it's bad when CNBC's unspoken economics 'Word of the Day' is 'one-off'.Meanwhile, America's 'paper of record' reported that at least 150 million people in China are living under severe lockdown restrictions confining them largely to their homes. That's one-tenth of China's population, and 1% of the global population.Kind of hard to work and consume when you can't leave the house.* * *Update (1410ET): In an interview with Fox News, the CDC's Dr. Anthony Fauci said the risk to Americans of contracting COVID-19 is relatively low right now, but that \"could change\" given the chaotic and unpredictable situation.\"The risk clearly is relatively low right now, but that could change. So we're telling our American citizens to not be fearful, to not be afraid, but to keep an eye on it.\"Dr. Fauci added that the federal government has quarantined every known case of the virus.\"The people in this country that were aware of being infected they've been contacted, isolated and made aware that this is the case.\"Just in case any get through, the US is starting 'sentinel surveillance' of patients around the country who go to the hospital to report flu-like symptoms, as we reported yesterday.\"That will give us a better idea of whether there are any cases that we haven't identified or noticed,\" the doctor added.Watch the clip below:THE HEADLINER: Dr. Anthony Fauci discusses the latest in the coronavirus outbreak #nine2noon pic.twitter.com/BLePf1Olyw* * *Update (1300ET): In a landmark decision, Russia has temporarily banned Chinese from entry as of Feb. 20, becoming the first country to ban all Chinese from entry in response to the coronavirus outbreak, according to Russian news agency TASS.This is only the latest step from Russia, which has already closed most entry points along its 4,200-kilometer border, suspended e-visas and work visas for Chinese nationals.Russia has already reported two cases of coronavirus - the only cases confirmed in the country so far - both involving Chinese nationals.Though there haven't been many cases, there have been a number of interesting virus-related headlines out of Russia in recent weeks. Two men in the city of Chelyabinsk were fined for hooliganism after they filmed a prank video where they pretended to shoot a man infected with the virus in a park. The men wore white hazmat suits and face masks while simulating the shooting of the third person, who wasn't actually infected.\u2014 Russia discharged a Chinese national from the hospital in the Siberian city of Chita on Wednesday after he recovered from a coronavirus infection, the second of Russia's two confirmed cases of coronavirus to recover. The other victim, also a Chinese national, was also said by authorities to have recovered and been released from quarantine in Siberia's Tyumen region.Meanwhile,apropos of nothing, BNO News shared one of the latest videos out of Hubei Province, which we'd like to now share with you.Video from Hubei province shows doctors running across the street to take patients who are critically ill with coronavirus to a new ICU unit. It took 30 minutes per patient, 10 in total - Xinhua pic.twitter.com/16XLrYzB8lThis could be an Olympic Sport (if they don't cancel the Olympics, that is).As a handful of brave foreign correspondents continue to report on the outbreak inside mainland China, the Epoch Times' reporter Jennifer Zeng revealed on Tuesday that 71 people from one workplace in Beijing have been placed under quarantine after one employee was infected by COVID-19.We're glad to see China's shift back to work is going so well.* * *Update (0840ET): Global Times editor Hu Xijin, a government mouthpiece whose tweets were closely followed during the 'Phase 1' trade-deal negotiations, is touting China's dubious data as a sign that the Communist Party is winning the 'People's War' against COVID-19.Daily new infection cases outside Hubei fell below 100 for the first time according to data released on Tuesday. We are on the way to the victory. People are in a better mood and cities are recovering the vitality. I myself is also very happy. pic.twitter.com/nTlxIhOwF4* * *Last night, the western press exposed the Americans for breaking Japan's quarantine on the 'Diamond Princess' by ferrying some 14 infected individuals to the US. But with one day left to go before the Japanese government ends its quarantine and releases thousands of terrified and paranoid passengers into the streets of Tokyo.On Tuesday, another 88 passengers from the Diamond Princess were diagnosed with the virus, bringing the total to 542.#BREAKING: Another 88 confirmed new #coronavirus cases from on board the Diamond Princess @abcnews pic.twitter.com/Ixp1XdpY0xJapan has completed tests for all passengers and crew aboard the ship as of Monday, but the results for the last batch of tests aren't expected until Wednesday, the day that the quarantine is slated to end. So far, results are back for 2,404 passengers and crew, out of the 3,711 who were\u00a0 on board the ship when the quarantine began on Feb. 5.Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said Tuesday that people who have tested negative for the virus would start leaving on Wednesday, but that the process of releasing passengers and crew won't be finished until Friday, according to the Washington Post.The remaining 61 American passengers on the DP who opted not to join the evacuation will not be allowed to return to the US until March 4, according to the American embassy in Tokyo. The governments of Australia, Hong Kong and Canada have also said they would evacuate passengers.Elsewhere, Japan confirmed three more cases of the virus. This time, they were confirmed in Wakayama, a prefecture in eastern Japan.In the latest indication that the 14-day quarantine simply wasn't enough to kill the virus, a British couple has tested positive for the virus just one day before Japanese authorities are set to release everybody from quarantine, according to the Guardian.\"David and Sally Abel, a British couple onboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan, have tested positive for coronavirus, a day before passengers who tested negative were due to start leaving the ship after spending two weeks in quarantine.\"Including all of the cases announced overnight, there are now 73,336 confirmed cases of the virus worldwide, compared with 1,874 deaths.Johns HopkinsAs the battle against the virus rages in Wuhan, Liu Zhiming, 51, a neurosurgeon and the director of the Wuchang Hospital in Wuhan, became the latest high-profile medical worker to succumb to the virus, as we noted last night. Late last week, China confirmed that nearly 2,000 medical workers had been infected.The Commission overseeing China's virus response has released a statement commemorating Liu's life and honoring his death.\"From the start of the outbreak, Comrade Liu Zhiming, without regard to his personal safety, led the medical staff of Wuchang Hospital at the front lines of the fight against the epidemic,\" the commission said. Dr. Liu \"made significant contributions to our city\u2019s fight to prevent and control the novel coronavirus,\" it added.In Beijing, senior officials including President Xi continued to play down the economic blowback from the virus. During remarks on Tuesday, Xi insisted that China could still meet its 2020 economic targets - which called for a doubling of the size of the Chinese economy in 10 years - despite the outbreak.We cross live to the Chinese Statistics Bureau as President Xi says China can still meet 2020 economic targets despite coronavirus pic.twitter.com/JJeqvbWJCZOf course, China' goalseeked economic data has never offered a truly accurate reflection of the world's second-largest economy. And a report by PitchBook warns that Chinese startups are struggling to raise money as the epidemic complicates deal talks an deals a serious blow to the country's 'venture capital' scene.From the start of the year through Feb. 12, venture capital activity in China fell from 381 to 137 deals, and the capital raised declined from $4.05 billion to $1.37 billion, compared to the same period last year.Prior outbreaks like SARS and swine flu also weighed on investment activity.Moving south to Seoul, South Korean President Moon Jae-in called for South Korea to take \"emergency steps\" to prepare for a more widespread outbreak of COVID-19.In contrast to Xi, Moon warned the coronavirus could have a \"bigger and longer-lasting impact\" on his country's economy than the 2015 MERS outbreak, which prompted South Korea to roll out a supplemental budget while the central bank cut rates, WaPo reports. Speculators are now betting on a rate cut at the Bank of Korea's meeting next week. Singapore also announced on Tuesday that it had earmarked $2.8 billion for virus relief measures to help stabilize its economy and assist workers.Over in the Philippines, 25,000 stranded workers can now return to work.French Health Minister Olivier Veran said Tuesday there was a \"credible risk\" that the virus could transform into a pandemic, Reuters reports.\"This is both a working assumption and a credible risk,\" Veran told France Info radio, when asked about the possibility of the coronavirus spreading globally.Taking a brief break from the news, our disturbing video of the day comes from Xinjiang, the far-flung province that's home to millions of Uyghur Muslims.In this video, shared by the Epoch Times' Jennifer Zeng, a police officer suddenly collapses while walking. His current status is unknown.Zhou Shunxin, a police officer in #Xinjiang, suddenly collaspes while walking.

Authorities are tracking down people with symptoms of fever or those who bought fever and cough medicines since January 20. #COVID2019 #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/6hwEYzymtMAs we reported last night, Apple published a press release admitting it \"does not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided for the March quarter\" due to coronavirus-related issues.Since we haven't reported a full breakdown of cases in a while, here's a complete list and breakdown of infections by country and territory, courtesy of the AP:Mainland China: 1,868 deaths among 72,436 cases, chiefly in Hubei\nHong Kong: 58 cases, 1 death\nMacao: 10\nJapan: 607 cases, including 542 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, 1 death\nSingapore: 77 cases\nThailand: 35\nSouth Korea: 31\nMalaysia: 22\nTaiwan: 22 cases, 1 death\nVietnam: 16 cases\nGermany: 16\nUnited States: 15 cases; separately, 1 US citizen died in China\nAustralia: 14 cases\nFrance: 12 cases, 1 death\nUnited Kingdom: 9 cases\nUnited Arab Emirates: 9\nCanada: 8\nPhilippines: 3 cases, 1 death\nIndia: 3 cases\nItaly: 3\nRussia: 2\nSpain: 2\nBelgium: 1\nNepal: 1\nSri Lanka: 1\nSweden: 1\nCambodia: 1\nFinland: 1\nEgypt: 1In a recent study, China's CCDC found that the virus's fatality rate - 14.8% - is for people aged 80 or older with co-occurring medical conditions. Young and healthy people, meanwhile, typically experience much more mild symptoms, according to the BBC. Along those same lines, the WHO confirmed on Tuesday that the virus manifests as only a minor infection in four out of five people who contract it, according to the Guardian.For everybody still saying that the virus is no more dangerous than the annual flu outbreak, here's some food for thought: An analysis of 44,672 coronavirus patients in China whose diagnoses were confirmed by laboratory testing has found that 1,023 had died by Feb. 11, a fatality rate of 2.3%. That's far higher than the mortality rate for the seasonal flu.Finally, the New York Times has reviewed lockdown conditions across China, and confirmed that more than 760 million people are living in neighborhoods or villages with at least some imposed strictures regulating residents' comings and goings. That represents half of China's population, and one out of every ten people on the planet.Some neighborhoods only require residents to show ID, sign in and have their temperature checked. Other villages prohibit bringing in guests. In places with more stringent restrictions, households are only allowed to send one person out at a time - and often not even every day.Last night, Zeng reported that in some parts of Wuhan the lockdown has become so strict that people aren't allowed to come outside at all.The locking down in #Wuhan is getting tighter. No coming out at all now. #\u6b66\u6c49 \u5c0f\u533a\u5c01\u9501\u52a0\u5267\u3002\u4ece\u4e03\u5929\u53ef\u51fa\u4e00\u6b21\u95e8\u53d8\u4e3a\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u5019\u4e0d\u5f97\u51fa\u95e8\u3002#COVID2019 #Coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #coronaviruschina #\u6b66\u6c49\u80ba\u708e #\u65b0\u51a0\u80ba\u708e #\u65b0\u51a0\u75c5\u6bd2 #\u5c11\u5e74\u8bd1\u5236 pic.twitter.com/kpbNgZAAjjTips: tips@zerohedge.comGeneral: info@zerohedge.comLegal: legal@zerohedge.comAdvertising: Click hereAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.comMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black Helicopters]\" GuideIt would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer, our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure.

Masks are in short supply in the country due to the coronavirus outbreak.Staff at the Japanese Red Cross Kobe Hospital noticed last Thursday that four cartons containing 120 boxes of masks were missing. The hospital notified the police on Monday.Police and hospital officials say the cartons were kept in a third-floor machinery room that's normally locked. No irregularities were found when they were checked on February 3.Hospital officials say that while there are enough masks in stock for the staff, the theft is extremely regrettable.",

            "main_text": "(Adds Chinese entities informed of new rules, no immediate comment from embassy)By Jonathan LandayWASHINGTON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Tuesday said it will begin treating five major Chinese state-run media entities with U.S. operations the same as foreign embassies, requiring them to register their employees and U.S. properties with the State Department.Two senior state department officials said the decision was made because China has been tightening state control over its media and President Xi Jinping has made more aggressive use of them to spread pro-Beijing propaganda.\"The control over both the content and editorial control have only strengthened over the course of Xi Jinping's term in power,\" said one official. \"These guys are in fact arms of the CCP's (Chinese Community Party's) propaganda apparatus.\"The State Department informed the five entities of its decision by letter on Tuesday, the official said. The Chinese embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Beijing's control of China's state-owned media has become \"more and more draconian,\" the second official said.Both officials spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity.Tensions between the two superpowers have escalated since President Donald Trump came to office three years ago, with disputes ranging from trade tariffs to accusations of Chinese spying in the United States and to U.S. support for Taiwan.Tuesday's decision, the officials said, is not linked to any recent developments in Sino-U.S. relations and has been under consideration for some time.The new determination is being applied to the Xinhua News Agency, China Global Television Network, China Radio International, China Daily Distribution Corp. and Hai Tian Development USA, Inc., the officials said.China Daily is an English-language newspaper published by the Chinese Communist Party. Hai Tian Development USA distributes the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the party's Central Committee.The five entities' U.S. operations will have to disclose their personnel rosters and hiring and firing decisions and register properties in the United States that they rent or own with the State Department, the officials said.They also will have to seek advanced approval before they lease or purchase new U.S. properties, they said.One official said that the disclosures would help the State Department better understand how the entities operate in the United States.Asked if there are concerns that Beijing will retaliate against Western media based in China, one official noted that foreign news outlets there already work under strict rules and that the new disclosure rules impose no restrictions on the five state-owned Chinese entities' U.S. operations.\"These guys operate in a far more liberal environment here in the United States than any foreign press enjoy in the People's Republic of China,\" the official said.

Their 14-day mandatory quarantine is now over.\"It is important to know that these people being released from quarantine pose no health risk to the surrounding community or to the communities they will be returning to,\" McDonald said.He added that all the remaining Americans who took U.S.-chartered flights out of Wuhan are expected to complete their own quarantine periods later this week.\"Newly quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers are being kept separate from those individuals who are already at Travis and nearing the end of their quarantine,\" McDonald said, referring to the ship that's been sitting at a cruise ship terminal under a quarantine in Yokohama, Japan.Tuesday's release of Americans from quarantine comes one week after a flight of 195 Americans was freed from quarantine orders at the March Air Reserve Base in Southern California.Quarantined cruise ship to get meals from Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s' charityWorld Central Kitchen, initially created by chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s to help people stricken by natural disasters in the Caribbean, says it has set up a field kitchen in a parking lot near the Diamond Princess cruise ship at Shinko Pier in Yokohama, Japan, where the vessel is nearing the end of a 14-day coronavirus quarantine.The charity is providing food for those on board in a bid to ease the strain on the ship's crew, which has been working to feed passengers, keep the ship clean and perform other duties as the cruise ship sits in isolation at the terminal.The Diamond Princess' captain announced World Central Kitchen's new role in a shipwide address Tuesday, according to passenger Matthew Smith.\"This is to relieve pressure on the crew,\" Smith said via Twitter, adding that he believes the extra help could make it easier for people working on the ship to observe quarantine rules.\"It's definitely a different situation for us,\" World Central Kitchen's Sam Bloch said in a video update about the operation, acknowledging the uncertainty over how long the quarantine might last for some passengers and crew.The food is prepared and cooked in a full kitchen before it's taken to an impromptu kitchen at the terminal, the group says. From there, it gets reheated as needed and delivered to the ship. Bloch, who directs the group's field operations, says the meals are ready to serve when their containers are loaded onto the ship by forklift.\"The crew doesn't have to cook and do all the work,\" Bloch says. \"They get to get some rest.\"Andr\u00e9s said via Twitter that the World Central Kitchen team \"will be there working side by side with everyone on the ground as long as we are needed.\"Before arriving in Japan, Bloch was working in Australia, where World Central Kitchen operates a \"relief kitchen\" to feed firefighters and evacuees. The organization is active in a number of other places, from Puerto Rico and the Bahamas to Venezuela and along the U.S.-Mexico border.Hospital director in Wuhan dies of COVID-19The director of a hospital in Wuhan, China, the center of a deadly coronavirus outbreak, has died from the disease COVID-19, state media reported Tuesday, highlighting the risk that the respiratory virus poses to health professionals.Liu Zhiming, whose age is variously being reported as 50 or 51, was head of the Wuchang Hospital. He was also one of more than 1,700 medical workers confirmed to be infected with the highly contagious virus, according to China Daily. The state news outlet adds that the number of workers dates from last Tuesday \u2014 meaning even more doctors, nurses and other medical staff might now be infected.Outbreak's pace is seen slowing in ChinaMainland China currently has seen more than 70,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to the World Health Organization. And while the country has suffered the majority of deaths associated with the outbreak, health experts in China say there are signs that the pace at which the virus is spreading might be slowing down.As NPR's Emily Feng reports from Beijing:\"Today's numbers from China's national health commission show that the rate at which new cases reported outside Hubei province, where the epidemic has been concentrated, has dropped for two weeks. China's top state epidemiologist said earlier this week that he expected the outbreak to peak sometime in April.\"However, distrust in official state statistics is still high. Hubei in part has the largest share of virus cases in China because it is the only province that discloses so called clinical cases \u2014 symptomatic patients who haven't tested positive for the virus. Other provinces are mandated to collect such data but have not disclosed these types of cases publicly.\"88 more cases on Diamond Princess cruise shipThe Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined at a terminal in Yokohama, Japan, still represents the largest cluster of COVID-19 cases outside China. On Tuesday, Japan's health ministry said tests confirmed 88 more cases \u2014 including 65 people who were identified as asymptomatic pathogen carriers. The diagnoses bring the total number of cases from the ship to 542 out of 2,404 people who have been tested, Japanese officials say.The Diamond Princess had some 3,700 people aboard when it docked in the port south of Tokyo earlier this month. But hundreds of people have since disembarked, either to receive care at local hospitals or, in the case of more than 300 American passengers, to fly back to the U.S. on chartered evacuation flights.\"We walked into the airplane hangar, and there were military people clapping and cheering for us,\" former Diamond Princess passenger Gay Courter told NPR's Morning Edition, describing the scene as she and her husband, Philip, arrived at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. \"And that's when I broke down in tears. It was this overwhelming relief.\"Sixty-one U.S. citizens remain on the Diamond Princess, which is slated to begin emerging from its blanket quarantine on Wednesday. While many passengers will be allowed to leave the ship if they test negative for the new coronavirus, others will have to undergo a longer quarantine if they've been in close contact with anyone who has the COVID-19 disease.Infected U.S. evacuees taken to Omaha, NebraskaAfter the U.S. passengers were taken off the Diamond Princess, 14 of them were revealed to have tested positive for the new coronavirus. U.S. officials say they got the results after the patients had been taken off the ship \u2014 and that all 14 were placed in a special section at the rear of one of the chartered jets because of the possible health risk to other evacuees.The evacuees were flown to Lackland in Texas and Travis Air Force Base in California \u2014 the two designated quarantine spots for Diamond Princess passengers taken to the U.S. But 13 infected evacuees were then flown to Omaha, Nebraska, to receive care at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. It's not clear why the other infected evacuee wasn't among them.\"Those who have tested positive for this novel coronavirus, are only showing mild symptoms of the disease,\" Nebraska Medicine said in a statement.The facility includes a 20-bed national quarantine unit, where 12 of the evacuees are now being monitored. But another evacuee was deemed to need specialized care and was placed in a biocontainment unit.The University of Nebraska Medical Center runs the national Training, Simulation and Quarantine Center, which it says has \"the nation's only federal quarantine unit and simulated biocontainment units for advanced experiential training.\"The center has been involved in combating other dangerous outbreaks in recent years, including the Ebola virus outbreak that started in 2014.",

            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.The World Health Organization's (WHO's) online Ebola dashboard shows a case count of 3,433 today, with a single newly confirmed case. The death toll is now 2,249 in an outbreak that has lasted 18 months in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).The WHO said 334 suspected cases are currently under investigation. According to the latest weekly report from the WHO's African regional office, only one case has been reported in the past week, from Beni. In the past 3 weeks, 11 cases have been recorded.\"Beni remains the main hotspot for the continuing EVD outbreak as the number of new cases keep lowering,\" the WHO said. \"While there is room for cautious optimism around the decline in new confirmed cases, continued access and heightened vigilance is required to maintain case investigation and contact tracing activities in all health zones.\"Beni has reported 90% of cases in the past 21 days. WHO Ebola dashboard  Feb 17 WHO African regional office reportThe WHO's African regional office also said that both Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR) are in the midst of measles outbreaks, with both countries reporting increasing case counts since the first of the year.In Chad, 1,276 cases, including 14 deaths have been reported since Jan 1, with 352 suspected measles cases and 4 deaths reported in the week ending on Feb 9.\"Most, 78%, of the investigated cases never received any vaccination against measles,\" the WHO said. \"Sixty percent of the investigated cases were under five years of age while 19% were between 5 and 14 years and 14% were 15 years and above.\"In CAR, a total of 1,498 suspected measles cases, including 15 deaths, have been recorded since the first of the year. The outbreak has been ongoing since early 2019. From Jan 1, 2019, through Feb 9, 2020, a total of 5,724 suspected measles cases, including 83 deaths (case-fatality rate, 1.45%) have been reported in 13 health districts.Almost three fourths of the cases (72%) are in children under the age of 5. Feb 17 WHO African regional office reportIn a global flu update yesterday, the WHO noted high activity across the Northern Hemisphere, though some European countries seemed to have reached their seasonal peak.Globally, 59% of detections are influenza A, and of subtyped flu A viruses, about 76% were 2009 H1N1. Of characterized B viruses, 98.5% belonged to the B-Victoria lineage.Both Canada and the United States still have elevated levels of flu, with a strong showing from influenza B. Mexico reported increased activity due to influenza A H1N1. Some countries in Northern and Eastern Europe reported increasing flu detections, but Ireland and the United Kingdom reported a decrease in activity.In China, the WHO said, \"ILI activity increased once again after a slight decrease reported in recent weeks and was at a greater level than the activity recorded during the same time period in the three previous seasons.\"In Central America and the Caribbean, flu detections were low.

            "main_text": "University of Minnesota. Driven to Discover.CARB-X said today it has awarded Lytica Therapeutics, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, up to $5.3 million to develop antibacterial peptides that have broad activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria for treating lung and other infections.In a news release, CARB-X (the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator) said Lytica could receive up to $11.6 million in additional funding if the project achieves certain development milestones, for a potential total of $16.9 million.\"There is an urgent need for innovative therapeutics and approaches to drug-resistant infections that, today, are killing some 700,000 people around the world each year,\" said Erin Duffy, PhD, chief of research and development at CARB-X. \"The Lytica project is in the early phases of development, but if successful and ultimately approved for use in patients, it could represent tremendous improvement in the treatment of multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens.\"Antimicrobial peptides are a family of peptides with therapeutic potential, but their clinical use is limited mostly to topical applications because of problems with toxicity, stability, and efficacy. Lytica's proprietary \"stapling\" technology aims to overcome these hurdles.The company has produced compounds called stapled antimicrobial peptides that have demonstrated potent activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria, stability against degrading, and wide therapeutic potential. If successful, the project could produce treatments for a wide range of serious infections, including lung, urinary tract, and intra-abdominal infections.Since its launch in 2016, CARB-X, a public-private partnership, has announced 57 awards exceeding $193 million, with additional funds possible if project milestones are met. Its goal is to invest $500 million by the end of 2021.Feb 18 CARB-X news releaseIn a report today on airborne antimicrobial resistance, the UK Environment Agency says much more research is needed to determine how much of a health risk it poses.The review and analysis of 88 relevant papers obtained from three academic databases found that, despite differences in study environments, methods used, and antibiotics studied, some basic conclusions emerged. Among those conclusions are that tetracycline resistance appears to be more prevalent in agriculturally associated air, industrial activities involving fecal matter (including farms) are associated with the highest levels of multidrug resistance reported to date, and the ubiquitous use of azole antifungals in medicine and agriculture\u2014along with the ability of fungi to travel long distances in the air\u2014makes airborne antifungal resistance a relevant threat.Some of the questions that still need to be addressed, according to the report, are whether air is a primary route of antimicrobial resistance transmission to humans and other vulnerable hosts, and how the resulting risk compares with other transmission methods. The researchers say exploring the biophysics of airborne antimicrobial resistance could help answer some of these questions.\"More research is recommended to close knowledge gaps and test emergent hypotheses,\" the authors of the report write. \"Also needed is a more concerted effort to report and share the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing in a standardised way, and more careful and standardised collection and reporting of air sampling.\" Feb 18 UK Environment Agency reportAn analysis of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates collected from young children in primary care settings has found reduced susceptibility to several antibiotic classes in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) era, researchers report today in Clinical Infectious Diseases.In the prospective cohort study, investigators from Rochester General Hospital Research Institute in Rochester, New York, collected nasopharyngeal and middle ear fluid samples from children ages 6 to 36 months during acute otitis media (ear infection) and routine healthy visits at primary care pediatric practices in Rochester from 2006 through 2016. They then performed antibiotic susceptibility testing on S pneumoniae isolates against a panel of 16 antibiotics from 10 classes. All children were up to date on vaccines, receiving the PCV-7 vaccine from 2006 until April 2010 and PCV-13 after April 2010.From 2006 through 2016, 1,201 S pneumoniae isolates were characterized from 1,072 visits of 448 children. Analysis of susceptibility trends showed that, after introduction of PCV-13, susceptibility to S pneumoniae to antibiotics, especially penicillin, initially improved, largely because of the disappearance of serotype 19A, which is included in PCV-13. But beginning in 2013, antibiotic susceptibility among S pneumoniae strains began decreasing with the emergence of three serotypes (11A, 35B, and 35F) not included in PCV-13. In addition to reduced susceptibility to penicillin, the most recent isolates also showed reduced susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and carbapenems.The authors of the study say the reduced susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and carbapenems could have implications for future treatment of invasive pneumococcal disease. They also note that neither of the two PCVs in advanced development (PCV-15 and PCV-20) includes serotypes 35B or 35F.Feb 18 Clin Infect Dis abstractGet CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now\u00bbUnrestricted financial support provided byGrant support for ASP provided byBecome an underwriter\u00bbCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

Chance of rain 40%.Updated: March 15, 2020 @ 12:06 amMarshfield High School.Marshfield High School.COOS BAY \u2014 A 16-year-old from Marshfield High School passed away due to complications of Influenza B.According to a press release from the Coos Bay School District on Feb. 17, the student died early Monday morning.\u201cWe drafted talking points to share with staff today to talk with their first period students, letting them know the facts and that they aren\u2019t in danger of being at school,\" said Travis Howard, principal at MHS.The school district\u2019s crisis team met on Monday at 3 p.m. for three hours to discuss how to support staff and students affected by the student\u2019s death. Howard said they developed not only talking points for students, but correspondence for parents. Monday evening, Howard sent out a robocall to parents letting them know a student passed due to flu-like symptoms.This morning, Howard said that a safe room has been set up for students at the school who might need counseling.\u201cWe have two substitute teachers on site today to help support teachers who are dealing with this situation as well,\u201d Howard said, adding that counselors will be on site for most of the week. \u201cYou can plan for these types of things but until we see the amount of grieving and support students need, you just don\u2019t know.\u201dHoward told The World early Tuesday morning that the students seemed to be handling the news well so far. Administrators and support staff walked the halls to touch base with students before class.\u201cThe student was a football and baseball player and he was also in the band,\u201d Howard said, explaining that the school has already reached out to those groups and will provide additional support to both the student\u2019s advisory class and band class. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to wrap our arms around everybody ... Anytime the Marshfield family is met with tragedy, it is heartbreaking but I can\u2019t thank the crisis team and support staff enough for coming together on a holiday and coming up with a supportive plan for staff and students.\u201dThis story will be updated as more information is made available.Reporter Jillian Ward can be reached at 541-269-1222, ext. 235, or by email at jillian.ward@theworldlink.com.

The people will be monitored by county health officials for the 14 days since they departed from the locations affected by coronavirus, Amler said.Authorities declined to disclose the locations of the people being quarantined in Westchester, citing privacy concerns.A Centers for Disease Control representative is seen aboard a 737 cargo plane evacuating passengers who were quarantined on a cruise ship in Japan.\u00a0(Photo: Courtesy of Sommer Gunia)The reports come as\u00a0Chinese officials released\u00a0data Tuesday indicating the new virus could be 20 times more lethal than the flu.The\u00a0global coronavirus death toll hit\u00a01,875, with all\u00a0but a handful of the fatalities in China.\u00a0Total infections rose Tuesday to more than 73,000, all but a few hundred in China.\u00a0There had been 29 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S.New York state has seen 25 total cases of potential coroanvirus return negative test results, including 19\u00a0outside of New York City, according to the latest state data released Tuesday.

            "main_text": "The number of cases in Japan stands at more than 500 as of writing, including 454 from a quarantined cruise ship docked near Tokyo.Anxiety surrounding the virus has been palpable for weeks, with citizens throughout the country wearing face masks and carrying alcoholic disinfectant. But the concern reached new levels on Monday, after news broke of a health ministry official testing positive. The man, who is in his 50s, had been working on the quarantined cruise ship, reportedly helping control traffic as infected passengers disembarked. Worryingly, he was infected despite only working for about 10 minutes and maintaining a distance of at least two meters from the passengers.On Monday, the health ministry announced a directive instructing all municipalities to expand screenings to include people with symptoms who have not traveled to the Chinese provinces of Hubei and Zhejiang. Hubei is the epicenter of the outbreak, and has close business links with Zhejiang.The measure comes after infections were confirmed among people who had neither been to the provinces nor come into contact with people who had.Laboratories, quarantine stations, universities, and companies around the country are now increasing their personnel in an effort to meet the new testing requirements. The health ministry says the expanded manpower will enable screening of an additional 1,050 people a day.The ministry says it will also provide medical institutions that have adequate screening equipment with the chemicals and materials needed to conduct testing.The ministry also announced a set of standards to help people decide when to seek medical assistance:Additionally, ministry officials are urging people to stay home from school or work if they display any symptoms of the cold.Health experts are working around the clock on treatment. While it will be some time before a vaccine is available for widespread use, there are signs that one already existing drug may be effective at combating the virus.The director of Disease Control and Prevention Center, Norio Omagari, told NHK World that a team of researchers from his organization is conducting clinical trials on a drug commonly used to treat HIV. Omagari says that some patients have recovered after the tests, adding that his team is expediting the process to verify the effectiveness of the treatment.The outbreak is affecting a wide range of activities in business and culture.Japan's Imperial Household Agency has canceled Emperor Naruhito's public birthday greetings, which were schedule for February 23. The event would have marked the emperor's first birthday since ascending to the throne and thousands were expected to attend. It is the first imperial birthday greeting to be called off since 1996, when there was a hostage crisis at the Japanese embassy in Peru.On the business side, Japanese companies with operations in Hubei Province and other parts of China have been struggling to maintain production. The full extent of the impact of the outbreak is difficult to assess but experts say it will prove to be a major setback for the global economy.",

            "main_text": "The effect of anesthetic techniques on cancer recurrence has been the subject of intensive research in the past years, as it affects a large proportion of the population. The use of opioids and halogenated agents in cancer patients during the perioperative period may be related to higher rates of cancer recurrence and reduced disease-free survival.This was a prospective study. The sample was composed of 100 patients who underwent a radical cystectomy for infiltrating bladder cancer in a reference center. We compared disease-free survival associated with combined anesthesia versus opiate-based analgesia. The relationship between the administered hypnotic and disease-free survival was also investigated.The median disease-free survival of the patients who received combined anesthesia was 585 (240-1,005) days versus 210 (90-645) days in the other group. A significant difference was observed between the two groups (p = 0.01). Combined analysis of all groups revealed significant differences in disease-free survival between patients who received combined anesthesia with propofol (510 [315-1,545] disease-free days) and those who received sevoflurane and opioids (150 [90-450] disease-free days) (p = 0.02).Anesthesia may play a crucial role in tumor relapse, as it is administered at the moment of the greatest risk of dissemination: surgical handling of the tumor. Opioids and volatile agents have been related to an increased risk for cancer recurrence. We compared the use of propofol + local anesthesia versus sevoflurane + opioids and also found that disease-free survival was longer among patients who received propofol + local anesthesia. Disease-free survival increases with the use of propofol in combination with epidural anesthesia in patients who undergo surgery for infiltrating bladder cancer.Oncology. 2020 Jan 21 [Epub ahead of print]Jose Luis Guerrero Orriach, Aida Raigon Ponferrada, Alfredo Malo Manso, Bernardo Herrera Imbroda, Juan Jose Escalona Belmonte, Marta Ramirez Aliaga, Alicia Ramirez Fernandez, Julia Diaz Crespo, Angela M Soriano Perez, Ana Fontaneda Heredia, Maria Emilia Dominguez Recio, Manuel Rubio Navarro, Jose Cruz Ma\u00f1asInstitute of Biomedical Research in Malaga (IBIMA), Malaga, Spain, emailProtector.addCloakedMailto(\"ep_6d4dd3ed\", 0);., Department of Anesthesiology, Virgen de la Victoria University Hospital, Malaga, Spain., Institute of Biomedical Research in Malaga (IBIMA), Malaga, Spain., Department of Anesthesiology, Complejo Hospitalario de Ja\u00e9n, Ja\u00e9n, Spain., Department of Oncology, Virgen de la Victoria University Hospital, Malaga, Spain.PubMed http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31962315COPYRIGHT \u00a9 2002 - 2020 DIGITAL SCIENCE PRESS, INC.Login to update email address, newsletter preferences and use bookmarks.EmailPassword",

            "main_text": "A cruise ship, named the Diamond Princess, had travel that originated in Yokohama on 20 January and included stops in Japan (Kagoshima), Hong Kong, Vietnam, Taiwan and Japan (Okinawa), before arriving back in Yokohama on 3 February. During this time, a passenger who disembarked on 25 January in Hong Kong, has presented with cough since 19\u00a023 Jan and was confirmed positive for Novel coronavirus on 1 February. The Japanese government requested that the Diamond Princess stay at port, with no passengers or crew disembarking, in Yokohama when it arrived on 3 February. During 3-4 February, health status of all passengers and crew members were checked by questionnaire by quarantine officers, and respiratory specimens were taken from symptomatic passengers, crew, and their close contacts to test for Novel coronavirus. On 5 February, a lab-confirmed case of COVID-19 led to the quarantine of the Diamond Princess for 14 days beginning at 7am, with passengers requested to stay in their cabins. As of 5 February, there was a total of 3711 individuals on board the Diamond Princess, with 2666 passengers and 1045 crew members.At the beginning of the quarantine period, crew members were provided with personal protective equipment (PPE) and instructed on appropriate IPC practices. On 7 February, passengers were provided thermometers for self-monitoring of body temperature, with instructions on calling a \u201cFever Call Center\u201d, if they had a fever above 37.5C. Passengers who developed fever were referred to the medical team in charge and were tested for Novel coronavirus. Passengers who developed serious illness, including non-COVID-19 morbidities, were referred the ship\u2019s Medical Center, which provided essential health services. Those passengers with lab-confirmed COVID-19 were disembarked and transferred to an isolation ward at healthcare facilities. Their cabinmates were defined as \u201cclose contacts\u201d and were therefore tested. If positive, they were also confirmed as a case and disembarked to a healthcare facility. If they tested negative, they remained on board but with a 14-day quarantine period reset after the last contact with the confirmed case. All crew and healthcare staff onboard the Diamond Princess were instructed to follow international guidance on infection prevention and control. To maintain operations of the ship, some crew continued to perform essential, limited services while the ship remained in quarantine. This led to those crew members not remaining fully isolated, in the same manner as passengers, during the quarantine period.Initially, only symptomatic cases and close contacts were being tested for COVID-19. This was changed on 11 February, due to the expansion of laboratory capacity, with quarantine officers systematically collecting respiratory specimens from all passengers by age group, starting with those 80 years old and older as well as individuals with co-morbidities, such as diabetes or a heart condition. Respiratory specimens collected were tested via PCR for confirmation of Novel coronavirus. Epidemiological data collected was initially limited due to the emergency nature of the quarantine and included data on onset of symptoms, date of lab confirmation, and close contacts. A confirmed case of COVID-19, for this report, is anyone, passenger or crew, who had a positive PCR test for Novel coronavirus, independent of their symptom presentation. In most cases, the \u201cpopulation on board,\u201d refers to the 3,711 passenger and crew aboard Diamond Princess on 5 February.As of 18 February, there have been 531 confirmed cases (14.3% of all individuals on board on 5 February), including 65 crew and 466 passengers. A total 2404 respiratory specimens were tested, and 542 were positive (22.5), including double tests. Among confirmed COVID-19 cases with recorded symptom onset (n=184), there were 33 (18%) with onset dates before 6 February, which was the first full day of quarantine, and 151 (82%) with onset dates on or after the 6th. A total 255 (48%) of the confirmed cases were asymptomatic when the respiratory specimen was collected. Of these, 8 were crew and 247 were passengers. (Information on development of symptoms after disembarkation of asymptomatic confirmed cases is not currently available.) A total 23 passengers with reported onset dates were confirmed after another passenger in the same cabin had been confirmed. From 13 February to now, 81% of cases among confirmed passengers or crew with reported onset dates (n=22) occurred in crew (n=13) or passengers from cabins with a previously confirmed case (n=5).Based on the number of confirmed cases by onset date, there is clear evidence that substantial transmission of COVID-19 had been occurring prior to implementation of quarantine on the Diamond Princess on 5 February (see also febrile patient visits to the on-board clinic below). The decline in the number of confirmed cases, based on reported onset dates, implies that the quarantine intervention was effective in reducing transmission among passengers. Transmission toward the end of the quarantine period, which is scheduled to end for most passengers on 19 Feb, appears to have occurred mostly among crew or within passenger cabins. It should be noted that due to the nature of the ship, individual isolation of all those aboard was not possible. Sharing of cabins was necessary, and some crew had to continue to perform essential duties for the functioning of the vessel with passengers aboard.Recent confirmations of asymptomatic cases can be explained by the systematic testing of passengers that began around 14 Feb. Although some of these cases may have been secondary cases within a given cabin, it is difficult to know when transmission occurred. They may have been infected before the quarantine began. Nevertheless, these asymptomatic cases have been disembarked and their cabinmates have been defined as close contacts with their 14-day isolation reset on the day the asymptomatic case was disembarked. The systematic testing of asymptomatic cases was useful in screening these persons before allowing them to disembark.Those persons (mostly passengers) who have completed the 14-day quarantine, have not tested positive, and pass a medical check on the 14th day, will be disembarked on the 19th.Those individuals who were in contact with a confirmed case will be put in isolation until they complete the 14-day period beginning after the last day of their suspected contact with a case. This includes a large proportion of the crew members of the Diamond Princess. The crew performed essential tasks that allowed the quarantine to occur successfully for 14 days and should be appreciated for their service.As the persons aboard were exposed to a high-risk environment for a prolonged period, all persons who disembark should be careful about the health conditions for the time being and immediately report to a public health center if they develop symptoms.Percent of persons aboard who were confirmed with COVID-19 by age group and symptom status at the time of specimen collection.Age groupSymptomatic confirmed cases (%)Asymptomatic confirmed cases (%)Total confirmed cases (%)Persons aboard on 5 February00-090(0)1(6)1(6)1610-191(4)1(4)2(9)2320-2918(5)2(1)20(6)34730-3918(4)5(1)23(5)42940-4918(5)7(2)25(8)33350-5927(7)22(6)49(12)39860-6973(8)56(6)129(14)92470-7992(9)136(13)228(22)101580-8927(13)25(12)52(24)21590-992(18)0(0)2(18)11Total276(7)255(7)531(14)3711Number of confirmed COVID-19 cases with reported onset dates, by onset date, aboard Diamond Princess, 6 \u2013 17 February 2020 (n=151)Febrile Patients, by date of clinic visit, Diamond Princess clinic, 19 Jan - 2 Feb 2020 (n=79)Characteristics of COVID-19 Cases with reported on-set dates of 6 \u2013 17 Feb 2020 (n=151)*.Date of Onset (n cases)CrewPassengersPassengers from cabins with another confirmed case (%)17 Feb (0)00016 Feb (0)00015 Feb (1)10014 Feb (5)411 (100%) [0]13 Feb (16)884 (50%) [2]12 Feb (12)750 (00%) [2]11 Feb (18)7113 (27%) [1]10 Feb (10)373 (43%) [1]9 Feb (24)5196 (32%) [9]8 Feb (18)2161 (6%) [3]7 Feb (31)2294 (14%) [10]6 Feb (16)1151 (7%) [6]Total4011123 (21%) [34]*\u00a0The total number of cases in this table (n=151) is the total number of cases with known onset dates.Note, the number in brackets represents the number of additional confirmed cases in the same cabin with unknown onset date.Copyright 1998 National Institute of Infectious Diseases, JapanTop\nDesktop version",

The novel coronavirus is a new virus and part of a large group of viruses that infect people and while normally causing a mild respiratory disease - such as the common cold - it can potentially be deadly. Signs and symptoms of this coronavirus illness include fever, cold spells, cough, difficulty breathing, chills and muscle pains. Be advised that this is cold and flu season, and the coronavirus shares similar symptoms to both these illnesses.Preventive Measure Tips/Guidelines:Visit the following sites for the most updated information:*** USFK Novel Coronavirus 24 hour hotline at BDAACH: 050.3337.2566 (mobile to DSN); 737.2556 (DSN) ***- USFK Self-Quarantine Frequently Asked Questions\u00a0(USFK FAQs)- Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC)- U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)- U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Coronavirus FAQs (CDC FAQs)- U.S. Embassy Seoul COVID-19 Travel Alerts and Information- DoD Novel Coronavirus Resources Site- Novel Coronavirus Interactive Display Map and DemographicsArchived Updates:South Korea has reported the COVID-19 virus has been confirmed in 17 major provinces and cities, including Seoul, Daegu, Busan, Chinhae and now Pyeongtaek - all cities that are near USFK military bases - and has raised the virus alert level to \"serious,\" the highest in their four-tier system.The following Pyeongtaek locations are off-limits as they were known visitation spots of the confirmed patient: Champon Time Restaurant (\uc9ec\ubf55\ud0c0\uc784), McDonald\u2019s Pyeongtaek SK Branch(\ub9e5\ub3c4\ub0a0\ub4dc\ud3c9\ud0ddSK\uc810), Hyundai Hyangchon Mart(\ud604\ub300 \ud5a5\ucd0c\ub9c8\ud2b8), Nogaldae Potato Soup Restaurant(\ub178\uac78\ub300\uac10\uc790\ud0d5\uacbd\uae30\ud3c9\ud0dd\uc810) and Hill & Top Sports Climbing(\ud790\uc564\ud1a0\ud074\ub77c\uc774\ubc0d).As previous stated, USFK has implemented strong preventative control measures, and wants to ensure everyone is doing their part to help control the virus spread:Follow and practice strict hygiene procedures including wash hands often with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available, avoid touching your face or eyes with unwashed hands, cough or sneeze into your sleeve or elbow and not hands, avoid handshaking, clean frequently used common areas, and most importantly, if you are feeling sick or ill, stay home - do not go to work or school - avoid exposure with others and seek medical treatment.February 19, 2020:February 2, 2020:February 1, 2020:",

The ship was berthed, and boarded by medics, alerted understood, in advance, on presence of two sick crew, with virus-like symptoms of fever and flu. 2 sick seamen were isolated and checked, both tested coronavirus positive. They\u2019ve been taken to hospital, the rest of the crew are isolated in superstructure, the ship is fenced off at shore side, so that no docker or other port personnel would mistakenly blunder in and approach the ship.

The virus binds to host cells through its trimeric spike glycoprotein, making this protein a key target for potential therapies and diagnostics. Wrapp et al. determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution structure of the 2019-nCoV trimeric spike protein by cryo\u2013electron microscopy. Using biophysical assays, the authors show that this protein binds at least 10 times more tightly than the corresponding spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2013CoV to their common host cell receptor. They also tested three antibodies known to bind to the SARS-CoV spike protein but did not detect binding to the 2019-nCoV spike protein. These studies provide valuable information to guide the development of medical counter-measures for 2019-nCoV.Science, this issue p. 1260The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) represents a pandemic threat that has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure development, we determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also provide biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with higher affinity than does severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV S. Additionally, we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019-nCoV S, suggesting that antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two RBDs. The structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable the rapid development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to address the ongoing public health crisis.The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has recently emerged as a human pathogen in the city of Wuhan in China\u2019s Hubei province, causing fever, severe respiratory illness, and pneumonia\u2014a disease recently named COVID-19 (1, 2). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 16 February 2020, there had been >51,000 confirmed cases globally, leading to at least 1600 deaths. The emerging pathogen was rapidly characterized as a new member of the betacoronavirus genus, closely related to several bat coronaviruses and to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (3, 4). Compared with SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV appears to be more readily transmitted from human to human, spreading to multiple continents and leading to the WHO\u2019s declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 (1, 5, 6).2019-nCoV makes use of a densely glycosylated spike (S) protein to gain entry into host cells. The S protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein that exists in a metastable prefusion conformation that undergoes a substantial structural rearrangement to fuse the viral membrane with the host cell membrane (7, 8). This process is triggered when the S1 subunit binds to a host cell receptor. Receptor binding destabilizes the prefusion trimer, resulting in shedding of the S1 subunit and transition of the S2 subunit to a stable postfusion conformation (9). To engage a host cell receptor, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 undergoes hinge-like conformational movements that transiently hide or expose the determinants of receptor binding. These two states are referred to as the \u201cdown\u201d conformation and the \u201cup\u201d conformation, where down corresponds to the receptor-inaccessible state and up corresponds to the receptor-accessible state, which is thought to be less stable (10\u201313). Because of the indispensable function of the S protein, it represents a target for antibody-mediated neutralization, and characterization of the prefusion S structure would provide atomic-level information to guide vaccine design and development.Based on the first reported genome sequence of 2019-nCoV (4), we expressed ectodomain residues 1 to 1208 of 2019-nCoV S, adding two stabilizing proline mutations in the C-terminal S2 fusion machinery using a previous stabilization strategy that proved effective for other betacoronavirus S proteins (11, 14). Figure 1A shows the domain organization of the expression construct, and figure S1 shows the purification process. We obtained ~0.5 mg/liter of the recombinant prefusion-stabilized S ectodomain from FreeStyle 293 cells and purified the protein to homogeneity by affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography (fig. S1). Cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM) grids were prepared using this purified, fully glycosylated S protein, and preliminary screening revealed a high particle density with little aggregation near the edges of the holes.(A) Schematic of 2019-nCoV S primary structure colored by domain. Domains that were excluded from the ectodomain expression construct or could not be visualized in the final map are colored white. SS, signal sequence; S2\u2032, S2\u2032 protease cleavage site; FP, fusion peptide; HR1, heptad repeat 1; CH, central helix; CD, connector domain; HR2, heptad repeat 2; TM, transmembrane domain; CT, cytoplasmic tail. Arrows denote protease cleavage sites. (B) Side and top views of the prefusion structure of the 2019-nCoV S protein with a single RBD in the up conformation. The two RBD down protomers are shown as cryo-EM density in either white or gray and the RBD up protomer is shown in ribbons colored corresponding to the schematic in (A).After collecting and processing 3207 micrograph movies, we obtained a 3.5-\u00c5-resolution three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of an asymmetrical trimer in which a single RBD was observed in the up conformation. (Fig. 1B, fig. S2, and table S1). Because of the small size of the RBD (~21 kDa), the asymmetry of this conformation was not readily apparent until ab initio 3D reconstruction and classification were performed (Fig. 1B and fig. S3). By using the 3D variability feature in cryoSPARC v2 (15), we observed breathing of the S1 subunits as the RBD underwent a hinge-like movement, which likely contributed to the relatively poor local resolution of S1 compared with the more stable S2 subunit (movies S1 and S2). This seemingly stochastic RBD movement has been captured during structural characterization of the closely related betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as the more distantly related alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (10, 11, 13, 16). The observation of this phenomenon in 2019-nCoV S suggests that it shares the same mechanism of triggering that is thought to be conserved among the Coronaviridae, wherein receptor binding to exposed RBDs leads to an unstable three-RBD up conformation that results in shedding of S1 and refolding of S2 (11, 12).Because the S2 subunit appeared to be a symmetric trimer, we performed a 3D refinement imposing C3 symmetry, resulting in a 3.2-\u00c5-resolution map with excellent density for the S2 subunit. Using both maps, we built most of the 2019-nCoV S ectodomain, including glycans at 44 of the 66 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimer (fig. S4). Our final model spans S residues 27 to 1146, with several flexible loops omitted. Like all previously reported coronavirus S ectodomain structures, the density for 2019-nCoV S begins to fade after the connector domain, reflecting the flexibility of the heptad repeat 2 domain in the prefusion conformation (fig. S4A) (13, 16\u201318).The overall structure of 2019-nCoV S resembles that of SARS-CoV S, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 3.8 \u00c5 over 959 C\u03b1 atoms (Fig. 2A). One of the larger differences between these two structures (although still relatively minor) is the position of the RBDs in their respective down conformations. Whereas the SARS-CoV RBD in the down conformation packs tightly against the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the neighboring protomer, the 2019-nCoV RBD in the down conformation is angled closer to the central cavity of the trimer (Fig. 2B). Despite this observed conformational difference, when the individual structural domains of 2019-nCoV S are aligned to their counterparts from SARS-CoV S, they reflect the high degree of structural homology between the two proteins, with the NTDs, RBDs, subdomains 1 and 2 (SD1 and SD2), and S2 subunits yielding individual RMSD values of 2.6 \u00c5, 3.0 \u00c5, 2.7 \u00c5, and 2.0 \u00c5, respectively (Fig. 2C).(A) Single protomer of 2019-nCoV S with the RBD in the down conformation (left) is shown in ribbons colored according to Fig. 1. A protomer of 2019-nCoV S in the RBD up conformation is shown (center) next to a protomer of SARS-CoV S in the RBD up conformation (right), displayed as ribbons and colored white (PDB ID: 6CRZ). (B) RBDs of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV aligned based on the position of the adjacent NTD from the neighboring protomer. The 2019-nCoV RBD is colored green and the SARS-CoV RBD is colored white. The 2019-nCoV NTD is colored blue. (C) Structural domains from 2019-nCoV S have been aligned to their counterparts from SARS-CoV S as follows: NTD (top left), RBD (top right), SD1 and SD2 (bottom left), and S2 (bottom right).2019-nCoV S shares 98% sequence identity with the S protein from the bat coronavirus RaTG13, with the most notable variation arising from an insertion in the S1/S2 protease cleavage site that results in an \u201cRRAR\u201d furin recognition site in 2019-nCoV (19) rather than the single arginine in SARS-CoV (fig. S5) (20\u201323). Notably, amino acid insertions that create a polybasic furin site in a related position in hemagglutinin proteins are often found in highly virulent avian and human influenza viruses (24). In the structure reported here, the S1/S2 junction is in a disordered, solvent-exposed loop. In addition to this insertion of residues in the S1/S2 junction, 29 variant residues exist between 2019-nCoV S and RaTG13 S, with 17 of these positions mapping to the RBD (figs. S5 and S6). We also analyzed the 61 available 2019-nCoV S sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and found that there were only nine amino acid substitutions among all deposited sequences. Most of these substitutions are relatively conservative and are not expected to have a substantial effect on the structure or function of the 2019-nCoV S protein (fig. S6).Recent reports demonstrating that 2019-nCoV S and SARS-CoV S share the same functional host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (22, 25\u201327), prompted us to quantify the kinetics of this interaction by surface plasmon resonance. ACE2 bound to the 2019-nCoV S ectodomain with ~15 nM affinity, which is ~10- to 20-fold higher than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S (Fig. 3A and fig. S7) (14). We also formed a complex of ACE2 bound to the 2019-nCoV S ectodomain and observed it by negative-stain EM, which showed that it strongly resembled the complex formed between SARS-CoV S and ACE2 that has been observed at high resolution by cryo-EM (Fig. 3B) (14, 28). The high affinity of 2019-nCoV S for human ACE2 may contribute to the apparent ease with which 2019-nCoV can spread from human to human (1); however, additional studies are needed to investigate this possibility.(A) Surface plasmon resonance sensorgram showing the binding kinetics for human ACE2 and immobilized 2019-nCoV S. Data are shown as black lines, and the best fit of the data to a 1:1 binding model is shown in red. (B) Negative-stain EM 2D class averages of 2019-nCoV S bound by ACE2. Averages have been rotated so that ACE2 is positioned above the 2019-nCoV S protein with respect to the viral membrane. A diagram depicting the ACE2-bound 2019-nCoV S protein is shown (right) with ACE2 in blue and S protein protomers colored tan, pink, and green.The overall structural homology and shared receptor usage between SARS-CoV S and 2019-nCoV S prompted us to test published SARS-CoV RBD-directed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for cross-reactivity to the 2019-nCoV RBD (Fig. 4A). A 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1 fragment (S residues 319 to 591) was recombinantly expressed, and appropriate folding of this construct was validated by measuring ACE2 binding using biolayer interferometry (BLI) (Fig. 4B). Cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV RBD-directed mAbs S230, m396, and 80R was then evaluated by BLI (12, 29\u201331). Despite the relatively high degree of structural homology between the 2019-nCoV RBD and the SARS-CoV RBD, no binding to the 2019-nCoV RBD could be detected for any of the three mAbs at the concentration tested (1 \u03bcM) (Fig. 4C), in contrast to the strong binding that we observed to the SARS-CoV RBD (fig. S8). Although the epitopes of these three antibodies represent a relatively small percentage of the surface area of the 2019-nCoV RBD, the lack of observed binding suggests that SARS-directed mAbs will not necessarily be cross-reactive and that future antibody isolation and therapeutic design efforts will benefit from using 2019-nCoV S proteins as probes.(A) SARS-CoV RBD shown as a white molecular surface (PDB ID: 2AJF), with residues that vary in the 2019-nCoV RBD colored red. The ACE2-binding site is outlined with a black dashed line. (B) Biolayer interferometry sensorgram showing binding to ACE2 by the 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1. Binding data are shown as a black line, and the best fit of the data to a 1:1 binding model is shown in red. (C) Biolayer interferometry to measure cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV RBD-directed antibodies S230, m396, and 80R. Sensor tips with immobilized antibodies were dipped into wells containing 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1, and the resulting data are shown as a black line.The rapid global spread of 2019-nCoV, which prompted the PHEIC declaration by WHO, signals the urgent need for coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics. Knowing the atomic-level structure of the 2019-nCoV spike will allow for additional protein-engineering efforts that could improve antigenicity and protein expression for vaccine development. The structural data will also facilitate the evaluation of 2019-nCoV spike mutations that will occur as the virus undergoes genetic drift and help to define whether those residues have surface exposure and map to sites of known antibody epitopes for other coronavirus spike proteins.

Wrapp et al. determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution structure of the 2019-nCoV trimeric spike protein by cryo\u2013electron microscopy. Using biophysical assays, the authors show that this protein binds at least 10 times more tightly than the corresponding spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2013CoV to their common host cell receptor. They also tested three antibodies known to bind to the SARS-CoV spike protein but did not detect binding to the 2019-nCoV spike protein.

The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure development, we determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also provide biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with higher affinity than does severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV S. Additionally, we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019-nCoV S, suggesting that antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two RBDs. The structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable the rapid development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to address the ongoing public health crisis.The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has recently emerged as a human pathogen in the city of Wuhan in China\u2019s Hubei province, causing fever, severe respiratory illness, and pneumonia\u2014a disease recently named COVID-19 (1, 2). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 16 February 2020, there had been >51,000 confirmed cases globally, leading to at least 1600 deaths. The emerging pathogen was rapidly characterized as a new member of the betacoronavirus genus, closely related to several bat coronaviruses and to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (3, 4). Compared with SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV appears to be more readily transmitted from human to human, spreading to multiple continents and leading to the WHO\u2019s declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 (1, 5, 6).2019-nCoV makes use of a densely glycosylated spike (S) protein to gain entry into host cells. The S protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein that exists in a metastable prefusion conformation that undergoes a substantial structural rearrangement to fuse the viral membrane with the host cell membrane (7, 8). This process is triggered when the S1 subunit binds to a host cell receptor. Receptor binding destabilizes the prefusion trimer, resulting in shedding of the S1 subunit and transition of the S2 subunit to a stable postfusion conformation (9). To engage a host cell receptor, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 undergoes hinge-like conformational movements that transiently hide or expose the determinants of receptor binding. These two states are referred to as the \u201cdown\u201d conformation and the \u201cup\u201d conformation, where down corresponds to the receptor-inaccessible state and up corresponds to the receptor-accessible state, which is thought to be less stable (10\u201313). Because of the indispensable function of the S protein, it represents a target for antibody-mediated neutralization, and characterization of the prefusion S structure would provide atomic-level information to guide vaccine design and development.Based on the first reported genome sequence of 2019-nCoV (4), we expressed ectodomain residues 1 to 1208 of 2019-nCoV S, adding two stabilizing proline mutations in the C-terminal S2 fusion machinery using a previous stabilization strategy that proved effective for other betacoronavirus S proteins (11, 14). Figure 1A shows the domain organization of the expression construct, and figure S1 shows the purification process. We obtained ~0.5 mg/liter of the recombinant prefusion-stabilized S ectodomain from FreeStyle 293 cells and purified the protein to homogeneity by affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography (fig. S1). Cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM) grids were prepared using this purified, fully glycosylated S protein, and preliminary screening revealed a high particle density with little aggregation near the edges of the holes.(A) Schematic of 2019-nCoV S primary structure colored by domain. Domains that were excluded from the ectodomain expression construct or could not be visualized in the final map are colored white. SS, signal sequence; S2\u2032, S2\u2032 protease cleavage site; FP, fusion peptide; HR1, heptad repeat 1; CH, central helix; CD, connector domain; HR2, heptad repeat 2; TM, transmembrane domain; CT, cytoplasmic tail. Arrows denote protease cleavage sites. (B) Side and top views of the prefusion structure of the 2019-nCoV S protein with a single RBD in the up conformation. The two RBD down protomers are shown as cryo-EM density in either white or gray and the RBD up protomer is shown in ribbons colored corresponding to the schematic in (A).After collecting and processing 3207 micrograph movies, we obtained a 3.5-\u00c5-resolution three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of an asymmetrical trimer in which a single RBD was observed in the up conformation. (Fig. 1B, fig. S2, and table S1). Because of the small size of the RBD (~21 kDa), the asymmetry of this conformation was not readily apparent until ab initio 3D reconstruction and classification were performed (Fig. 1B and fig. S3). By using the 3D variability feature in cryoSPARC v2 (15), we observed breathing of the S1 subunits as the RBD underwent a hinge-like movement, which likely contributed to the relatively poor local resolution of S1 compared with the more stable S2 subunit (movies S1 and S2). This seemingly stochastic RBD movement has been captured during structural characterization of the closely related betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as the more distantly related alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (10, 11, 13, 16). The observation of this phenomenon in 2019-nCoV S suggests that it shares the same mechanism of triggering that is thought to be conserved among the Coronaviridae, wherein receptor binding to exposed RBDs leads to an unstable three-RBD up conformation that results in shedding of S1 and refolding of S2 (11, 12).Because the S2 subunit appeared to be a symmetric trimer, we performed a 3D refinement imposing C3 symmetry, resulting in a 3.2-\u00c5-resolution map with excellent density for the S2 subunit. Using both maps, we built most of the 2019-nCoV S ectodomain, including glycans at 44 of the 66 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimer (fig. S4). Our final model spans S residues 27 to 1146, with several flexible loops omitted. Like all previously reported coronavirus S ectodomain structures, the density for 2019-nCoV S begins to fade after the connector domain, reflecting the flexibility of the heptad repeat 2 domain in the prefusion conformation (fig. S4A) (13, 16\u201318).The overall structure of 2019-nCoV S resembles that of SARS-CoV S, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 3.8 \u00c5 over 959 C\u03b1 atoms (Fig. 2A). One of the larger differences between these two structures (although still relatively minor) is the position of the RBDs in their respective down conformations. Whereas the SARS-CoV RBD in the down conformation packs tightly against the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the neighboring protomer, the 2019-nCoV RBD in the down conformation is angled closer to the central cavity of the trimer (Fig. 2B). Despite this observed conformational difference, when the individual structural domains of 2019-nCoV S are aligned to their counterparts from SARS-CoV S, they reflect the high degree of structural homology between the two proteins, with the NTDs, RBDs, subdomains 1 and 2 (SD1 and SD2), and S2 subunits yielding individual RMSD values of 2.6 \u00c5, 3.0 \u00c5, 2.7 \u00c5, and 2.0 \u00c5, respectively (Fig. 2C).(A) Single protomer of 2019-nCoV S with the RBD in the down conformation (left) is shown in ribbons colored according to Fig. 1. A protomer of 2019-nCoV S in the RBD up conformation is shown (center) next to a protomer of SARS-CoV S in the RBD up conformation (right), displayed as ribbons and colored white (PDB ID: 6CRZ). (B) RBDs of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV aligned based on the position of the adjacent NTD from the neighboring protomer. The 2019-nCoV RBD is colored green and the SARS-CoV RBD is colored white. The 2019-nCoV NTD is colored blue. (C) Structural domains from 2019-nCoV S have been aligned to their counterparts from SARS-CoV S as follows: NTD (top left), RBD (top right), SD1 and SD2 (bottom left), and S2 (bottom right).2019-nCoV S shares 98% sequence identity with the S protein from the bat coronavirus RaTG13, with the most notable variation arising from an insertion in the S1/S2 protease cleavage site that results in an \u201cRRAR\u201d furin recognition site in 2019-nCoV (19) rather than the single arginine in SARS-CoV (fig. S5) (20\u201323). Notably, amino acid insertions that create a polybasic furin site in a related position in hemagglutinin proteins are often found in highly virulent avian and human influenza viruses (24). In the structure reported here, the S1/S2 junction is in a disordered, solvent-exposed loop. In addition to this insertion of residues in the S1/S2 junction, 29 variant residues exist between 2019-nCoV S and RaTG13 S, with 17 of these positions mapping to the RBD (figs. S5 and S6). We also analyzed the 61 available 2019-nCoV S sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and found that there were only nine amino acid substitutions among all deposited sequences. Most of these substitutions are relatively conservative and are not expected to have a substantial effect on the structure or function of the 2019-nCoV S protein (fig. S6).Recent reports demonstrating that 2019-nCoV S and SARS-CoV S share the same functional host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (22, 25\u201327), prompted us to quantify the kinetics of this interaction by surface plasmon resonance. ACE2 bound to the 2019-nCoV S ectodomain with ~15 nM affinity, which is ~10- to 20-fold higher than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S (Fig. 3A and fig. S7) (14). We also formed a complex of ACE2 bound to the 2019-nCoV S ectodomain and observed it by negative-stain EM, which showed that it strongly resembled the complex formed between SARS-CoV S and ACE2 that has been observed at high resolution by cryo-EM (Fig. 3B) (14, 28). The high affinity of 2019-nCoV S for human ACE2 may contribute to the apparent ease with which 2019-nCoV can spread from human to human (1); however, additional studies are needed to investigate this possibility.(A) Surface plasmon resonance sensorgram showing the binding kinetics for human ACE2 and immobilized 2019-nCoV S. Data are shown as black lines, and the best fit of the data to a 1:1 binding model is shown in red. (B) Negative-stain EM 2D class averages of 2019-nCoV S bound by ACE2. Averages have been rotated so that ACE2 is positioned above the 2019-nCoV S protein with respect to the viral membrane. A diagram depicting the ACE2-bound 2019-nCoV S protein is shown (right) with ACE2 in blue and S protein protomers colored tan, pink, and green.The overall structural homology and shared receptor usage between SARS-CoV S and 2019-nCoV S prompted us to test published SARS-CoV RBD-directed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for cross-reactivity to the 2019-nCoV RBD (Fig. 4A). A 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1 fragment (S residues 319 to 591) was recombinantly expressed, and appropriate folding of this construct was validated by measuring ACE2 binding using biolayer interferometry (BLI) (Fig. 4B). Cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV RBD-directed mAbs S230, m396, and 80R was then evaluated by BLI (12, 29\u201331). Despite the relatively high degree of structural homology between the 2019-nCoV RBD and the SARS-CoV RBD, no binding to the 2019-nCoV RBD could be detected for any of the three mAbs at the concentration tested (1 \u03bcM) (Fig. 4C), in contrast to the strong binding that we observed to the SARS-CoV RBD (fig. S8). Although the epitopes of these three antibodies represent a relatively small percentage of the surface area of the 2019-nCoV RBD, the lack of observed binding suggests that SARS-directed mAbs will not necessarily be cross-reactive and that future antibody isolation and therapeutic design efforts will benefit from using 2019-nCoV S proteins as probes.(A) SARS-CoV RBD shown as a white molecular surface (PDB ID: 2AJF), with residues that vary in the 2019-nCoV RBD colored red. The ACE2-binding site is outlined with a black dashed line. (B) Biolayer interferometry sensorgram showing binding to ACE2 by the 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1. Binding data are shown as a black line, and the best fit of the data to a 1:1 binding model is shown in red. (C) Biolayer interferometry to measure cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV RBD-directed antibodies S230, m396, and 80R. Sensor tips with immobilized antibodies were dipped into wells containing 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1, and the resulting data are shown as a black line.The rapid global spread of 2019-nCoV, which prompted the PHEIC declaration by WHO, signals the urgent need for coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics. Knowing the atomic-level structure of the 2019-nCoV spike will allow for additional protein-engineering efforts that could improve antigenicity and protein expression for vaccine development. The structural data will also facilitate the evaluation of 2019-nCoV spike mutations that will occur as the virus undergoes genetic drift and help to define whether those residues have surface exposure and map to sites of known antibody epitopes for other coronavirus spike proteins. In addition, the structure provides assurance that the protein produced by this construct is homogeneous and in the prefusion conformation, which should maintain the most neutralization-sensitive epitopes when used as candidate vaccine antigens or B cell probes for isolating neutralizing human mAbs. Furthermore, the atomic-level detail will enable the design and screening of small molecules with fusion-inhibiting potential. This information will support precision vaccine design and the discovery of antiviral therapeutics, accelerating medical countermeasure development.science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6483/1260/suppl/DC1Materials and MethodsFigs S1 to S8Table S1Movies S1 and S2References (32\u201341)View/request a protocol for this paper from Bio-protocol.This is an article distributed under the terms of the Science Journals Default License.Vol 367, Issue 648313 March 2020Thank you for your interest in spreading the word about Science.NOTE: We only request your email address so that the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it, and that it is not junk mail.
